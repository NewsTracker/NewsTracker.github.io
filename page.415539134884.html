<h3>Cervantes remains found in Madrid convent, investigators believe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Archaeologists and anthropologists begin the excavation work to find the remains of Cervantes at a church in Madrid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Madrid: In a discovery that could create a new venue for literary pilgrims, Spanish investigators have declared they might have located part of the remains of Miguel de Cervantes, whose novel Don Quixote has enthralled readers over the centuries with stories of its eponymous knight and his servant, Sancho Panza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cervantes, often lauded as having written the first modern novel, died in 1616 after requesting burial in a convent in Madrid where, for almost a year, investigators have been searching the subsoil for bones that they now believe to include some of the author's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Everything coincides to lead us to believe that Cervantes is there," forensics expert Francisco Etxeberria said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Forensic anthropologist Francisco Etxeberria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The investigators cautioned, however, that it may be impossible to guarantee that the bones are those of the writer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Almudena Garcia-Rubio, an archaeologist, said there was "no confirmed genetic identification", although DNA tests were being performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The reason for the extreme deterioration of what appear to be Cervantes' remains lies in the complex history of Madrid's Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in the years following the writer's death in April 1616.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Francisco Jose Marin, a Spanish historian, said he had established beyond doubt that Cervantes, his wife Catalina de Salazar and 15 others had been buried between 1612 and 1630 in the small church of San Ildefonso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That building then became engulfed by the construction and enlargement of the convent over the next century, with the remains of the 17 transferred to the crypt of a new church within the complex at some time between 1698 and 1730.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Armed with these historical certainties, the team of 30 researchers used 3D scanners and ground-penetrating radar as they opened up a forgotten crypt under the church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As many as 240 bodies were uncovered in three burial layers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The vast majority were children from the 18th and 19th centuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Just below the third level of burials, the researchers found a collection of bone fragments lying unprotected on top of the earth next to a coffin in which a chaplain was buried in robes consistent with 17th-century Catholic style.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The tomb with the remains of several individuals, possibly including Cervantes, found in the crypt of the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Photo: J.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two coins from Felipe IV's reign (1621-1665) confirmed that these were the oldest remains in the crypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The remains believed to be those of Cervantes were found below the ground of the crypt of the church, at a depth of about 130 centimetres in a box that contained bones from 10 adults and five children, according to historian Fernando de Prato.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr de Prato said that the forensic team still faced "a lot of work", to separate the bones, perhaps try to reconstruct the bodies and perform DNA testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It would of course have been better to find his remains complete", to establish the identity of Cervantes with certainty, Mr de Prato said, "but I still have the feeling today of having reached the end of a journey."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>During the excavations, the investigators found decayed wood from a coffin with the letters M and C marked out in tacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The discovery of the coffin was announced in January, but it turned out to contain the remains of a child rather than those of the writer, Mr de Prato said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Born near Madrid in 1547, Cervantes has been described as the father of the modern novel for The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha, published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The novel gave the world the word quixotic in acknowledgment of its central character and his adventures, including his joust with windmills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The expression "tilting at windmills" also denotes people who take on imaginary adversaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>His influence on the Spanish language has been so great that it is often referred to as "the language of Cervantes".</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But such recognition as a writer came too late to bring Cervantes any fortune, after a life spent mostly as a soldier - including a five-year spell in captivity, after his naval ship was intercepted by pirates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The author had requested to be buried in the convent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Trinitarian religious order had helped to pay a ransom to release him from slavery after he was captured by Moorish pirates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The discovery of the possible remains comes as Spain and the literary world celebrate this year the 400th anniversary of the publication of the second volume of Don Quixote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Authorities in Madrid are hoping to build a monument within the church to commemorate the writer, with the goal of completing that work by April of next year, the 400th anniversary of his death.</td></tr>

<h3>Nome, Alaska, cheers for native son in Iditarod</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nome always goes all out to welcome the mushers, but this year, one of their own is vying for the championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Aaron Burmeister, 39, was in third place behind defending champion and race leader Dallas Seavey and his father, Mitch Seavey, who was in second place Tuesday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nome residents and visitors are known to leave the bars that populate Front Street in droves as the mushers come off the sea ice and come down the street at the end of the thousand-mile race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But a Burmeister victory could be an all-out celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We have a couple of mushers that race other ventures, but he's the only one that races Iditarod," resident Aaron Cooper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"And I mean, it would be a pretty big celebration if Aaron won it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Stan Hooley, the Iditarod's chief executive officer, said if someone from Nome were to win, "we'd see a celebration at the finish line like we've never seen before."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dallas Seavey was the first musher into the checkpoint at White Mountain, where mushers and their dogs must take a mandatory eight-hour break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Seavey can begin the last 77 miles of the race to Nome at 6:10 p.m. Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If his three-hour lead holds up, that could put him into Nome early Wednesday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But at the checkpoint, Seavey told Anchorage television station KTUU, "Anyone remember last year?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jeff King, a four-time champion, was in a similar position last year with a big lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was 25 miles from the finish line when a sudden snowstorm with unrelenting winds blew him out of the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This is ominously too familiar," Seavey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"A team out in front with a lot of speed was guaranteed to win it, and they didn't."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Seavey said he's not ready to claim victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Behind Burmeister in the standings are Jessie Royer and Aliy Zirkle, who are trying to become the first female winner of the Iditarod since the late Susan Butcher won her fourth title in 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Burmeister was born and raised in Nome and he lives there, even though he also trains an hour outside of Fairbanks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>His father, Richard Burmeister, is an Iditarod veteran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Aaron and his wife, Mandy, have two children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He's a certified teacher and works as a manager in the construction field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>What could a Burmeister win mean?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Well that would be the golden ticket for him and his family," said resident Pat Booth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"'Cause he grew up here in Nome, and he's married to a girl from Nome, and so we just all are really cheering him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Nome's mayor, Denise Michels, gave a hearty laugh when asked if a Burmeister victory could spell the end of her 12 years in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"It would be so awesome if one of our own sons would be able to win the race," Michels said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Of course, all the mushers, they're great, too, but I think that would make it just a perfect cherry topping for the nice snow that we have here if he was able to win."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Poor weather and trail conditions south of the Alaska Range forced the start of the race over a mountain range to Fairbanks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>There were 78 mushers at the start March 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Eight mushers have scratched and one has been disqualified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Two dogs have died in the race, including one on four-time champion Lance Mackey's team.</td></tr>
