<h3>MH370 search 'no closer' to finding wreckage, says Malaysia Airlines</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An investigation into the disappearance of MH370 has cast serious doubt over whether the pilots or any of the crew hijacked the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 carrying 239 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An interim report of the investigation released on Sunday said there were "no behavioural signs of social isolation, change in interests or habits or interest, self-neglect, drug or alcohol abuse of the captain, first officer and the cabin crew."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report said the ability of the plane's captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah to handle stress at work and home was good and he had no history of apathy, anxiety or irritability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The report said there was also nothing to suggest anything sinister in the behaviour of other more junior pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The possibility that one of the pilots or crew hijacked the plane has been one of the most plausible theories about what happened to the missing flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fingers have been pointed at Captain Zaharie who according to some reports had problems with his marriage and was upset with Malaysia's government over its jailing of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the report provides no evidence to support a so-called "rogue pilot" theory, saying Captain Zaharie held bank accounts with his wife, owned two houses and had not taken out an insurance policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The report also revealed the battery of an underwater locator beacon had expired more than a year before the plane vanished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apart from that anomaly, the 584-page report devoted a large chunk to describing the complete normality of the flight, shedding little light on aviation's biggest mystery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The expired battery would have had lesser chance of locating the aircraft in the Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed, even if searchers were in its vicinity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The report said there was no indications of problems with the plane's engines, electrical, mechanical or oxygen systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But it revealed there was massive confusion among civilian and military aviation authorities in the hours after the plane changed course when it was still in the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Malaysia Airlines said on Sunday investigators have no idea what happened to the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We are no closer to finding a resolution," airline chairman Md Nor Yusof told a gathering of the company's staff to mark the one year anniversary of the disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We are still asking and seeking for answers to what happened to MH370," he said, adding the tragedy and chain of events afterwards were unprecedented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak issued a statement saying "together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists," as families of those on board vowed never to give up on the search for wreckage and answers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Najib praised dozens of experts who have been working since April last year to try establish why one of the world's most sophisticated airliners abruptly lost communication and turned around from its scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The plane flew on for thousands of kilometres in the early morning darkness and, according to available data, crashed into a vast expanse of the southern Indian Ocean west of Perth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The disappearance of MH370 is without a precedent and so too is the search - by far the most complex and technically challenging in aviation history," Mr Najib said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"No words can describe the pain the families of those on board are going the lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this difficult to bear," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Najib said Malaysia remains committed to finding the plane while China's foreign minister Wang Yi promised relatives the search would not stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A majority of the passengers were Chinese.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We are reasonably optimistic of success but if we don't succeed in this search there is another search that we intend to make because we owe it to the families of the dead, we owe it to the travelling public, to do whatever we reasonably can to the resolve of this mystery," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The search, costing more than $120 million, is the costliest in aviation history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In late January, Malaysia's government formally declared the flight an accident and said all 239 people were dead, opening the way for Malaysia Airlines to pay compensation to relatives of the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But the statement angered many relatives who said it was premature without any answers or physical evidence of the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A group of relatives called Voice 370 held a Day of Remembrance event at a mall in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>About 30 relatives of the Chinese passengers on board MH370 gathered at a Buddhist temple in central Beijing to mark the anniversary of the plane's disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With a strong police presence watching on, the relatives held signs and wore white t-shirts which said "Never Give Up, Search On".</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The next of kin said they wanted to pray for their loved ones while maintaining pressure on Malaysian authorities, who they believe are concealing information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Since the plane's disappearance, relatives say that Chinese security officials have tightened their watch over them, especially after some began criticising the Chinese government's response to the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We want to show our determination," said Jiang Hui, whose mother was aboard the flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"We are here to pray for our loved ones and we hope they can come back and the truth will come out as soon as possible."</td></tr>

<h3>Bill Clinton defends foreign donations to foundation</h3>

<tr><td>2</td><td>Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, left, and Chelsea Clinton speak at a university conference sponsored by their Clinton Global Initiative at the University of Miami, Saturday, March 7, 2015, in Coral Gables, Fla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CORAL GABLES, Fla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>(AP) - Former President Bill Clinton defended his foundation's acceptance of donations from foreign governments on Saturday, pointing to the track record of his global philanthropy as Hillary Rodham Clinton nears an announcement on a 2016 presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In an interview at the Clinton Global Initiative University, the ex-president sought to address critics who have questioned the receipt of donations from foreign governments while the former first lady served in the State Department and after she departed in early 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"My theory about all of this is disclose everything and then let people make their judgments," Clinton told moderator Larry Wilmore of the cable channel Comedy Central.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I believe we have done a lot more good than harm and I believe this is a good thing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He spoke shortly after Hillary Clinton appeared on stage along with the couple's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, but steered clear of addressing criticism involving her use of a private email account while she served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hillary Clinton also did not talk about the recent scrutiny of the foundation's fundraising practices, instead giving college students a preview of an upcoming report on the progress of women and girls by her foundation's "No Ceilings" project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On the donations flap, Bill Clinton noted that some of the foundation's money has come from Middle Eastern nations, pointing to donations from the United Arab Emirates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Do we agree with everything they do? No. But they're helping us fight ISIS," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Similarly, Bill Clinton said he didn't agree with the entire foreign policy of Saudi Arabia, another donor, but he pointed to its construction of the kingdom's first coeducational institution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said the foundation has received donations from more than 300,000 people since its inception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"You've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In recent days, Hillary Clinton has faced criticism over her use of a private email account while she was secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The disclosures have raised questions over whether Clinton complied with federal rules requiring government officials to retain written communications involving official business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Clinton has requested her emails to be released and the State Department is reviewing the 55,000 pages of emails she has already turned over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Congressional Republicans are investigating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said Hillary Clinton had spent the past week "hiding from the press and voters" and that it was "clear that Hillary Clinton feels the rules that every other American lives by don't apply to her, and today's failure to answer these questions did nothing to allay any of these concerns."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Obama commented publicly on the email controversy for the first time Saturday, telling CBS News that he first heard about the private account through news reports and that he was glad that Hillary Clinton had "instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Asked how the dustup squared with his administration's push for transparency, Obama said Clinton's decision to put them forward "will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Republicans have also assailed the Clinton Foundation's receipt of donations from foreign governments, saying it could create a conflict of interest for the former first lady if she's elected president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Hillary Clinton is building a campaign team and remains the leading Democratic presidential contender if she enters the 2016 campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Her appearance at the University of Miami brought her before an audience of college students in one of the nation's top presidential battleground states and was only a short drive from the home of a potential Republican rival, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Pointing to her upcoming "No Ceiling" report, Hillary Clinton said "unfinished business" remained in the educational and economic opportunities of women and girls and she would speak in detail about it next week in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She said she plans to black out her social media profile images on Sunday to take part in a program called "Not There" to raise awareness about gender inequality.</td></tr>
