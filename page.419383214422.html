<h3>Blatter hits back at Chung over &#039;corrupt&#039; comments</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ZURICH (Reuters) - Outgoing president Sepp Blatter hit back at Chung Mong-joon, one of the candidates to replace him, for labelling FIFA a "corrupt organisation" on Monday and said the South Korean's remarks were "disturbing".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Swiss Blatter also pointed out in a statement issued by football's governing body that Chung was an influential member of FIFA for 17 years until 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 63-year-old billionaire scion of Korea's Hyundai industrial conglomerate launched his bid for the presidency in Paris earlier on Monday with a stinging attack on Blatter and Michel Platini, head of European football's ruling body UEFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Platini is another candidate to replace Blatter at the election on Feb. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is disturbing, to say the least, to hear Dr Chung Mong-joon describe FIFA as a 'corrupt organisation' during a press conference announcing his candidacy," said Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Even more so when one recalls, and as Dr Chung cannot have forgotten, that he was a FIFA vice-president and a FIFA emergency committee member for 17 years from 1994 until 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Regarding personal attacks made by Dr Chung at the same event, I will not comment further than to say that this is particularly disrespectful to all concerned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I would like to stress again that FIFA is dedicated to improving the organisation and will continue to strengthen its governance and accountability," added Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our work in this area continuously evolves and we are focussed on achieving the highest standards for the international football community."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>During his speech and press conference, Chung made several references to corruption at FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Michel Platini was a great football player and he is my friend," said the Korean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"His problem is he does not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the corruption crisis at FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Chung also said "the problem at FIFA is that those mired in corruption, the only thing they are interested in is hiding the corruption".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He added that the core issue for the election "is whether the 40-year-old system of corruption should continue or not".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In a reference to Blatter, Chung added: "The real reason FIFA has become such a corrupt organisation is because the same person and his cronies have been running it for 40 years".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Blatter was secretary general for 17 years before being elected president in 1998.</td></tr>
