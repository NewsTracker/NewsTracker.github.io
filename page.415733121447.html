<tr><td>2</td><td>The rally in Minsk was approved by the authorities and police didn't intervene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has forged close economic, political and military ties with Russia, which has supported the ally with cheap energy and other subsidies.</td></tr>
