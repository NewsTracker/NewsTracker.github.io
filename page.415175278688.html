<h3>Obama holding video talk with European leaders on Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a video conference, Obama and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the EU said they would support and strengthen the role of Europe's OSCE security organization to monitor the so-called Minsk agreements that led to last month's cease-fire between Ukraine's army and Russian-backed separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The "leaders will be ready to decide on further sanctions, if the Minsk agreements are further violated," said the office of European Council President Donald Tusk, who took part in the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fighting has waned substantially in eastern Ukraine in recent days as the cease-fire deal increasingly takes effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But both sides have complained of sporadic violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The U.N. human rights office on Monday raised its toll of the fighting, saying more than 6,000 people have died since the conflict began in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the wake of the fighting and Moscow's annexation last year of the Crimean Peninsula, the EU has imposed visa bans on 151 individuals, including some senior Russian officials and lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It also has imposed economic sanctions, to which Moscow has retaliated with a ban on most Western food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Continued support for Ukraine's battered economy was also discussed during the call, which included British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The leaders also expressed "grave concern" over deteriorating security in Libya and agreed to discuss developments again in the future, Tusk's office said.</td></tr>

<h3>Nigeria's Boko Haram releases beheading video echoing Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>People stand by the wreckage of a car that has been blown up by suspected Boko Haram militants in Nigeria's northeastern city of Maiduguri on March 25, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nigeria's Islamist sect Boko Haram released a video purporting to show it beheading two men, its first online posting using advanced graphics and editing techniques reminiscent of footage from Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The film, released on Monday, shows militants standing behind the two men who are on their knees, their hands tied behind their backs, with one man standing over them, holding a knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One of the men is made to tell the camera that they had been paid by authorities to spy on the militant group, before the film moves to another scene showing their decapitated bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was not possible to confirm the film's authenticity or date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The footage will stoke concerns that Boko Haram, which evolved out of a clerical movement focused on northeast Nigeria, is expanding its scope and seeking inspiration from global militant networks including Al Qaeda and Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The militants who have killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in their bid to carve out an Islamist state in their homeland, have in recent months stepped up cross-border raids into Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan has said Boko Haram is allied to both Al Qaeda and its offshoot Islamic State, though that has not been confirmed by the group itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Boko Haram film's use of graphics, the footage of black-clad militants with a black flag, and the editing to show only the aftermath of the beheading, were particularly reminiscent of footage from Islamic state, which has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria and killed several hostages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the film, one of the men says he comes from Baga in Borno state, and the other says he is from Michika in Adamawa state, both areas where the army says it has recently recaptured territory from Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Past Boko Haram films have been much cruder affairs, often featuring a man identified as leader Abubakar Shekau talking more about local gripes than global jihad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A number of recent releases have included much more gruesome footage of beheadings.</td></tr>
