<h3>RBA keeps close eye on China and Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Reserve Bank will keep a close watch on China's stock markets, the Greek debt crisis and soft local business investment to assess whether further rate cuts are needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The RBA cut the cash rate to a historic low of two per cent in May and has left rates on hold at its June and July meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the minutes of the July meeting, released on Tuesday, the central bank said international and local economic news would play a part in future rate decisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Information to be received over the period ahead on economic and financial conditions would continue to inform the board's assessment of the outlook," the RBA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That assessment would inform "whether the current stance of policy remained appropriate to foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Reserve Bank said economic growth in Australia's major trading partners was around average, but key considerations remained turbulence on China's stock markets and Greece's ongoing debt saga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Recent volatility in Chinese equity markets and potential spillovers from developments in Greece would require close monitoring," the RBA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the direct impact of any further Greek turmoil was likely to be "relatively limited", it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The minutes come after a breakthrough in Greece's debt negotiations with its international creditors on a third bailout deal, and big falls on Chinese equities markets earlier in July despite measures by Chinese authorities to support the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The RBA said the local economic picture remained largely unchanged from previous months, with low interest rates supporting housing investment and consumption growth, while mining and non-mining investment remained weak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Nevertheless non-mining business profits had increased over the past year and surveys suggested that business conditions had generally improved," the RBA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The national housing market was little changed, with Sydney experiencing "notable strength", and the effect of greater regulator scrutiny of investor remains unclear, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Australian dollar's drop against the US dollar to levels not seen since 2009 was not boosting the economy by as much as the bank expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Further depreciation seemed both likely and necessary," the RBA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The bank noted signs of continued improvement in the jobs market, and said inflation remains well contained.</td></tr>
