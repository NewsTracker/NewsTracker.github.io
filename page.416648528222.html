<h3>Dunleavy scores 20, Bulls clobber Bucks 120-66 to advance (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls finally delivered a knockout blow to the Milwaukee Bucks - not literally, although it sure seemed to come close at times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And for all of Chicago's star power, it was Mike Dunleavy in the middle of it all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dunleavy scored 20 points and the Bulls came close to an NBA playoff record, finally putting away the Bucks with a 120-66 victory in Game 6 to clinch their first-round series Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dunleavy seemed to have his biggest impact away from the ball, getting under the young Bucks skins with physical play that drew retaliation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''They had some momentum in the series, won a couple in a row,'' Dunleavy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''We came out on their court and put it on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That's frustrating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Bulls, who move on to face the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round, finished four points from the NBA playoff record for largest margin of victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Minnesota beat St. Louis 133-75 on March 19, 1956.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''It looks a lot better when the ball goes in,'' Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''The thing that you want to make sure of is, sometimes you don't have control over when the ball goes in or doesn't go in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If they are the right shots, you want to shoot them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The game was over early, but it still featured plenty of the intensity and bad blood that marked the first five games of the series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dunleavy drew the foul that led to the ejection of Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo for a flagrant 2 foul just before halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Pau Gasol scored 19 points and Jimmy Butler added 16 for the Bulls, who started the series with a 3-0 lead before two straight wins by the defensive-minded Bucks put them back in position to tie it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Derrick Rose scored 15 points and all five Chicago starters were in double figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''It was definitely a tough battle all series,'' Joakim Noah of the Bulls said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''To just win like that is exactly what you needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>You go into the next series with a lot of confidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In an indication of Milwaukee's misery on offense, no Bucks starter scored more than ZaZa Pachulia's eight points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It was the biggest playoff loss in team history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Bucks lost by 36 points at New York in 1970.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Bucks were 25 of 76 from the field (32.9 percent) while Chicago was 46 of 90 (51.1 percent).</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Antetokounmpo was ejected after a hard foul on Dunleavy during a 3-point attempt that sent him crashing into the front row of fans with 1:34 left in the second quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>After a review, officials ruled it a flagrant 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''Sometimes, you've got to take a hard foul,'' Dunleavy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''We've all been there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It may have been a reaction to a hand to the face that Dunleavy gave Antetokounmpo a little earlier in the game - an incident similar to contact between Dunleavy's arm and Michael Carter-Williams' face near the beginning of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''He kind of got under our guys' skins,'' Pachulia said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''Especially he picked the young guys, he picked the right guys, and unfortunately our guys responded and we got hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Dunleavy and Carter-Williams tangled again in the third quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Dunleavy bumped Carter-Williams, and Carter-Williams retaliated by swinging his left arm and sending Dunleavy to the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Dunleavy was called for an offensive foul, and Carter-Williams earned a technical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Dunleavy played for the Bucks for two seasons before joining the Bulls in 2013-14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It was a rough end to a successful season for the Bucks, who were the league's worst team in 2013-14 but turned it around to earn the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>6 playoff season under Kidd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''They're not a secret anymore,'' Kidd said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The Bucks were never really in this one, though, trailing 34-16 at the end of the first quarter and 65-33 at the half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''We got better,'' Kidd said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>''The whole experience of being in the playoffs, you can't take that away from those guys, no matter if you lose by 40 or you lose by one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>It's a loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>That's it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>It won't come as much consolation to the Bucks, but it's still a good omen for a team working with local and state officials to put together a funding plan for a new arena: Milwaukee fans finally took back the BMO Harris Bradley Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Used to being crowded out by traveling Bulls fans for years, Bucks fans appeared to largely outnumber and drown out their counterparts from Chicago - at least before the game got out of hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Bulls: F Nikola Mirotic finished second in rookie of the year voting, behind Minnesota's Andrew Wiggins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>''I thought he had a terrific year,'' Thibodeau said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>''He has a very bright future and just has to keep working.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>I love the way he approaches things.'' ... Despite the blowout, Thibodeau played his starters well into the third quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Bucks: With 33 points in the first half, the Bucks came one point shy of tying their all-time franchise playoff low for points in the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Milwaukee scored 32 points in the first half against Detroit in 2004.</td></tr>
