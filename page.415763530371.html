<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook executives made the case on Thursday, at its annual developer conference in San Francisco, that initiatives such as its $2 billion purchase of virtual reality headset maker Oculus last year, and the hiring of aerospace experts make sense for the 1.4-billion member social network.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Facebook said the Oculus headset will be released "before long," but did not provide a time frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"After thousands of demos we know we are just on the cusp, just getting there to get that sense of presence where for a moment your conscious brain is overruled by the subconscious that says, 'You are not where you think you are,'" Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer said during his on-stage talk on the second day of the 2-day conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook had never made clear its virtual reality plans, Vlada Bortnik, the founder of app-maker Happy Bits, said at the conference.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>Facebook and Google Inc are building Internet-beaming satellites and drones to connect billions of people who lack Internet access, as the companies compete to become the go-to online hub for consumers and marketers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Facebook's artificial intelligence group is already planning for the flood of new users by developing technology to help them cope with the surge in messages and photos on the social network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If we achieve our first goal, get everyone on the Internet, build services at scale for the entire planet, we create this new problem: so much information you can't consume the stuff that's important to you," CTO Schroepfer said.</td></tr>
