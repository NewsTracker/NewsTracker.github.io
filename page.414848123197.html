<tr><td>3</td><td>Athens is to submit a formal request for a loan extension on Thursday, according to Greek officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The application is also expected to ask for tough austerity conditions to be removed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission's vice president, told reporters on Wednesday at a press conference that both the eurozone and Greece were open to negotiating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The best way forward is to extend the existing program with its conditionality," he said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Germany, who has been a vocal critic of increasing aid to Greece, said it was not open to making changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Simply saying, 'we need more money again and we're not going to do anything any more,' and then insulting people, that absolutely won't work," Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said on German television on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Of course Greece would like to continue receiving credit".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Despite this, government spokesman Gabriel Sakellarides told Greek broadcaster ANT1 they were staying positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We are coming to the table to find a solution. We want to believe we are on a good path and all the deliberations will find a common ground," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Any changes to the current bailout program would have to first be approved by various European parliaments, including Germany.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>Months of negotiations have failed to bring about an agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, EU finance ministers set conditions for its continued financial support of Athens, including Greece leaving reforms in place.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>The European Central Bank (ECB) is also debating whether or not it will continue proving emergency lending assistance to the country's crippled banks.</td></tr>
