<h3>German lawmakers expected to clear way for Greece talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (AP) " The German Parliament is expected to clear the way for negotiations on a new bailout package for Greece, despite misgivings among some conservative lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After a preliminary deal Monday, Germany's government had to go to Parliament to get a mandate for what could be difficult talks on details of the three-year bailout expected to be worth 85 billion euros ($93 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lawmakers were recalled from their summer break and will vote on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition of Germany's biggest parties has around four-fifths of the parliamentary seats and approval looks assured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Still, bailing out Greece isn't popular in Merkel's conservative bloc and 48 of its 311 lawmakers said Thursday that they would vote against.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Her coalition partners, the center-left Social Democrats, appear to be solidly behind the deal.</td></tr>
