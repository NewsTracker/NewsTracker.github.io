<h3>Ferguson voters go to polls to elect 3 City Council members</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FERGUSON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - The next Ferguson City Council will face the daunting task of remaking much of the beleaguered town's leadership, a process that will begin soon after Tuesday's municipal election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Three of the six council seats are up for grabs in the St. Louis County town where 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black, was fatally shot by a white Ferguson police officer in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officer Darren Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing by a grand jury and the Justice Department, but a separate DOJ report blasted Ferguson for racial bias and profiling in the police department and a profit-driven municipal court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fallout from that report led to the resignation of the city manager, police chief, municipal judge and two police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The new city council will be tasked with approving hiring of the replacements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The scrutiny of Ferguson after the shooting found that the town of 21,000 residents has a mostly white police force and city leadership - the mayor and five of the six council members are white - even though blacks make up about two-thirds of residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After Tuesday, the council will add at least one, and maybe two black members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The lone current black councilman, Dwayne James, is not up for re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 3rd Ward race involves two black men, Lee Smith, 76, and Wesley Bell, 40, guaranteeing that an additional black resident will join the council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That ward includes the Canfield Green apartment complex where Brown was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 1st Ward features four candidates, two black and two white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The 2nd Ward race involves two white men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ferguson is not unique in drawing low turnout for municipal elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Turnout last April was 12.3 percent, said Eric Fey, director of elections for St. Louis County.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A strong push was made after the shooting to register more black voters, but Fey said just 562 new voters were added to the rolls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In recent weeks, the focus has been on getting those who are registered to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>U.S. Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>William Lacy Clay, a St. Louis Democrat, was among those going door-to-door over the weekend, encouraging people to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The election is being watched by international media and is drawing get-out-the-vote volunteers involved with several national organizations, including labor unions, groups such as the Organization for Black Struggle, and Working Families Party, a leading voice of the left that helped elect New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio last year.</td></tr>
