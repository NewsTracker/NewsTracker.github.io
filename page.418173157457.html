<h3>Apple conspired to fix e-book prices: U.S. appeals court</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Apple Inc. logo is seen in the lobby of New York City's flagship Apple store January 18, 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK (Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a judge's ruling that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) had conspired with five publishers to increase e-book prices, in a win for the U.S. Justice Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>By a 2-1 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the conspiracy violated federal antitrust law, and that the judge acted properly two years ago in imposing an injunction to prevent a recurrence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The ruling would force Apple to pay consumers $450 million under a 2014 settlement of a class action with 33 state attorneys general and lawyers, unless it files another appeal and wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The settlement was contingent on Apple's civil liability being upheld.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"While we want to put this behind us, the case is about principles and values," Apple said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We know we did nothing wrong back in 2010 and are assessing next steps."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Writing for the majority, Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston said Apple's actions "unreasonably restrained trade," rejecting arguments that the company acted independently with its own business interests in mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The district court did not err in concluding that Apple was more than an innocent bystander," Livingston wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer welcomed the ruling, which he said "confirms that it is unlawful for a company to knowingly participate in a price-fixing conspiracy, whatever its specific role in the conspiracy or reason for joining it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The appeal followed a July 2013 decision by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan that Apple played a "central role" in a conspiracy with publishers to eliminate retail price competition and raise e-book prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Justice Department, which secured the ruling following a non-jury trial, said the scheme caused some e-book prices to rise to $12.99 or $14.99 from the $9.99 price charged by market leader Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The publishers that the Justice Department said conspired with Apple include Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group Inc, News Corp's HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Penguin Group Inc, CBS Corp's Simon & Schuster Inc and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH's Macmillan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Professor Keith Hylton of Boston University School of Law said Tuesday's ruling endorsed an "expansive view" of the law by allowing Apple to be held liable under a less-stringent standard than it advocated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The DOJ could feel emboldened in pursuing those cases with this theory of conspiracy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In a dissenting opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said he would have reversed Cote's 2013 ruling, finding that Apple's behavior was pro-competitive in taking on Amazon, which controlled 90 percent of the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Apple took steps to compete with a monopolist and open the market to more entrants, generating only minor competitive restraints in the process," Jacobs wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Livingston said Jacobs' theory "endorses a concept of marketplace vigilantism that is wholly foreign to the antitrust laws."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The case is U.S. v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Apple Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>13-3741.</td></tr>
