<h3>Clinton Foundation to Continue Accepting Some Foreign Money</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton, who resigned from the foundation's board last week, has faced mounting criticism over the charity's ties to foreign governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Her campaign for the Democratic nomination referred questions about the board's decision to the foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The board of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation said that future donations will only be allowed from the governments of Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom - all nations that previously supported the charity's health, poverty and climate change programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While direct contributions from other governments would be halted, those nations could continue some participation in the Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary program that encourages donors to match contributions from others to tackle international problems without direct donations to the charity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the foundation will stop holding CGI meetings abroad after a final session scheduled for Morocco in May. And most foreign governments will no longer be allowed to sponsor programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The foundation also will begin disclosing its donors every quarter instead of annually - an answer to long-standing criticism that the foundation's once-a-year lists made it difficult to view shifts and trends in the charity's funding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Former President Bill Clinton and other foundation officials have long defended the charity's transparency, but the new move signaled sensitivity to those concerns, particularly as his wife begins her race for the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Last month, while she was still a foundation board member, Hillary Clinton defended the family charity to questions about its reliance on donations from foreign governments, saying the foundation had "hundreds of thousands of donors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An Associated Press analysis of Clinton Foundation donations between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $55 million and $130 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Those governments include the six nations that will be allowed to continue donating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The remaining 10 are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Kuwait, Italy, Brunei, Taiwan and the Dominican Republic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said that under the new disclosure policy, "the Clinton Foundation is reinforcing its commitment to accountability while protecting programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But he also insisted that the old annual disclosure policy went "above and beyond what's required by voluntarily disclosing our more than 300,000 donors on our website for anyone to see."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hillary Clinton had previously agreed with the Obama administration to limit new foreign donations to the foundation while she served as secretary of state, but at least six nations that previously contributed still donated to the charity during her four-year stint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In one case, the foundation failed to notify the State Department about a donation from the government of Algeria.</td></tr>
