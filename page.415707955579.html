<h3>Robert Durst linked to missing Vermont student Lynne Schulze</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, when Durst, owned a health food store in town called All Good Things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Real estate scion Durst, who is awaiting extradition to California to face a murder charge for the 2000 execution-style killing of his friend Susan Berman, was denied bail on Monday in New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead,' police said in a statement, adding they were releasing no further details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Miss Schulze, who was a freshman at Middlebury College, was last across the street from Durst's store and the Vermont bus station around 2pm on December 10, 1971, the Burlington Free Press reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At 12.30pm, she was seen outside All Good Things, eating dried prunes that she had bought inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Schulze case had been reopened in 1992 but police would not say why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Durst was being looked at in connection with five deaths or disappearances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Two women disappeared in California, his first wife vanished in New York, another woman went missing in Texas and now the latest, a teen college student in Vermont.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Durst, who recently featured in the HBO documentary 'The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,' must remain in Louisiana on weapons charges until his next court date on April 2, Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell ruled, finding him a likely flight risk and a potential danger to others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail but argued his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier this month in New Orleans were improper, and that investigators wrongly interviewed him without counsel present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Durst's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to Los Angeles County, where he has been charged with the 2000 murder of longtime friend Susan Berman and could face the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The HBO documentary broadcast Durst being presented with evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's likely killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The final HBO episode aired one day after Durst's arrest at a New Orleans hotel, where he was staying under an alias and had over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask that could fit over his neck and head with salt and pepper hair, authorities have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the country, the agency has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Durst, long estranged from his powerful family with its major New York real estate holdings, appeared in court on Monday with his head shaved, revealing a long scar on the right side of his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He was being held in a prison psych ward in New Orleans where officials have deemed him a suicide risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>James O'Hern, an investigator for the local district attorney's office, testified that authorities tracked Durst down after he placed two calls from a phone at the hotel to the voicemail on his personal phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Also in his room was a scribbled tracking number for a package that authorities later seized, which contained $117,000, O'Hern said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, who reopened an investigation in 2000 into the disappearance of Durst's wife, was also in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Durst's attorney asked her to be removed from the courtroom as a potential witness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Cantrell allowed Pirro, now a Fox News host, to stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Murder suspect Robert Durst is seen with a newly-shaved head as he sits in a hearing in this court sketch in New Orleans, Louisiana on Monday.</td></tr>
