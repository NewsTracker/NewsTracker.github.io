<tr><td>3</td><td>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Students frustrated over a new standardized test walked out of schools around New Mexico in protest Monday as the new exam was being given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The backlash came as millions of U.S. students started taking more rigorous exams aligned with Common Core standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many parents and students around the country have opted out of the exams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Others are lobbying lawmakers and education officials for change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The test measures student achievement and can be used in teacher evaluations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Opponents say the exams distract from real learning, put added stress on students and staff members, and waste resources, especially in poor districts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A few hundred students at Albuquerque High School defied warnings from administrators that the teens would not graduate and could face discipline as a result of the walkout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Students took to the sidewalks near the school with signs and chanted as supporters honked their horns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Julie Guevara, 16, said students are tired of the testing and believe it's taking away from their overall education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We hope the governor hears us and does something about this," Guevara said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We're not going away and plan to do this again until the testing is done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The walkouts and demonstrations began last week in Santa Fe then continued in Carlsbad on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Students from several Las Cruces schools joined the movement Monday by walking out of class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some carried signs that read "More teaching, less testing," and "Out the door with Common Core."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>New Mexico schools were administering the tests known as the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The test, debuting this year in 11 other states, is among a new generation of tests aligned to Common Core - standards adopted by 43 states that outline the math and language skills students should master in each grade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>New Mexico Education Secretary Hanna Skandera has defended the exams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There's a lot of anxiety that is not based on facts or truths about this assessment," Skandera told The New Mexican on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"That stresses the importance of making sure we as adults are putting good information into the hands of our students."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Skandera said the test isn't an additional exam, just a better version of the state standards exam it replaced.</td></tr>
