<h3>BMW anybody? Carmakers to gain most from weak euro</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The credit ratings provider said the falling euro would be "positive for companies that have the majority of their cost bases in the euro area with significant sales to regions outside it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>These included German premium auto manufacturers such as BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, which export a large share of their production to external markets including the U.S.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Germany companies were also seen as the major beneficiaries in the chemicals sector, with Moody's naming K&S and Lanxess as those most likely to gain, given that potash and synthetic rubber are "typically U.S. dollar markets."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Moody's added that the hotels and tourism sector would also receive a boost, due to increased demand as euro area destinations became cheaper for travelers from overseas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Since the start of last year, the euro has fallen by around 12.5 percent again U.K. sterling to 0.73 on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It has slipped 19 percent against the U.S. dollar to $1.11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Wednesday, Moody's said it had lowered its forecast for the euro-dollar exchange rate to 1.10 through 2015 and 1.13 in 2016, adding that it did not expect any major recovery in the single currency before 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"In general, a weaker euro boosts the price competitiveness of euro area exports, which account for about 25 percent of Europe's gross domestic product," the ratings agency said in a research note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"However, a lower euro exchange rate will raise import prices and increase the cost of inputs that are denominated in currencies other than the euro."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Moody's said the low euro would prove "mildly negative" for non-food retailers, while airlines would suffer the most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"While demand for flights to Europe might increase, driven by the rising popularity of euro area destinations, most of this rising demand will be captured by non-European airlines," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"In addition, flying from Europe to other continents will become less attractive. Furthermore, the positive effect of falling oil prices will be partially offset by the weakening euro, as global oil prices are quoted in U.S. dollars making fuel purchases more expensive for European airlines."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a February research note, Goldman Sachs Asset Management said the weak euro could boost revenues for many of the region's companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"With 54 percent of aggregate corporate revenues being generated outside of Europe, we look for a weakening euro to benefit the competitiveness and profitability of many European companies through a more competitive export business and higher profits when converting overseas profits back into the local euro currency," the bank said.</td></tr>

<h3>Boston Marathon bomb victims arrive for trial?s start</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two busloads of people hurt in the bombings arrived at the federal courthouse at 7:30 a.m. Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They entered through a side entrance, away from reporters and photographers gathered at the main entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Marc Fucarile, who lost a leg in the attack, went in the front entrance, but did not speak to reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lawyers for suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have made it clear they will try to show that at the time of the bombings he was influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan, who died following a shootout with police days after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prosecutors say Dzhokhar was an equal and willing participant in the plot that killed three and hurt more than 260.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Two dramatically different portraits of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are expected to emerge when prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers give their opening statements at his federal death penalty trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Was he a submissive, adoring younger brother who only followed directions given by his older, radicalized brother?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Or was he a willing, active participant in the attacks?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The trial that begins Wednesday is expected to be one of the most closely watched terror cases in years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers have made it clear they will try to show that at the time of the bombings, Tsarnaev, then 19, looked up to his older brother, Tamerlan, 26, and was heavily influenced by him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They plan to portray Tamerlan as the mastermind of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He died following a shootout with police days after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But prosecutors say Dzhokhar was an equal participant who acted of his own free will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He faces 30 charges in the bombings and the fatal shooting days later of a police officer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Seventeen of the charges carry the possibility of the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 were hurt when twin bombs exploded near the finish line seconds apart on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tsarnaev's trial will be held in U.S. District Court in Boston under extremely tight security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>During jury selection, dozens of police officers and federal security officers were stationed inside and outside the courthouse, armed U.S. Coast Guard boats patrolled Boston Harbor and a side street leading to the courthouse was blocked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers fought right up until the last minute to have the trial moved outside of Massachusetts, arguing that the emotional impact of the bombings ran too deep in the state and too many people had personal connections to the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Their requests were rejected by Judge George O'Toole Jr. and the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A jury of 10 women and eight men were chosen Tuesday to hear the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The trial will be split into two phases - one phase to decide guilt and the other to decide punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If Tsarnaev is convicted, the same jury will decide whether he's sentenced to life in prison or death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The trial is expected to last three to four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The list of witnesses remains sealed from public view, but among those expected to testify are first responders who treated the wounded, marathon spectators and victims who were badly injured in the explosions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb will lay out the prosecution's case in opening statements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Attorney Judy Clarke, a well-known death penalty opponent, will deliver the opening statement for the defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Clarke has saved a string of high-profile clients from the death penalty, including: Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph; Unabomber Ted Kaczynski; and Jared Loughner, the man who killed six people and wounded former U.S. Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Gabrielle Giffords in a 2011 shooting rampage in Tucson, Arizona.</td></tr>
