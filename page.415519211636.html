<h3>An Apple on the wrist? Not on my watch, Tim</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>John Crudele says Tim Cook's newest product, the Apple Watch, isn't for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>I was reluctant to write this column last week because I didn't think it was safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>I was, quite frankly, afraid of the thousands of zealots who - radicalized by a certain movement - would bombard me with hateful emails and, quite possibly, accost me verbally on the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But I think the situation has finally cooled enough so I can say what I couldn't last week: I think the Apple Watch is a stupid idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Not only the Apple Watch but also anything that I'm supposed to put on my wrist that acts just like the very smart iPhone that I carry in the left pocket of my pants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>(Trust me, it's there - I don't want you to go rummaging around looking for it.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sadly, we have come to the point in personal computer technology where there will be nothing more than tiny, incremental advancements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And paying hundreds to thousands of dollars so that I won't have to reach into my pocket to check emails or know the weather or find out which telemarketer just called is silly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Let me straighten something out right now so you don't think I'm one of those old "get off my lawn" type of cranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Personal computing technology has been wonderful for me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm writing this column from the comfort of my home because technology has made it possible to avoid my long commute into the newsroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I even have a tablet computer produced by Tim Cook's Apple in case the seat of the chair in my office gets too hard and I want to relocate to the more comfortable couch in my family room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So you see, I love technology and everything it does to make my life better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I let Apple get into my pants a long time ago and it's been my pleasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And like just about everyone else, I recently upgraded to an iPhone 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I bought the smaller-size version with the bigger memory because I felt that sticking the gigantic -inch model into my pants pocket risked chafing during the humid months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>So, I hope you get my point - I am on board with technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Maybe even a little overboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Which gets me to my main point: Since I have a computer on my desk and in my family room and in my pocket, why do I need one on my wrist?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Why can't I just take that wrist, send it into my pocket and use the iPhone contained therein?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>As you've probably heard, Apple introduced its watch last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It was greeted by the media with the kind of fanfare usually reserved for war heroes, Pulitzer Prizes or a World Series win by a home team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Apple got a ton of publicity - the kind that run-of-the-mill companies would have to pay for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>What does the Apple Watch do that deserves such hype?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Well, it seems to be able to measure your heart rate (which everyone, of course, needs to do constantly), connect to the Internet, send a message, tap you if you get a message, and connect to the iPhone five inches away in your pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Important stuff like that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>I'm pretty sure it can also help you tell time, although that doesn't seem to be a major emphasis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>And you get all this for upwards of $350.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Analysts are estimating Apple will sell 10 million to 32 million watches this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>One Bozo even predicted sales of 1 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>And along the way, I met occasionally with Steve Jobs, the late Apple guru who created major advances in technology and in mankind's productivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>I can't speak for the dead, but I suspect Jobs would be a little embarrassed that the Apple Watch achieves so little.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Isn't it time Apple started spending some of its many billions in cash on something that will make mankind truly better, rather than invest gobs of money in a crazy timepiece?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Federal Reserve is meeting this week and, in all likelihood, will decide to toughen its wording about interest rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>As I said last Thursday: I favor raising rates but I don't think the Fed will ultimately do it anytime soon because the economy isn't nearly as strong as rogue employment statistics are showing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>You already got that spiel: The Census Bureau is sloppy when putting together the unemployment report and the Labor Department makes crazy assumptions when it adds up the monthly new job stats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Fed?</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The poor deluded Fed is going to be misled until it finally catches on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Here are a couple of other crazy things from the recent employment report that I couldn't fit into the last column but the Fed ought to know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Economist Dean Baker at the Center for Economic and Policy Research points out that average wage gain for the past three months was a weak 1.8 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>That's down from an also not very impressive 2 percent gain over the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Other oddities in the recent data: There were 12,300 jobs added in the courier sector and 21,300 jobs in educational services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Is the demand for delivery people and teachers really that strong or is this just a data glitch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>And could construction really have added 29,000 jobs in February - considering there was exceptionally cold weather throughout the US and other data show spending on construction to be flat?</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>And how is it possible that 58,700 new restaurant jobs were created last month?</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Baker says that's the largest monthly gain in that segment of the economy since November 2000.</td></tr>

<h3>Relief teams reach Vanuatu's cyclone-hit outer islands</h3>

<tr><td>22</td><td>Relief workers rushed to deliver desperately needed food and water Wednesday to survivors living on Vanuatu's outer islands, after a monstrous cyclone wiped out entire villages and flattened vast swathes of the South Pacific nation's landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Teams of aid workers and government officials were planning to send a boat packed with supplies to hard-hit Tanna Island, where aerial assessments showed more than 80 percent of homes or buildings had been partially or completely destroyed by Cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Lack of food was a growing worry for those who survived the storm, which packed winds of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour when it struck Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Everyone in Tanna and other islands in the south, they really live subsistence lives, so they grow what they need for a short period. ... And the reality is that much of that would have been washed away by this storm," said Tom Perry, spokesman for CARE Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"That's a grave concern because we desperately need to get food to people soon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Flyover crews who surveyed the outer islands saw a flattened landscape and widespread destruction, with survivors below trying to signal them for help, said Colin Collett van Rooyen, Vanuatu director for aid group Oxfam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Teams of aid workers and government officials carrying medical and sanitation supplies, water, food and shelter equipment finally managed to land on Tanna and neighboring Erromango Island on Tuesday, after being stymied in their efforts for days by poor weather and a breakdown in the nation's communications networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The two islands were directly in the path of the storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>An aerial assessment showed extensive damage on Erromango, with communities ranging from 70 percent to 100 percent destroyed on the archipelago's fourth-largest island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>On other islands, Collett van Rooyen said plane crews saw people had made big, white "H'' marks on the ground in multiple villages, and people on Tongoa island flashed mirrors to attract attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Radio and telephone communications with the outer islands were just beginning to be restored, but remained patchy four days after Cyclone Pam tore through the islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Meanwhile, fears of a measles outbreak prompted aid workers to launch an emergency vaccination drive for children across Vanuatu, which has low rates of immunization and already suffered one outbreak of the disease earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Teams were traveling to evacuation centers and other storm-ravaged areas around Port Vila to vaccinate children, provide Vitamin A and hand out bed nets to help stave off mosquito-borne malaria, according to UNICEF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that 11 people were confirmed dead, including five on Tanna, lowering their earlier report of 24 casualties after realizing some of the victims had been counted more than once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Officials with the National Disaster Management Office said they had no accurate figures on how many were dead, and aid agencies reported varying numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The confusion reflects the difficulty of handling a disaster that struck whole communities on remote islands with a near-total communications blackout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Vanuatu is a challenging place at the best of times, in the sense of getting around and logistics," Perry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"So a situation like this is pretty testing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Baldwin Lonsdale, Vanuatu's president, returned to his country on Tuesday night from Japan, where had been attending a U.N. disaster conference when the cyclone struck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"I trust the people of Vanuatu. I trust my government. I trust the people that they will stand united together as a nation and to rebuild the nation," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Poor weather and communications issues have hampered relief workers efforts to reach the outer islands for days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Most of the islands have no airports and those that do have only small landing strips that are tricky for large supply planes to navigate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>On the main island of Efate, bridges were down outside Port Vila, impeding vehicle traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"There are over 80 islands that make up Vanuatu and on a good, sunny day outside of cyclone season it's difficult to get to many of them," said Collett van Rooyen of Oxfam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The destruction on Tanna was significantly worse than in the nation's capital of Port Vila, where Pam destroyed or damaged 90 percent of the buildings, Perry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"The airport was badly damaged, the hospital was badly damaged but still functioning ... there's one doctor there at the moment," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"It's obviously a pretty trying situation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>About 47,000 people live in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 3,300 people were sheltering in dozens of evacuation centers on the main island of Efate and in the provinces of Torba and Penama.</td></tr>
