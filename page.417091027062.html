<tr><td>2</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court has agreed that Samsung illegally copied some of the patented features in Apple's iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the court sided with Samsung on one point in a long-running dispute, which means the South Korean company may end up paying less than the $930 million in damages originally awarded in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The appellate court upheld most of the conclusions reached by a federal jury in California, after a closely watched trial in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple had complained that Samsung smartphones copied the iPhone and infringed on Apple's technology patents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the appeals court, based in Washington, D.C., said Monday that Apple can't claim damages for copying the overall appearance of the iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That could reduce the damage award by about $382 million, according to Samsung's court filings.</td></tr>
