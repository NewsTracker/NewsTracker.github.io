<h3>Fugitive ex-U.S. spy Snowden in talks on returning home: lawyer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In Washington, U.S. officials said they would welcome Snowden's return to the United States but he would have to face criminal charges which have been filed against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, who has links to the Kremlin, was speaking at a news conference to present a book he has written about his client.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Moscow granted Snowden asylum in 2013, straining already tense ties with Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I won't keep it secret that he... wants to return back home. And we are doing everything possible now to solve this issue. There is a group of U.S. lawyers, there is also a group of German lawyers and I'm dealing with it on the Russian side."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The United States wants Snowden to stand trial for leaking extensive secrets of electronic surveillance programs by the National Security Agency (NSA).</td></tr>

<h3>Obama Strategy in Health Law Case: Have No Backup</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Administration officials insist that any steps they could take to prepare for the potential crisis would be politically unworkable and ineffective, and that pursuing them would wrongly signal to the justices that reasonable solutions existed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The do-nothing strategy is meant to reinforce for the court what White House officials believe: that a loss in the health care case would be unavoidably disastrous for millions of people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There are no contingency plans in place if the court invalidates the Affordable Care Act subsidies that 7.5 million people in 34 states are receiving, administration officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No one is strategizing with governors or insurance company executives or lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There is no public relations plan to reassure people who might suddenly have to pay more for insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If the court rejects the subsidies - a decision unlikely to arrive until the end of the session in late June or early July - health experts said premiums could triple within weeks, causing millions of people to lose coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That could quickly lead to a collapse of the health insurance markets in two-thirds of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"If they rule against us, we'll have to take a look at what our options are. But I'm not going to anticipate that," President Obama said Monday in an interview with Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'm not going to anticipate bad law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The strategy echoes the administration's refusal through most of 2012 to acknowledge any planning for the effect of across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration, insisting that the draconian cuts would never come to pass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>(They did.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Also in 2012, the White House and its allies said there were no plans for the Supreme Court ruling on a challenge to the health law's individual mandate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>(The court upheld the mandate.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the current health care case, legal experts said the White House was savvy in making clear that the situation was dire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They said the justices regularly considered the broader effect of their decisions and often took into account how the executive branch or Congress might respond to a ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Jeffrey L. Fisher, a law professor at Stanford University, said the justices are likely to talk about the administration's lack of contingency plans when they meet behind closed doors on Friday for their first conference after hearing arguments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"They are going to think about whether they buy it, whether they think it's strategy," Mr. Fisher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's something that a court would traditionally at least put into the melting pot of consideration."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The latest legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act was brought by opponents who say Congress authorized subsidies to be issued only to people who signed up for coverage in one of 17 state-run marketplaces, not those who enrolled through the federal HealthCare.gov website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Government lawyers say lawmakers intended the subsidies to be available everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr. Obama's advisers continue to say they are confident the law will survive the court challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But if it does not, within weeks of the ruling the government will have to stop sending tax credits to insurance companies on behalf of the millions who signed up through HealthCare.gov and were promised hefty subsidies to offset the cost of premiums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Most of those people would no longer be required by the law's individual mandate to have insurance, because part of the law provides exemptions when affordable insurance is not available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>As a result, all but the sickest would choose to cancel their insurance, experts predicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>With healthy people no longer choosing to be covered, experts said, most insurance companies would pull out of the markets in those states rather than cover only the sickest - and most expensive - customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The result would be a "death spiral," according to the Supreme Court brief filed by America's Health Insurance Plans, the nation's health insurance trade group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"It would leave consumers in those states with a more unstable market and far higher costs," the group argued in the brief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Soon after the ruling, health care experts said, the White House could work with lawmakers to pass new legislation clarifying that the subsidies should be available everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But that would require the unlikely support of Republicans who have fiercely opposed the president's law and sought to repeal it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"It would take a wrecking ball to a major part of the Affordable Care Act," Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said of a loss in the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"It's hard to see how it would be fixed, absent legislation. And Republicans have made it clear they have no interest in fixing it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Experts said the administration could encourage more states to set up their own insurance marketplaces, which are permitted to provide subsidies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Health experts said the administration could also provide waivers, financial assistance or technical expertise to help the states, although the process could take years to complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>States with a Republican governor or legislature are likely to refuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The federal government could also approve the formation of regional insurance marketplaces, but political leaders in the states would have to agree to participate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"There aren't any magic solutions here," said Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>If the court throws out the subsidies, experts say, it is unclear whether Mr. Obama, the court or Republicans will be blamed for the confusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"A court decision would unleash a giant game of political chicken," said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that does research on health care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"How that ends up would depend a lot on who is getting the blame for the chaos that would ensue."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The situation has already enraged the administration's Republican critics, who hope the court will do what they have been unable to accomplish in Congress: unravel the president's chief domestic accomplishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"By admitting they have no contingency plan to assist the millions that may lose subsidies, the administration confirms how the misguided law is unworkable for the American people," Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Mr. Hatch is part of a Republican group that is working on proposals to help stabilize the insurance markets in the aftermath of a ruling against the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He said the goal of the group's efforts was to eventually repeal and replace the president's health care law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"We would provide financial assistance to help Americans keep the coverage they picked for a transitional period," Mr. Hatch and two other senators wrote in a letter in The Washington Post this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>In the House, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and several other lawmakers are proposing legislation to allow states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act and to provide tax credits to buy health insurance that could help people who might lose their subsidies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The Republican lawmakers have not offered details of their proposals, but Mr. Obama's allies said they expected the Republicans to do little to ease the crisis if people could no longer receive subsidies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"They should not be under any illusions that you can easily pick up the pieces," Mr. Van Hollen said of the nine justices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>He said the Supreme Court should keep that in mind as it heard the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"If they render a decision that blows a hole in the law," Mr. Van Hollen said, "there is no tidy fix to this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 4, 2015, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Obama's Plan: Signal to Justices They're Health Law's Only Hope.</td></tr>
