<h3>Blatter to quit as FIFA president</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA president Joseph Blatter says he will resign from soccer's governing body, and has called for an extraordinary congress to elect his successor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I will organise an extraordinary congress for a replacement for me as president," he said at a hastily convened press conference in Zurich on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I will not stand. I am now free from the constraints of an election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I will be in a position to focus on profound reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>For many years we have called for reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blatter's decision will end 17 years in charge of FIFA and comes four days after the 79-year-old Swiss was elected for a fifth four-year term as head of football's world governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Blatter will carry out his functions as FIFA president until a successor is elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said there would be significant reforms to be driven by Domenico Scala, the chairman of FIFA's audit and compliance Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"FIFA's interest are dear to me. That's why I have taken this decision. What counts most for me, is the institution of FIFA and football around the world," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Blatter has asked the executive committee to organise an extraordinary congress as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The decision came on a day when it emerged that US authorities investigating corruption believe FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke was the top FIFA official behind a payment of $US10 million ($A13.15 million) to accounts controlled by a former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who is now under criminal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Authorities are investigating the transfer of the sum, paid by FIFA on behalf of 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa, which had been unable to pay directly from government funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At the Zurich press conference, Scala said that based on FIFA statutes a four-month notice is required for any presidential elections to be held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>FIFA also needed time to vet potential candidates and for the candidates to present their "vision" for FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The timing of the extraordinary FIFA congress will ultimately be up to the executive committee and likely to be between December and March," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Scala said he was "dedicated to putting into place the conditions for the election of a new president. There will be reforms to how the elections are conducted".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He added: "FIFA is determined to address the issues that are afflicting FIFA. We want to fundamentally reform the way in which people see FIFA".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In a first reaction, UEFA president Michel Platini, seen as a possible candidate to replace Blatter, said of Blatter's decision: "It was a difficult decision. A brave decision. The right decision".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The dramatic developments came on a day when FIFA had been moved to explain a payment of the $US10 million to accounts held by Warner, part of the US investigations and indictments made last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The US indictments do not identify Valcke, the right-hand man to Blatter at FIFA, as a co-conspirator or say the high-ranking official knew that the money was being used as a bribe, the Times report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Warner, the former head of the Central and North American soccer body CONCACAF, was one of 14 people indicted in the United States last week on bribery and corruption charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Warner is alleged to have taken a bribe in exchange for helping South Africa secure the right to host the 2010 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In a statement earlier in the day , FIFA said the money was paid to Warner following a request by the South African government to "support the African diaspora in Caribbean countries as part of the World Cup legacy".</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>FIFA said the $US10 million was authorised by the then chairman of the finance committee, the late Julio Grondona, and "executed in accordance with the Organisation Regulations of FIFA".</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Valcke meanwhile will not be travelling to Canada as planned for the opening game Saturday of the women's World Cup, FIFA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A spokeswoman said that "due to the current situation" it was important for Valcke to attend matters at FIFA headquarters in Zurich South African has denied paying a bribe to Warner in connection with the 2010 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Warner, a Trinidad and Tobago politician, is facing extradition to the United States on bribery and racketeering charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Fourteen present and former FIFA officials and corporate executives have been charged by the US justice department in connection with bribery, corruption and money laundering.</td></tr>
