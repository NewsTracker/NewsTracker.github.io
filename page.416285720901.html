<h3>Yahoo chooses to stay with Microsoft in updated search deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An agreement announced Thursday extends a search partnership that Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft Corp. forged in 2009 while they were being led by different CEOs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Current Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer had the option of terminating the relationship under a clause triggered earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The two are trying to chip away at Google's dominance of Internet searches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They haven't had much success so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google still controls two-thirds of the U.S. search market and holds an even larger share in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mayer spent 12 years helping Google build its lucrative lead in before becoming Yahoo's CEO in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As has been the case since the companies formed their alliance, Microsoft's technology will power most of the search results on Yahoo's sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In return, Yahoo will receive most of the revenue from the ads posted alongside the search results on its sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The original deal called for Microsoft to pay 88 percent of the search revenue to Yahoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The ad commission rose to 90 percent in late February, according to regulatory filings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The companies said their economic arrangement won't change under the revised agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The revised contract gives Yahoo more control over the how its search page looks and works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There will be a few differences in how the companies sell ads under the new agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Investors evidently don't think much is going to change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Yahoo's stock gained 5 cents to close Thursday at $45.78 while Microsoft shares shed 10 cents to close at $42.16.</td></tr>
