<h3>Greinke extends scoreless streak, Dodgers blank Phillies 6-0 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Zack Greinke's personality dictates that he doesn't pound his chest over his current shutout streak - or his chances of starting in next week's All-Star Game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>All he concentrated on Thursday night were the things that helped him navigate another near-flawless outing against the Philadelphia Phillies, who managed only one hit off the right-hander through eight innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greinke extended his career-high scoreless streak to 35 2-3 innings and lowered his major league-best ERA to 1.39 in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 6-0 victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''Everything was pretty good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The location was good and I got ahead in the count,'' said Greinke, who struck out eight, walked none and retired his final 21 batters after giving up a leadoff single in the second to Ryan Howard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''When you get a couple of outs and no one's on base, you can attack them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And when we got a couple of runs, I could attack even more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>So it was the perfect combination of things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Adrian Gonzalez hit a two-run homer and Yasiel Puig ended an RBI drought of 51 at-bats with a two-run homer and two-run double for the NL West leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Los Angeles took three of four from the big league-worst Phillies and extended its division lead to 5 1/2 games over the idle Giants and Diamondbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greinke (8-2) threw 94 pitches in his last outing before heading to Cincinnati for his third All-Star Game - and he made a strong case to be the National League starter next Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He followed up Clayton Kershaw's gem Wednesday night, when the reigning NL MVP and three-time Cy Young Award winner struck out 13 in an eight-hit shutout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''It was all Greinke,'' Phillies interim manager Pete Mackanin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''He was more impressive than the guy last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Greinke hasn't allowed a run since June 13 at San Diego, when Justin Upton hit a go-ahead solo homer in the eighth inning to help the Padres beat him 2-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>His longest scoreless streak prior to this season was 24 innings in April 2009 with Kansas City, when he won the AL Cy Young Award with a 2.16 ERA and 16 wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''The things he's been doing so far have been great.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He's almost been perfect,'' batterymate Yasmani Grandal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''You can't ask for anything else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rookie right-hander Severino Gonzalez (3-3) gave up four runs and five hits through 5 2-3 innings in his seventh major league start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Gonzalez has yielded 27 earned runs and 44 hits in 30 2-3 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Gonzalez walked Grandal with two outs in the fourth and hit Andre Ethier on the right arm with an 0-2 pitch before Puig lined an 0-1 delivery into the right-field corner for a double that gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The RBIs were Puig's first since his two-run single against San Francisco's Tim Lincecum on June 21 at Dodger Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Adrian Gonzalez, heading to his fifth All-Star Game next week, made it 4-0 in the sixth with his 17th homer after a leadoff single by Howie Kendrick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Puig added his fourth of the season in the eighth against Hector Neris after a single by Grandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Jimmy Rollins was 5 for 15 with a homer and five RBIs in his first series against Philadelphia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He spent his first 15 seasons with the Phillies and left as their career hits leader when the Dodgers traded for him in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The three-time All-Star shortstop was the 2007 NL MVP, a year before he helped the Phillies win their first World Series title since 1980.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''They were just games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I didn't enjoy it any more than any other series,'' Rollins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''Everybody wants there to be a lot made of that being my former team, but they were trying to get me out and I was trying to get hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Phillies relievers Justin De Fratus and Jake Diekman were escorted to the press box by a club official before batting practice so they could meet and chat with Vin Scully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Hall of Fame broadcaster's first season with the Dodgers was 1950 - when Philadelphia's ''Whiz Kids'' won the team's first pennant in 35 years by beating the Dodgers on the final day of the season at Ebbets Field on Dick Sisler's 10th-inning homer off Don Newcombe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Phillies: A matchup of World Series MVPs - LHP Cole Hamels (2008) and LHP Madison Bumgarner (2014) - will serve as the opening act in a three-game series at San Francisco on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Hamels (5-6) is 0-3 with a 3.03 ERA over his last seven starts after winning four in a row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Dodgers: RHP Mike Bolsinger (4-3) has allowed only three home runs in 67 innings this season heading into Friday night's series opener against Milwaukee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But four of the 10 homers he has given up in the majors have been hit by the Brewers.</td></tr>
