<h3>Egypt's arrest of Al-Jazeera journalist poses political problem for Germany</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ahmed Mansour is a prominent journalist with the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera broadcaster's Arabic service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cairo: A high-profile Al-Jazeera journalist arrested in Berlin at the request of Egypt said he expected to soon face a judge who would decide whether to extradite him, in a case that could embarrass Germany and renew questions about Cairo's crackdown on dissent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ahmed Mansour, a leading talk show host on the Qatari channel's Arabic service, was arrested at a Berlin airport on Saturday, the latest Al-Jazeera journalist to be pursued by the Egyptian authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A protest rally in Berlin on Sunday demanded the release of Ahmed Mansour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egypt accuses Al-Jazeera of being a mouthpiece of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi removed from power in 2013 when he was army chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Egypt called the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Both the television channel and the Brotherhood reject the allegations made by Egyptian authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mansour told Al-Jazeera by telephone: "The German authorities told me that we are dealing with an international criminal case" and a judge would decide whether he should be extradited to Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Cairo court sentenced Mansour, who has dual Egyptian and British citizenship, to 15 years in prison in absentia last year on a charge of torturing a lawyer in 2011 in Tahrir Square, the focus of the uprising that toppled veteran autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Al-Jazeera said at the time the charge was false and an attempt to silence Mansour, known to viewers across the Arab world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Saad Djebbar, a lawyer for Al-Jazeera, said Mansour was arrested on Saturday as he tried to board a Qatar Airways flight to Doha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Badr Abdelatty said Cairo was liaising with the German authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"He is accused of a crime and was sentenced so of course we have called for him to be returned," he told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Critics accuse the West of turning a blind eye towards what they say is Egypt's crackdown on dissent and freedom of speech in favour of improved economic ties and security cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mansour's arrest may bring to a head Germany's divisions over how to deal with Egypt, a country that is a valuable political ally and business partner, but also accused of widespread human rights abuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sisi visited Germany this month at Chancellor Angela Merkel's invitation, but he was snubbed by the speaker of Germany's parliament who cancelled a meeting with him, citing rights violations in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Also during the visit, German company Siemens signed a multi-billion euro deal with Egypt to supply gas and wind power plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The arrest of (Mansour) throws up many questions which need to be cleared up as soon as possible since Germany must not be a henchman of Egypt's politically controlled justice system," Niels Annen, foreign policy spokesman for the Social Democrats in the German parliament, told Spiegel Online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Egypt released Australian Al-Jazeera journalist Peter Greste in February this year after 400 days in prison on charges that included aiding a terrorist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mohamed Fahmy, a naturalised Canadian who has given up his Egyptian citizenship, and Egyptian Baher Mohamed were released on bail in February after spending more than a year in custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The journalists were originally sentenced to between seven and 10 years in prison on charges including spreading lies to help a terrorist organisation, which they have denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Egypt's high court ordered a retrial in January.</td></tr>
