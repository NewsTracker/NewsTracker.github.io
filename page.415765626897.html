<h3>Robinson says Ferguson&#039;s ready for Raiders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sydney Roosters ace Blake Ferguson is set for the extra attention when he faces his old Canberra teammates for the first time since being sacked by the Raiders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson believes Blake Ferguson is mature enough to handle any extra attention that inevitably comes his way in Sunday's NRL showdown with Canberra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fresh from his two-try heroics against Penrith on Monday night, Ferguson confronts his past when he faces the Raiders for the first time since being sacked by the club in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's the same prep for him and he's started the week very well," Robinson said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There is no reason I should say anything different to what I say every week about how to prepare for a game because we're about trying to get Blake right to play, not about who the opposition is and how he should react to that."</td></tr>
