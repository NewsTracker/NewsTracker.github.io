<h3>Hunt for ancient royal tomb in Mexico takes mercurial twist</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TEOTIHUACAN, Mexico, April 24 (Reuters) - A Mexican archeologist hunting for a royal tomb in a deep, dark tunnel beneath a towering pre-Aztec pyramid has made a discovery that may have brought him a step closer: liquid mercury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the bowels of Teotihuacan, a mysterious ancient city that was once the largest in the Americas, Sergio Gomez this month found "large quantities" of the silvery metal in a chamber at the end of a sacred tunnel sealed for nearly 1,800 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's something that completely surprised us," Gomez said at the entrance to the tunnel below Teotihuacan's Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent, about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Mexico City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some archeologists believe the toxic element could herald what would be the first ruler's tomb ever found in Teotihuacan, a contemporary of several ancient Maya cities, but so shrouded in mystery that its inhabitants still have no name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Unsure why the mercury was put there, Gomez says the metal may have been used to symbolize an underworld river or lake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Previously uncovered in small amounts at a few Maya sites much further south, it had never been found in Teotihuacan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Difficult to mine and prized for its reflective properties, mercury was rare in ancient Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Archaeologists believe may have lent it a supernatural significance for ritual ends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Deeper into the complex comprising three chambers, Gomez expects to find the elusive last resting place of a king.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Teotihuacan, or "abode of the gods" in the Aztec language of Nahuatl, was distinct from the Mayan civilization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Its inhabitants left behind no written record, abandoning the city long before the Aztecs came to power in the 14th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Spaniards dug at Teotihuacan in the 1670s, but rigorous scientific excavation of the site did not begin until the 1950s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gomez's six-year slog in the tunnel has already yielded tens of thousands of artifacts including stone sculptures, fine jewelry and giant seashells leading to the three chambers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The painstaking excavation has slowed due to extreme humidity, mud, and now, the need for protective gear to avoid mercury poisoning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>George Cowgill, a U.S. archeologist who has spent more than four decades excavating Teotihuacan, says the mercury find increases the odds of finding a tomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mexican archeologist Linda Manzanilla believes that at its peak, the city was ruled not by a single king, but a council of four lords, and that Gomez may find the remains of one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>To bolster her argument, she cites the absence of a single palace or the presence of kings in any of the city's many murals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The excavation of the chambers should be finished by October, Gomez said, with an announcement of findings by the end of 2015.</td></tr>
