<h3>CarGo hits 3-run HR in 9th, Rockies top Dodgers to stop skid (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies ended their 11-game losing streak in dramatic fashion, thanks to a guy they've always relied on to come through in clutch situations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Carlos Gonzalez hit a three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning, and Colorado sloshed its way to a 5-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday night following a rare rain delay at Chavez Ravine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''I really can't put it into words how hard and difficult it's been for the club and for myself,'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It's one of those stretches that you really want to get over with, and it finally happened tonight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It took longer than what we expected, with all the rain, but we kept grinding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That shows a lot of respect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Rockies were rained out three times during their most recent homestand, including a game with the Dodgers last Saturday that was rescheduled for June 2 at Coors Field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''That cloud has been following us everywhere we go,'' Gonzalez said with a laugh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''We've had to battle against other teams and weather conditions and rain delays, so it's hard to keep your body in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>To stay in the clubhouse for an hour and a half, I'm sure it affects the other team, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Wilin Rosario also went deep for the last-place Rockies in the opener of a four-game series between the top and bottom teams in the NL West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Play was halted for 85 minutes during the sixth inning at a ballpark that hasn't had a weather postponement in 15 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dodgers rookie Yimi Garcia (2-1), who has been filling in as closer with Kenley Jansen on the disabled list, gave up a leadoff single to Nick Hundley in the ninth and a one-out single by Drew Stubbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Charlie Blackmon was called out on strikes before Gonzalez drove a 2-1 pitch halfway up the right-field pavilion for his third homer of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''I was watching Garcia warming up and he was throwing a lot of fastballs, so I was ready to swing at a good fastball,'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was Garcia's third blown save in four chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''We kind of felt like it was Yimi's inning,'' Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''We were kind of out of righties, for the most part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We're kind of at that spot where we felt like Yimi was our guy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He's had two outings that didn't go his way, but he's a young guy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rafael Betancourt (1-1) pitched a perfect eighth and John Axford worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his fourth save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Brett Anderson tossed 5 1-3 solid innings for Los Angeles, allowing two runs with eight strikeouts on a chilly night at Dodger Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The game-time temperature was 59 degrees and the teams played through showers, thunder and lightning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Adrian Gonzalez gave Los Angeles the lead in the first with a two-run double that put him within two RBIs of 1,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Anderson had a run-scoring double in the second for his second career RBI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Dodgers were ahead 4-1 when play was stopped in the sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The game resumed at 10:23 p.m., and Rosario hit a routine grounder that four-time Gold Glove shortstop Jimmy Rollins booted on the freshly manicured infield for an error that allowed Carlos Gonzalez to score.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Chad Bettis threw 106 pitches over five innings for the Rockies after getting recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>For the second straight night, Rockies bench coach Tom Runnells ran the team following manager Walt Weiss' emergency appendectomy Wednesday while the club was playing in Anaheim against the Angels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Weiss was released from the hospital Thursday and returned to the team hotel in Los Angeles with head athletic trainer Keith Dugger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Rockies: Rookie reliever Brooks Brown was placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to May 4, with inflammation in his shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Dodgers: RHP Pedro Baez was placed on the 15-day DL because of a strained pectoral muscle and was replaced on the roster by LHP Daniel Coulombe, who was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The last weather postponement at Chavez Ravine was on April 17, 2000, when the Houston Astros were in town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>There have been 17 rainouts since the ballpark opened in 1962.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Rockies: RHP Eddie Butler (2-3) will make his seventh start of the season and third against the Dodgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He allowed two runs against them in each of the first two outings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Dodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (1-2) makes his fifth attempt at his 100th regular-season win against the team he no-hit last June.</td></tr>
