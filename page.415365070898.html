<h3>Ferguson city manager resigns after scathing Justice Department report reveals sweeping racial bias</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This evening, the Ferguson City Council unanimously voted on a resolution to part ways with City Manager John Shaw effective immediately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shaw, 39, was among several individuals heavily criticized in the scathing Justice Department report issued last Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Shaw had held the position in the St. Louis suburb since 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Justice Department launched an investigation into Ferguson's police department and municipal court after the August 9 shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A news release from the city said the Council had reached a 'mutual separation agreement' with Shaw, the city's chief executive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The statement also said a nationwide search for Shaw's replacement would begin immediately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'I believe that the city of Ferguson has the resolve to overcome the challenges it faces in the coming months and emerge as a stronger community for it,' Shaw, 39, said in a statement included in the release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Since Brown's death seven months ago, Mayor James Knowles has been the public face and voice of Ferguson's city government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Shaw held the legal power to make personnel and policy changes in the police department - not Knowles, a part-time officeholder who earns less than $5,000 annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Shaw has been Ferguson's city manager for eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He had previously worked as city clerk and assistant to the city administrator in Shrewsbury, another town in St. Louis County.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Online biographies indicate that he grew up in north St. Louis County and lived in Ferguson before working for the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I believe that the city of Ferguson has the resolve to overcome the challenges it faces in the coming months and emerge as a stronger community for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He was honored in 2013 as a distinguished alumnus of a public policy administration program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, which is located near Ferguson, and was listed as an adviser for the university's student group for aspiring city managers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Shaw has not spoken publicly about the shooting, protests, grand jury inquiry or Justice Department investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He stood silently beside two City Council members at Knowles' Wednesday news conference responding to the Justice Department report and declined, through a city spokesman, a subsequent Associated Press interview request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He was not at Tuesday's meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Justice Department report repeatedly cited Shaw's role in encouraging his police force to aggressively ticket motorists as a means to generate revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And when Jackson told Shaw in January 2013 that municipal court revenue had exceeded $2million the previous year, the city manager was similarly excited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'Awesome!' he said, according to the federal inquiry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But in a statement issued after the announcement of his departure, Shaw said his office 'never instructed the police department to target African Americans, nor falsify charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false,' Shaw said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Shaw's resignation comes a day after Ferguson Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer stepped down to help the divided city 'begin its healing process' and to promote public confidence in the court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Last Thursday, two Ferguson Police Department commanders also quit after racist emails were released during the DOJ's investigation into the police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Sgt. William Mudd and Capt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Rick Henke resigned Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty was fired Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>'This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized,' Holder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'A community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the DOJ, Reuters reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury and the Justice Department both declined to bring charges in the Michael Brown shooting against Officer Darren Wilson, who left the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Justice Department report said Wilson acted in self-defense when he shot Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But the agency said in its report last week that Ferguson's police and court systems functioned as a money-making enterprise that heightened tensions among residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The DOJ report cited cases of racial profiling and bigotry by the predominantly white police force in the mostly black St. Louis suburb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Brown's shooting prompted protests in the St. Louis area and across the nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>African-Americans also made up most of incidents in which officers used force and all incidents where police dogs bit citizens.</td></tr>
