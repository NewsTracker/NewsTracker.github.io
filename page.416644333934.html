<h3>No cut for stay-at-home mums: Morrison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Social Services Minister Scott Morrison has dismissed reports the federal government plans to cut payments to stay-at-home parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While childcare subsidies focused on supporting working parents, those who looked after children at home got support through other measures, Mr Morrison said in response to a report that non-working parents would no longer be able to claim the childcare rebate or benefit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"In my experience all mums work, and work very hard," he tweeted on Friday, adding the government had no plans to introduce new measures reducing payments to stay-at-home parents.</td></tr>
