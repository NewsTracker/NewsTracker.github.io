<h3>S. Africa inflation drops to four-year low</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The rate was 0.5 percentage points down on January's figure and was the lowest since March 2011, due in part to low oil prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The drop was in line with economists' predictions as declining fuel prices continued to filter through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the rate is expected to start rising "rapidly" propelled by "the weaker rand dollar exchange rate, rising oil prices and higher food prices stemming from a poor maize crop," according to South Africa's Nedbank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The February figure falls within the central bank's annual average inflation rate forecast for this year of between three and six percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nedbank forecast that inflation would rise to near six percent by the end of the year.</td></tr>
