<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In Kyiv, EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn focussed instead on the need for parties involved in the conflict to respect the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On the ground, one group of Ukrainian troops could hardly contain their relief at getting out alive from the strategic town of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Back on government-held territory, they smiled and took photographs of each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Thousands of weary and demoralised government soldiers withdrew from Debaltseve on Wednesday in one of the worst defeats suffered by Kyiv in 10 months of fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Debaltseve, suggesting they may now observe it, having captured the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Western countries say Russia is behind the rebel advance, deploying thousands of troops with advanced weaponry into eastern Ukraine to fight on the separatists' behalf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Moscow denies this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With fighting continuing in places, the international leaders behind the latest Minsk accord have agreed to make a new attempt to enforce the ceasefire.</td></tr>
