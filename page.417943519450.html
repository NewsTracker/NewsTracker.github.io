<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's an awesome feeling to win again here," Rosberg said on the podium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The start made the race. It was a great start and I managed to defend in the first couple of corners. I was really happy with the car and to see the gap open up to Lewis."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rosberg managed to get past pole-sitter Hamilton at the first turn but the safety car came out after Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso collided on turn two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Alonso's McLaren mounted Raikkonen's Ferrari as both slid along a crash barrier but both drivers climbed out unhurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Alonso, starting on the last row alongside teammate Jenson Button after grid penalties, went to the medical centre to be checked before giving the all clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'm OK. It was obviously quite scary," Alonso said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Kimi had a lot of wheel spin out of turn two. We were overtaking him and he lost the car on the left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I was on the left. I could not see anything. I looked in the mirror and saw a car under my car. I jumped quickly to see he was OK. I saw he was so was happy."</td></tr>
