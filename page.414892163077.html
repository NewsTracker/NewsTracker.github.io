<tr><td>10</td><td>Behind her, a gaping hole left by a shell strike revealed the shattered remains of an apartment basement, much like the one in which she took refuge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Debaltseve's ordeal had been expected to end with the cease-fire agreement forged last week by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine says rebel attacks continuing despite ceasefire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KYIV, Ukraine -- The Ukrainian government and the separatist rebels blamed each other Friday for violating a fragile ceasefire dozens of times, sparking fears of wider hostilities in war-torn eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>The rebels, meanwhile, claimed that Ukrainian forces had violated the ceasefire more than 20 times Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The government claims, which followed the rebel seizure of the key rail hub of Debaltseve, raised the question of whether weeks of high-level diplomacy aimed at producing a ceasefire and a peace plan had simply allowed the rebels to redouble efforts to grab more territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The village of Kurakhovo, west of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, was hit by Grad rockets and the village of Berdyansk, near the key port city of Mariupol, was hit overnight by artillery and mortar fire, Lt. Col.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>"That doesn't mean this doesn't exist," he said, underscoring the need for the ceasefire to take hold and halt the risk of escalation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Vladislav Seleznyev, a spokesman for Ukraine's military general staff, said two soldiers had been killed in the past day and 110 were being held prisoner by the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both sides were supposed to begin drawing back heavy weapons from the front lines Tuesday, but international monitors say they have seen no signs of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Concerns are rising that the rebels are still gunning to take Mariupol, a government-held city on the Sea of Azov that could allow them to create a land bridge between Russia and Crimea, which Russia annexed last March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Crimea has no physical link to Russian territory now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Thursday, the rebels celebrated their victory over Ukrainian forces in Debaltseve, a key transport hub linking the two largest rebel strongholds in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rebel fighters roamed the town's debris-littered streets, laughing, hugging and posing for photos, although the death of one fighter when his vehicle hit a land mine was a sharp reminder of the dangers that still lurked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ukrainian soldiers who made it out of Debaltseve alive on Thursday described weeks of harrowing rebel shelling, followed by a chaotic, hasty retreat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ukrainian officials said 13 soldiers had been killed and 157 wounded in the fighting, but the shell-shocked soldiers themselves spoke of many more casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Starting at night, they would fire at us just to stop us from sleeping. They did this all night," a Ukrainian soldier named Andrei said after fleeing Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Then in the morning, they would attack, wave after wave."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The war in eastern Ukraine has killed more than 5,600 people and forced over a million to flee their homes since fighting began in April, a month after Russia annexed Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Russia denies arming the rebels or supplying fighters, but Western nations and NATO point to satellite pictures of Russian military equipment in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In Kyiv, nationalists criticized the government for allowing Debaltseve to fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Friday was a key anniversary for the months of anti-government protests in 2013-14 that brought down Ukraine's previous, Kremlin-friendly government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A year ago, sniper fire tore through crowds of protesters on Kyiv's main square, killing more than 50 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Dozens more died in earlier clashes with police or were beaten to death under mysterious circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>On Friday evening, President Petro Poroshenko was to be among those honouring them at a memorial ceremony in Kyiv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Hollande and Merkel, who oversaw marathon peace talks last week between the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, warned Friday that more EU sanctions could be levelled if the peace accords to stabilize Ukraine are not respected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Hollande said at a joint press conference that "every country that doesn't keep its word" risks sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In Britain, a parliamentary report published Friday accused the British government and European diplomats of "sleepwalking" into the Ukraine crisis, saying there was a "catastrophic misreading" of the mood in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The House of Lords' EU Committee said foreign ministries in Britain and other European countries were poorly equipped to draw up an "authoritative response" to the crisis partly because they lack expertise on Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The report said the 28-nation European Union had been too optimistic about Russia's democratic development, and as a result Europe failed to realize the depth of Russian hostility when the EU opened talks with Ukraine in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Elaine Ganley in Paris and Sylvia Hui in London contributed to this report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Russia-backed rebels ride on an armored vehicle in Debaltseve, Ukraine, Friday, Feb. 20, 2015.</td></tr>
