<h3>Ukraine says rebel attacks continue despite cease-fire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After weeks of relentless fighting, the embattled Ukrainian rail hub of Debaltseve fell Wednesday to Russia-backed separatists, who hoisted a flag in triumph over the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>DEBALTSEVE, Ukraine (AP) - Almost every building was gravely damaged, nearly every window smashed in this Ukrainian town left unrecognizable by months of relentless shelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Children played in the rubble where their homes once stood, while neighbors boiled water in open fires as temperatures dipped below freezing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Two days after government forces fled Debaltseve in disarray, leaving the Russian-backed separatists in total control of the strategic town, all was quiet Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Residents who could not or refused to flee came blinking out of makeshift shelters to soak up the rare winter sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Across town, Cossack fighters rolled jubilantly away on commandeered trucks, tanks and armored vehicles, having secured another decisive victory for the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yevgeniya Fomichova, whose gutted apartment was just three blocks away from a Ukrainian military encampment, said she and more than a dozen neighbors cowered in basements for seven months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The nightly terror of shelling worsened in January as separatists massively intensified their onslaught.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"For a month we've had no bread and water," the 60-year-old said, adding that it had been weeks since she and her neighbors had bathed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Behind her, a gaping hole left by a shell strike revealed the shattered remains of an apartment basement, much like the one in which she took refuge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Debaltseve's ordeal had been expected to end with the cease-fire agreement forged last week by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Instead, the attacks intensified as the rebels moved to capture a town deemed strategically important for its role as a railway hub linking the two largest separatist-held cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Reports of violations of the truce continued Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A Ukrainian military spokesman said separatists fired on government positions nearly 50 times in the preceding 24 hours, while the rebels claimed that Ukrainian forces had violated the cease-fire 20 times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The village of Kurakhovo, west of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, was hit by Grad rockets and the village of Berdyansk, near the key port city of Mariupol, was hit overnight by artillery and mortar fire, said Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Anatoliy Stelmakh, a Ukrainian military spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In Washington, Vice President Joe Biden condemned the rebel offensive in Debaltseve in a phone call with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, saying the separatists were directly supported by Russian troops in "blatant violation" of peace agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A White House statement said the leaders also discussed ways the cease-fire deal can be monitored and the withdrawal of heavy weapons ensured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At a crossroads along the highway to Debaltseve, Cossacks and other rebel fighters were shipping out Friday, taking captured Ukrainian armored vehicles and trucks with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On the road out of town, sappers detonated anti-tank mines left behind by the retreating Ukrainian troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cossacks, who spearheaded imperial Russia's expansion and helped guard its far-flung outposts, trace their historic roots to both Ukraine and southern Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They faced persecution under Bolshevik rule but resurfaced after the 1991 Soviet collapse and are now recognized in Russia as an ethnic group who consider themselves descendants of the czarist-era horsemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Meanwhile, in Kiev, thousands gathered to mark the anniversary of the 2014 sniper shootings that killed more than 50 people, the bloodiest day of the monthslong protests that led to the ouster of Ukraine's Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A month later, armed separatists began seizing buildings in the mainland east, sparking the war with government troops.</td></tr>
