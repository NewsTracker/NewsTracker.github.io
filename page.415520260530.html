<h3>No Palestinian state while I am PM, says faltering Netanyahu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In an election eve about-face, Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed there will never be a Palestinian state as long as he is prime minister, contradicting a previous commitment in a bid to woo wavering right-wing voters back to his Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He accused the centrist Zionist Union of laying the groundwork for a settlement freeze in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and warned that the Zionist Union's leaders, Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, would work with the international community to maintain Israel's borders along the pre-1967 lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Netanyahu made his comments - which are inconsistent with his Bar-Ilan University speech in June 2009, in which he committed to a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine - to the NRG website owned by one of his key financial and media backers, the US casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think that anyone who moves to establish a Palestinian state and evacuate territory gives territory away to radical Islamist attacks against Israel," Mr Netanyahu told NRG.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The Left has buried its head in the sand time after time and ignores this, but we are realistic and understand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a separate statement on a campaign tour of the settlement of Har Homa in East Jerusalem, he vowed to continue to build settlement homes so Palestine would never be able to establish a capital in the city's east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I won't let that happen. My friends and I in Likud will preserve the unity of Jerusalem," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We will continue to build in Jerusalem, we will add thousands of housing units, and in the face of all the [international] pressure, we will persist and continue to develop our eternal capital," the New York Times reported him saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Settlements are considered illegal under international law - a point Israel does not accept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Netanyahu has done everything possible to bury the two-state solution," Palestine Liberation Organisation committee member Saeb Erekat said, adding that the Israeli prime minister's latest statement counted on "full impunity from the international community".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Although the final polls give the Zionist Union a four to six-seat lead over Likud, experts warn the polls can be significantly inaccurate and say whichever party wins the most votes will be forced to form a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The last opinion polls before the March 17 election were published on Friday - they estimate the Zionist Union would win between 24 and 26 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, compared to 20 to 22 seats for Mr Netanyahu's Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>To form government, either the Zionist Union or Likud would need a coalition of at least 61 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since its first election in 1949, no party has been able to form government outright in Israel, and coalition negotiations often go on for weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In all previous elections we had considerable differences between the predictions of the public opinion polls and [the results]," said Professor Avraham Diskin, a political scientist from Jerusalem's Hebrew University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Yesh Atid [the party led by former TV presenter Yair Lapid] didn't get more than 10 or 11 seats in the public opinion polls [before the last general election in 2013] and finally got . . . 19 seats."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In 2009 - the election in which Mr Netanyahu took the prime ministership for a second time - the centrist Kadima party won the most seats but was unable to form a coalition and in the end, Mr Netanyahu took power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Back then, the Kadima party was headed by Tzipi Livni, who was justice minister in the last government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She is now head of the HaTnuah Party that is in coalition with the Labour Party to form the Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Analysts say it is possible the same scenario could play out in this election - the centre-left coalition may win the most seats, but Mr Netanyahu's Likud may be able to form a coalition with the centrist Kulanu party, headed by former Likud minister Moshe Kahlon, and other parties to the right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Kulanu is polling at around 9 to 10 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If Mr Herzog and Ms Livni could join with Mr Kahlon, Yesh Atid and the ultra-Orthodox parties who are polling a combined 13 seats, they may be able to form government, but analysts are warning this scenario is unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Joint List - a combination of several smaller Arab parties forced to form a coalition when the threshold for election was raised from two per cent to 3.25 per cent - has been this election's biggest surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They are polling at around 13 seats and would form the third force in Israeli politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mr Herzog says he will offer the Joint List a ministry but will not invite them into his coalition, so for the first time in Israel's history, its opposition may be headed by a Palestinian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Many Israeli voters remained undecided on the morning of the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>One voter - Michal Kesten Keidar, 38 - has a powerful message for those wavering in the ballot box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I urge people to vote for any one who is committed to avoiding the next war," she told Fairfax Media.</td></tr>

<h3>In Intense Desert Training, A Dozen Women Fight For Place On Front Lines</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the dry and craggy hills of California's Mojave Desert, Capt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ray Kaster tries to shout over the din of a machine gun to be heard by Alpha Company, the unit of Marines he's working with during a month of rigorous instruction at Twentynine Palms training center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As part of a larger training session, the Marines are testing whether women have what it takes to serve in ground combat: armor, artillery and infantry units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But after the first week, nearly half of the women in the infantry unit already have dropped out - a much higher dropout rate than for their male counterparts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>About a dozen women remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Only one of the women dropped out while in the Mojave Desert; the rest dropped out because of injuries - mostly hip and leg fractures - that they received at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina while getting ready for the live-fire event in the desert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Male and female Marines hike up to a range at Twentynine Palms, a training base in the Mojave Desert, to participate in a live-fire exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At Camp Lejeune, the women had to perform exercises that in the past were only performed by men, from lifting ammunition cans and machine guns and carrying fellow Marines, to simulating the evacuation of a wounded comrade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The load obviously is something the majority of them are not used to," Kaster says, adding that it didn't surprise him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We're all different. And that's one of the things we're here to do, to show what are those differences, and do they affect the readiness, what toll on the readiness of the infantry small unit does that have."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Combat Training: Can Female Marines Get The Job Done?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Readiness means a unit is trained and equipped for the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The only woman taking part in the mock infantry attack at Twentynine Palms, Sgt. Kelly Brown, agrees that the focus must be on a unit's ability to defeat an enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If females do want to do it ... there has to be standards put in place to ensure that combat effectiveness is not going to be altered for the infantry," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When the mock attack is over, Brown pulls off her gear, checks her weapon and gets ready for the next round of training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Whether women like Kelly Brown get to serve in ground combat won't be determined until later next year, when the Marine Corps looks at all the data from these training exercises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Depending on the results, the generals could recommend that some jobs, including infantry, stay closed to women.</td></tr>
