<h3>Toby Alderweireld says Southampton need to win to keep European dreams alive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A summer of despair at St Mary's has been followed by a quite remarkable season, leaving Saints sixth in the standings with just nine matches remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Last weekend's 1-1 draw at Chelsea boosted their hopes of European qualification - a match in which Alderweireld performed fantastically on his return from a hamstring injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was a positive display after a frustrating time of late and the Belgium international knows Saints have to follow it up with a win at home to Burnley on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'It was great after two months seeing from the sidelines to play again,' Alderweireld said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'With a bit of luck, a good defence and a great goalkeeper we got a point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'It's important we don't look too far in the future because it won't help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>We can be happy with the point at Chelsea, but if we lose on Saturday what does it mean?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'We want to achieve something good, something special this season, so we have to win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That's game by game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>We can't play a different game on Saturday, it's Burnley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'We really want to achieve something very special for Southampton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>We have nine games, nine finals; we have very tough games left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Burnley arrive at St Mary's in the relegation zone yet buoyed by last weekend's win against champions Manchester City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sean Dyche's men also got the better of Saints when they met earlier in the campaign and Alderweireld is eyeing revenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'It's going to be difficult because they are in a good mood, they have had good performances in the last few weeks so they have confidence,' he told Southampton's official YouTube channel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'But at home, we need to win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>We can put the pressure on us because of the season we have had, we have to do that, especially at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'We have to be patient, show good quality on the ball and look out for the counter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'In the last game we deserved to win I think.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>We had the better chances and they had none really.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'We had the throw-in and then they scored, it was very unlucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>We could have won there so we want to get a little revenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'They have a lot of good players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>That's the Premier League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>When you're not 100 per cent, anyone can beat you, that's what people like about the Premier League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>'We have to be 100 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They are in a good mood so we have to be at our best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'I don't think this group is over confident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>PLAY NOW TO WIN with Coral...</td></tr>
