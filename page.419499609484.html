<h3>Hillary Clinton's slide bolsters interest in run by Joe Biden</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>US Vice-President Joe Biden speaks in Denver, Colorado, last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Washington: As Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign struggles with sliding poll numbers, Vice-President Joe Biden's exploration of a presidential candidacy is taking on a new seriousness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Biden has been in contact with donors who could help finance a campaign, eyeing major contributors to President Barack Obama and pillars of his own fundraising network: trial lawyers, Jewish leaders and Greek-Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At the same time, some Democrats supporting Ms Clinton have quietly signalled that they would re-evaluate their support if Mr Biden joined the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>For example, Tom Daschle, an influential former Senate Democratic leader who has given the maximum amount allowable to Ms Clinton's campaign, has indicated that he would reassess his position if Mr Biden ran, according to people who have been in contact with him in recent days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In addition, a "Draft Biden" group has started to build an infrastructure to use if the Vice-President enters the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After initially focusing on raising money for their effort, they have begun to hire field organisers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Biden's supporters have, in private conversations, signalled that if he does enter the race he will portray himself as the rightful heir to Mr Obama's legacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They also argue that given the unpredictability of a campaign season in which both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have won a following, it is folly to dismiss Mr Biden's chances out of hand.</td></tr>
