<h3>No ill feelings toward Ferguson: Raiders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Canberra recruit Frank-Paul Nu'uausala says Sydney Roosters halfback and former NRL teammate Mitchell Pearce has been sending him "smartarse" messages threatening to bash him when the two sides clash at Allianz Stadium on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Most eyes will be on how the Raiders approach their first clash against former bad boy Blake Ferguson but Nu'uausala will also be dealing with his own niggling banter from ex-teammates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nu'uausala joined the Raiders late last year after being released by the Roosters at the end of his eighth season with the club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When asked if he had received any banter from his former teammates, who he won a NRL premiership alongside in 2013, Nu'uausala didn't hold back from dobbing in his good mate and Roosters halfback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Yeah there's been a bit of banter, especially from Mitchell Pearce," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He said he's going to bash me, and I say fair enough - one for one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nu'uausala then laughed at a comment from one journalist who said it was a bit rich for a halfback to threaten a prop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He's a bit of a smartarse but that comes with being a halfback," Nu'uausala said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Nah he's alright, me and Mitchy have a good relationship. We've played together since we were 18."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While Nu'uausala might still hold strong connections with his old club, the same can't be said for Ferguson and the Raiders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ferguson spectacularly went AWOL from the Raiders in 2013 after a string of off-field indiscretions, leaving the club no choice but to sack the rising star just after he had played in a NSW State of Origin side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After a year of exile in 2014, Sunday will be the first time Ferguson faces his old club and comes just a week after starring in the Roosters' win over Penrith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He'll be marked at centre by new Canberra skipper Jarrod Croker, whose loyalty and gratitude to the club is a stark contrast to the trainwreck Ferguson left it in at the end of 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Yet Croker on Friday insisted he holds no grudges when it comes to Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Blake's put it behind him and we've put it behind us. It's good to see Fergo back where he belongs - on the football field," Croker said.</td></tr>
