<h3>Leader of Mexico's Zetas cartel held</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday in the city of Monterrey in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He is believed to have run the Zetas cartel since the capture of his brother, Miguel Angel, in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The arrest comes days after Mexican police captured another suspected drug lord, Servando "La Tuta" Gomez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Servando Gomez was the leader of the Knights Templar cartel in Michoacan state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Omar Trevino Morales, known as Z-42 and believed to be 40 or 41 years old, is wanted in the US and Mexico on charges of drug trafficking, kidnap and murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Mexican government had a 30m peso ( 1.3m; $2m) reward for his capture while the US offered a $5m ( 3.2m) reward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mexican media, citing officials, said he had been seized in the Monterrey suburb of San Pedro Garza Garcia in a joint operation by the army and the federal police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was arrested in a luxury home without a shot being fired, local media said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Neighbours told El Universal newspaper the house had been bought about six months ago by a family "which kept themselves to themselves and did not mingle with other neighbours".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He has been transferred under heavy security to Mexico City and paraded before television cameras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>National Security Commission Director Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia said intelligence gatherings since the capture of Omar Trevino's brother led to his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"For the past few years, he's been one of the country's most-wanted delinquents, with an extremely violent profile," said Mr Rubido.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The capture of not just one - but two - drugs kingpins in less than a week is a coup for the Mexican government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It has come in for criticism in recent months for failing to quell the violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The government will, of course, be proud of its achievements and the cartel will be weakened by this latest arrest, but this is not the end of "Los Zetas".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>With operations across several states and a reputation for being one of the most violent drugs cartels in the country, experts say that the way it is structured means it will bounce back and will still represent a formidable challenge to security in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mike Vigil, a retired chief of international operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, told the AFP news agency that the arrest meant that the last of the "solid leaders within the Zetas is gone".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"With this I think that the Zetas are going to have a very large void in terms of leadership. The big problem here, though, is that if the Zetas splinter into other organisations, then that can lead to violence in terms of the internal competition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Zetas were created in the 1990s as the enforcement arm of another powerful criminal gang, the Gulf Cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When they split from their former Gulf cartel allies, a violent turf war ensued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Among the notorious crimes attributed to the cartel are the 2011 arson attack on a Monterrey casino in which 52 people died and the torture and murder in 2010 of 72 Central American migrants as punishment for their refusal to act as drugs mules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The cartel was weakened by the killing of former leader Heriberto Lazcano in 2012 and the capture of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The cartel is most active in the north-eastern states on the border with the United States, including Coahuila, Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>With the Gulf cartel losing ground, the Zetas are believed to have had less need for violence and instead concentrated more on extortion and drug trafficking.</td></tr>

<h3>Official: Mexico arrests Zetas leader Omar Trevino Morales</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A simultaneous raid on another street in the same suburb reaped Carlos Arturo Jimenez Encinas, allegedly Trevino's finance chief, Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tomas Zeron, the attorney general's criminal investigations chief, called Trevino "one of the most dangerous and bloodthirsty criminals in Mexico" and said he faced at least 11 criminal counts including drug trafficking, organized crime, kidnapping and oil theft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He also said Trevino faced a pending extradition request from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Mexican government had offered a 30 million peso ($2 million) reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration offered a $5 million reward for his capture, saying he was wanted for drug trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said in a statement, "The Zetas represent the worst in global organized crime: violence, intimidation, corruption, and brutal killings. Today's arrest strikes at the heart of the leadership structure of the Zetas and should serve as yet another warning that no criminal is immune from arrest and prosecution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after Mexican marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano "El Lazca."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rubido said Omar, 38, took over leadership of the Zetas after his brother's arrest and immediately became a target of their investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The hunt for him caught a break in February when authorities observed someone matching Trevino's description at one of the houses around Monterrey where Jimenez Encinas, the alleged finance chief, was known to hold meetings, Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Surveillance was increased until Trevino's identity was confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Authorities discovered he was moving with a smaller than usual security detail to draw less attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Just after 3 a.m. Wednesday, federal police and soldiers moved on both locations, Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Four additional men were also arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>All six were walked across the tarmac from a military plane at Mexico City's airport and loaded into armored personnel carriers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Zetas was originally a gang formed by deserters from an elite army unit and left a trail of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But much of the violence along Mexico's northeast border now is due to internal battles among Gulf cartel factions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The truth is that this is a group that has been fragmented," Javier Oliva, an expert on the drug war at Mexico's National Autonomous University, said of the Zetas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Their influence is now more on a local level, in townships" rather than the broad, multi-state trafficking corridor they once controlled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But Oliva said that doesn't mean the Zetas and their internal fight to determine a replacement for Trevino Morales won't turn bloody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said gunmen or second-tier operators who were active under Trevino Morales may now seek to replace him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The capture of Omar Trevino Morales follows Friday's arrest of another big cartel leader, Servando Gomez, known as "La Tuta."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Gomez allegedly led the Knights Templar, a pseudo-religious drug gang that built up control of many sectors of the economy in the western state of Michoacan before it was weakened by an uprising of citizen vigilante groups and a stepped-up federal security campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The two arrests provided much-needed good news for the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has been battered by a series of scandals in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The government needed to show that some of its policies were successful," said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"And in this case, without doubt the strategy against the drug cartels is going well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Like Servando Gomez, Omar Trevino Morales was captured without any shots being fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Trevino Morales brothers took proceeds from their U.S. drug sales and laundered them by purchasing American quarter horses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>That scheme was led by Jose Trevino Morales, a third brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A jury in Texas found Morales guilty in May of investing $16 million of drug money in the buying, training and racing of horses across the Southwest United States.</td></tr>
