<h3>Terror Plot on Paris Church Thwarted After Extremist Accidentally Shoots Himself</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(PARIS) - An Islamic extremist with an arsenal of loaded guns was only prevented from opening fire on Sunday morning churchgoers because he accidentally shot himself, French officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 24-year-old computer science student, who was also suspected in the death of a young woman whose body was found on Sunday just ahead of his arrest, had been flagged as a risk last year and earlier this year but there was no specific reason to open a judicial investigation, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A French security official, who was not authorized to publicly release details, said the suspect - an Algerian who had lived in France for several years - was arrested in Paris Sunday after he apparently shot himself by accident and called for an ambulance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was waiting outside for first aid when police arrived at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They discovered a blood trail leading to his car, which contained loaded guns and notes about potential targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Documents were also found and they prove, without any ambiguity, that the individual was preparing an imminent attack, in all probability, against one or two churches," Cazeneuve said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the man's apartment, in southeastern Paris, more weapons were found as well as Islamic extremist material, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There was no immediate evidence that the suspect had direct ties to any organized groups, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Aurelie Chatelain, a 32-year-old Frenchwoman visiting Paris for a training session for her work, was found shot to death on Sunday morning in her car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The security official said Chatelain appeared to have been killed at random and ballistics evidence linked her death to the suspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The terrorists target France to divide us" said Prime Minister Manuel Valls at a news conference Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>France has been on edge since the Jan. 7-9 attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket left 20 people dead, including the three gunmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In that case, at least two of the gunmen had been flagged to French intelligence - and the third had been recently released from prison after serving a sentence involving his ties to Islamic extremists - but surveillance was called off months before the attack.</td></tr>
