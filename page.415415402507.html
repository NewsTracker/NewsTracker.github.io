<h3>Obama banters with Kimmel, reflects on Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After enduring the routine - in which celebrities read hostile Twitter comments about themselves - Obama told Kimmel, "You should see what the Senate says about me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The president also joked about the perks and restrictions he faces, revealing that he's not allowed to use cellphones that have recorders in them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(Hence his ever-present BlackBerry.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also noted that he can visit the dentist in the White House basement but doesn't text and can't drive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kimmel asked if that was because you have to have a birth certificate to get a driver's license.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Obama - whom Kimmel introduced as the "first Kenyan-born Muslim Socialist ever elected president" - deadpanned that Kenyans "drive on the other side" of the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With Sean Penn waiting in the wings, Obama said he was quite familiar with Penn's 1982 coming-of-age comedy "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I lived it," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I didn't just see it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kimmel spared the president from questions about the latest controversy involving the Secret Service - although Kimmel's security guard and sidekick, Guillermo Rodriguez, dressed in a full Secret Service getup of dark suit and sunglasses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The glasses, Kimmel joked, were simply hiding a hangover: "Secret cerveza."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Obama's appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" fulfilled a commitment the White House made after he had to postpone an appearance last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>During a more subdued segment, Obama reflected on Wednesday night's shooting of two police officers in racially tense Ferguson, Missouri, just days after he had delivered a speech on racial healing in Selma, Alabama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest, but there was no excuse for criminal acts," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Whoever fired those shots should not detract from the issue - they are criminals, they need to be arrested. And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides - law enforcement, who have a terrifically tough job, and people who understandably don't want to be stopped and harassed just because of their race - that they are able to work together to come up with some good answers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After the "Kimmel" taping, Obama attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at the Santa Monica home of Chris Silbermann, president of ICM Partners, one of the top talent agencies in Hollywood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The event was closed to the press, but a Democratic official said the event attracted about 25 people who each paid up to $33,400.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Friday, Obama is flying to Phoenix to hold a roundtable event on veterans' health care.</td></tr>
