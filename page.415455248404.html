<h3>Chiefs topple Stormers in Super Rugby, champs NSW lose</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The two-time champion Chiefs of New Zealand recovered from an early try to Stormers wing Kobus van Wyk to score three of their own in a 28-19 win away at Newlands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Flyhalf Aaron Cruden, wing James Lowe and flanker Sam Cane went over, lifting the Hamilton-based Chiefs from 10-3 and 16-13 down to a comfortable and significant win in Cape Town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Stormers' first loss of the season left just the Wellington-based Hurricanes as the only unbeaten team after five rounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, ACT Brumbies now lead the standings in place of the Stormers after a five-try, 29-0 rout of the Queensland Reds in their Australian derby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>ACT has played one game more than the Hurricanes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Also Saturday, All Blacks flyhalf Dan Carter returned from a monthlong injury layoff to kick four conversions and two penalties in the Crusaders' 34-6 win over South Africa's Lions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Defending champion New South Wales Waratahs lost to New Zealand's Highlanders 26-19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the final game of the round, the Sharks had too much for the Cheetahs in an all-South African meeting, also scoring five tries in a 27-10 win, with Springboks flanker Marcell Coetzee rumbling over for two of those tries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For the Stormers, Van Wyk sliced through in the first half, but the home team couldn't convert its powerful scrum into lasting dominance on the scoreboard against the clever Chiefs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>All Black Cruden slipped in for a first-half try and added 13 points with the boot as the Chiefs were far sharper after the early Stormers surge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Carter had been sidelined since the opening round of the season when he suffered a leg injury in the Christchurch-based Crusaders' 20-10 loss to the Melbourne Rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Playing at center against the Lions, he converted tries by scrumhalf Andy Ellis, replacement Kieron Fonotia and returning All Blacks backrower Kieran Read, and a penalty try awarded for a scrum infringement in the 55th minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The slow-starting Crusaders, record seven-time Super Rugby winners, moved up to ninth and within sight of the playoffs with just their second win this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Dunedin-based Highlanders scored three tries in an eight-minute period on either side of halftime to beat last year's winner New South Wales of Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Winger Waisake Naholo outflanked the defense in the 38th minute to give the Highlanders a 14-12 halftime lead after trailing for much of the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Fullback Ben Smith and winger Patrick Osborne crossed in the third and sixth minutes of the second half to extend the lead, and the Highlanders held on for victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Three of ACT's five tries against a struggling Queensland came from front-row forwards, with hooker Stephen Moore scoring one and prop Ben Alexander two to underline their dominance in the pack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>No. 8 Ita Vaea and center Christian Lealiifano also got in on the act against an injury-hit Queensland, which had flanker Liam Gill yellow-carded early in the second half and was missing a string of regulars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>ACT leads the Super Rugby table by two points from the Hurricanes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Stormers are a further two points back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Crusaders 34 (Andy Ellis, Kieron Fonotia, Kieran Read tries; penalty try; Dan Carter 4 conversions, 2 penalties), Lions 6 (Elton Jantjies 2 penalties).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>HT: 13-3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Highlanders 26 (Tom Franklin, Waisake Naholo, Ben Smith, Patrick Osborne tries; Lima Sopoaga 3 conversions), New South Wales Waratahs 19 (Nick Phipps, Matt Carraro, Stephen Hoiles tries; Bernard Foley 2 conversions).</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>HT: 14-12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>ACT 29 (Ben Alexander 2, Stephen Moore, Ita Vaea, Christian Lealiifano tries; Lealiifano 2 conversions), Queensland 0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>HT: 10-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Chiefs 28 (Aaron Cruden, James Lowe, Sam Cane tries; Cruden 2 conversions, 3 penalties), Stormers 19 (Kobus van Wyk try; Kurt Coleman conversion, 3 penalties, Demetri Catrakilis penalty).</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>HT: 13-16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sharks 27 (Marcell Coetzee 2, Francois Steyn, Jack Wilson tries; Pat Lambie 2 conversions, penalty), Cheetahs 10 (Francois Venter try; Francois Brummer conversion, Willie du Plessis penalty).</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>HT: 22-3.</td></tr>
