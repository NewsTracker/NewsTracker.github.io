<h3>'Cartel Land' shows good and bad of vigilantes in Mexico, US</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - The documentary "Cartel Land" opens with chilling night scenes of large-scale methamphetamine cooking in rural Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>What viewers later learn is how such drug production became deeply intertwined with the vigilante movement that emerged in 2013 and 2014 to oust the region's main drug cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>New York-based director Matthew Heineman gained unprecedented access to gun-toting vigilantes in Michoacan, where those "self-defense" forces eventually drove the pseudo-religious Knights Templar cartel out of much of the western state, but wound up being infiltrated by former cartel gunmen, rival cartels and new gangs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Led by farmers, orchard owners and small-town doctors, the movement captured the imagination of Mexicans fed up with drug violence and a government that in parts of the country is too corrupt or too inept to fight back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The central question I'm trying to answer in this film is whether it's just for citizens to take the law into their own hands," Heineman said at a recent news conference in Mexico City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's a story about what we would do if violence came to our front door."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Heineman paired the story of Michoacan with the tale of vigilantes north of the border: war veteran Tim "Nailer" Foley and his Arizona Border Recon that patrols areas of that state looking for migrants but, more importantly, drug smugglers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It would seem like an odd coupling, but Foley expresses admiration for the Mexican vigilantes, who, like Foley, are fighting a quixotic battle against the drug cartels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This is a war of David and Goliath, and we're David," Foley says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But it is the Mexican vigilante movement, along with its charismatic leader, Dr. Jose Manuel Mireles, that receives the most attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Describing the Knights Templar's reign of terror and extortion, Mireles asks, if facing a similar situation, "What would you do?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Heineman originally planned only to tell the story of American vigilantes, he said, but after hearing about Michoacan, "the film took a complete shift and became this parallel story about citizens on both sides of the border fighting back against the cartels."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Much of it is the first time such aspects of the Michoacan movement have been captured on film, which won awards for best cinematography and best director for a U.S. documentary at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Heineman, a cameraman and a team of two or three people spent two weeks of each month in the field for nine months, allowing them intimate access to both the good and bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Feared Knights Templar gunmen are captured and turned over to police, and emboldened townspeople face down Mexican troops trying to confiscate the vigilantes' guns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But toward the close of the film, a uniformed police officer acknowledges producing drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Another says he is a member of a new gang, known as "Los Viagra."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The documentary is beautifully filmed, with harrowing action scenes and sound that put viewers in the middle of what they're seeing, including a torture center run by the vigilantes, where they are seen and heard abusing detained prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I never knew who I was with - the good guys or the bad guys," Heineman said in an earlier Sundance interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The film, with the Academy Award-winning director Kathryn Bigelow as executive producer, opens in Mexico on Thursday, in New York on Friday and later in other U.S. cities.</td></tr>
