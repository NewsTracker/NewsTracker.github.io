<tr><td>8</td><td>"We must now stand together. We are united in our great grief."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It took investigators hours to reach the site, led by mountain guides to the craggy ravine in the southern French Alps, not far from the Italian border and the French Riviera.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>A helicopter crew that landed briefly in the area saw no signs of life, French officials said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>He did not say whether it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The two devices -- actually orange boxes designed to survive extreme heat and pressure -- should provide investigators with a second-by-second timeline of the plane's flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The voice recorder takes audio feeds from four microphones within the cockpit and records all the conversations between the pilots, air traffic controllers as well as any noises heard in the cockpit.</td></tr>

<tr><td>36</td><td>The plane left Barcelona Airport at 10:01 a.m. and had reached its cruising height of 38,000 feet when it suddenly went into an eight-minute descent to just over 6,000 feet, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann told reporters in Cologne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"We cannot say at the moment why our colleague went into the descent, and so quickly, and without previously consulting air traffic control," said Germanwings' director of flight operations, Stefan-Kenan Scheib.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>At 10:30, the plane lost radio contact with the control centre but "never declared a distress alert," Eric Heraud of the French Civil Aviation Authority told the AP.</td></tr>

<tr><td>40</td><td>The site is 700 kilometres south-southeast of Paris.</td></tr>

<tr><td>42</td><td>Authorities faced a long and difficult search-and-recovery operation because of the area's remoteness.</td></tr>

<tr><td>44</td><td>Snow coated nearby mountaintops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>French Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said the crash site covered several acres, with thousands of pieces of debris, "which leads us to think the impact must have been extremely violent at very high speed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Search operations were suspended overnight and were to resume at daybreak, though about 10 gendarmes remained in the desolate ravine to guard the crash site, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Winkelmann said the pilot, whom he did not name, had more than 10 years' experience working for Germanwings and its parent airline Lufthansa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Florian Graenzdoerffer Lufthansa Spokesman for North Rhine Westphalia said the company had to cancel seven flights out of Dusseldorf because a number of crew members felt they were unfit to fly following news of the accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"I can't tell you any details because this is a personal decision and in our business we have an agreement if a crew feels unfit to fly ... then we respect this," Graenzdoerffer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The aircraft was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991, had approximately 58,300 flight hours in some 46,700 flights, Airbus said.</td></tr>
