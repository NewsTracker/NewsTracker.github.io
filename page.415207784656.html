<h3>Chad president tells Boko Haram leader to surrender or face death</h3>

<tr><td>3</td><td>"He was in Dikwa two days ago. He managed to get away but we know where he is. It's in his interests to surrender," Deby said, referring to a town in northeastern Nigeria held by Boko Haram that fell to Chad's army earlier this week.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Each time the leader has resurfaced to issue a fresh jihadist video, one of numerous videos the group has made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Chadian army is considered one of the best in the region, backed by a strong air force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It first deployed to help Cameroon fend off Boko Haram and is now pressing southwest into Nigerian territory after capturing the border town of Gambaru last month.</td></tr>

<h3>SkyMall magazine may get re-launch with more practical items</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The magazine's parent company filed for bankruptcy in January and the business was planned to be sold at auction in March, but Yahoo reports there may be a reprieve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Scott Jordan, CEO of the travel clothing company ScotteVest, told the website he is in negotiations to revive SkyMall, but plans to add an interesting twist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're going to include items in the magazine that people actually want to buy," he told the website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>SkyMall's revenues in the first nine months of 2014 was just $15.8 million - a sharp decline from the $33.7 million earned in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company said that more Internet access on planes meant passengers had other things to do on their flights than look through their catalog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jim Louderback, a former editor in chief of PC Magazine who will co-manage the relaunch, told Yahoo the magazine will include articles explaining how many of its new items work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>We're going to include items in the magazine that people actually want to buy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We're going to make it an entertaining experience, a curated shopping journey targeted at real travelers and their interests," he told the website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There will still be the unique items, but it will be a smaller part of the newly planned edition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We want the readers to continue to have the experience of the unexpected, of wonder, of delight," Louderback said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"You'll be seeing stuff like the next Pet Rock, the new fake Google Glass-type gag, whatever may tap into that month's zeitgeist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The magazine will also advertise practical merchandise that could be needed for a trip, such as clothing or a camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The goods could then be immediately shipped to the customer's hotel room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There would also be listings for activities at their destinations like tours, hotel rooms or cruises, the website reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's something that will help people to actually look forward to getting on a plane - 'I wonder what I can buy in the catalog this time,'" Louderback said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Use of this website signifies your agreement to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</td></tr>
