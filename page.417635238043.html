<h3>France proves fertile ground for Islamic State recruitment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The number of French recruits to Islamic State is rising unstoppably, in spite of waves of new measures to halt it, according to French officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>France is Europe's biggest source of foreign fighters for the extremist militia, with 1700 people estimated to have joined so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Of those, some 200 have been killed and yet new recruits continue to join.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officials estimate that the flow of new volunteers is enough to replace the losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We have to be honest," said an official at the Ministry of External Affairs in Paris speaking on a background basis this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They have very effective propaganda. They have the initiative; we are reactive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The number of recruits had doubled in 18 months and battlefield victories against IS forces in Iraq would be the most effective counter, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>France, an American ally, held the US responsible for the chaos in Syria and Iraq where IS has declared its so-called caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Officials in the ministry blamed the US President Barack Obama for declaring a "red line" in Syria's civil war, then failing to act when Syria's embattled dictator, Bashar Al-Assad, crossed it, using chemical weapons against rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They didn't act. We think had we made an intervention in Syria, history would have been totally different, and terror operations would not have reached this scale. That was our big disappointment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>France is contributing air strikes to the US-led coalition effort now in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Officials said France had no quibble with Washington's strategy to repulse IS in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The US itself, nonetheless, is reviewing its approach to Iraq's army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When IS scored a victory last month by driving Iraq's army out of the city of Ramadi, US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter said Iraqi troops "lacked the will to fight".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Obama said this week that he was considering plans for "accelerating the number of Iraqi forces that are properly trained and equipped and have a focused strategy and good leadership".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>French officials conceded that they have a poor understanding of the appeal of IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>France fears further terrorist attacks at home following the January attack on the office of magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket: "It is a daily miracle that we have no attacks", an official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We are very much worried that could happen again because all factors are still in place, especially the Daesh internet propaganda."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>French officialdom calls the group by its Arabic acronym, Daesh, to deny the group the legitimacy of its self-bestowed name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Among other measures, France has given its security agencies the power to shut down internet sites, and spy on its citizens' phone and internet activity.</td></tr>
