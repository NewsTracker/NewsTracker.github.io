<h3>Home teams win all 15 games for 1st time in MLB history (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Home sweep home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>When the Seattle Mariners beat Baltimore 6-5 in 10 innings Tuesday night, it marked the first time in baseball history all 15 home teams won on the same day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Viewing every game as a 50-50 proposition independent of all others, STATS figured the odds of a home sweep on a night with a full major league schedule at 1 in 32,768.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Now that's home cookin'!</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>STATS said previously the best performance by hosts had been 11-0, accomplished six times - three in the 1800s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The most recent occasion was Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>16, 1989.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''Without saying, it's more difficult on the road,'' said manager Bruce Bochy of the World Series champion Giants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Cleveland and Miami also needed extra innings to come out on top in their own ballparks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Other winners were: Toronto, Tampa Bay, Kansas City, Minnesota, St. Louis, Arizona, San Diego, San Francisco, the New York Mets, the Chicago Cubs, the Chicago White Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Four visiting teams got shut out: Atlanta at Tampa Bay; Colorado by the Mets; the Angels against the White Sox; and the Nationals at Dodger Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The last time home clubs went undefeated on a day with more than one game was an 8-0 record on Aug. 28, 2008 - although road squads were 7-0 on April, 2, 2013, according to STATS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Arizona and Tampa Bay joined the majors as expansion franchises in 1998, bringing the total to 30 teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the last game to finish, Seattle squandered a three-run lead in the eighth inning against the Orioles before Austin Jackson's bases-loaded single down the right-field line won it for the Mariners at Safeco Field.</td></tr>
