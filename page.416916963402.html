<h3>Mexico may have right girl to return to mother in Texas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - A girl claiming to be a Houston woman's daughter illegally taken to Mexico eight years ago has turned herself in to a court that mistakenly sent another girl to the United States against her will last month, an official said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The court official in the southwestern state of Michoacan said a girl who identified herself as Alondra Diaz showed up at the court building accompanied by three relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the court was evaluating the girl's paperwork and identity documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The whereabouts of Alondra Diaz have been unknown since 2007, when her father allegedly took her to Mexico without her mother's consent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In April, a judge erroneously sent another girl named Alondra to be reunited with Houston resident Dorotea Garcia, who was convinced she was her long-lost daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The case attracted international attention after video circulated on social media showing Alondra Luna Nunez being taken kicking and screaming from court by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Days later, DNA testing in the United States proved that Alondra Luna was not Garcia's daughter, and she was returned to her family in Guanajuato, Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The girl and her family had asked for a DNA examination before she was sent to Texas, but the judge said that was not within her authority and declined to order the test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Susana Nunez, the mother of Alondra Luna, sounded a note of caution after what she called her family's nightmare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I hope the authorities simply make sure that this girl is truly her, that they have the right girl," Nunez told The Associated Press by phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If it turns out to be the right Alondra, she said, "I'm happy for her and her mother."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nunez said her daughter was doing well following her ordeal, returning to school and resuming the usual life of a teenager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"She has calmed down," Nunez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Associated Press writer Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed.</td></tr>
