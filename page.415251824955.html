<h3>Apple to join Dow Jones stock index</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The switch will take place after the close of trading on Wednesday March 18, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple will start trading as part of the 30-stock Dow at the opening of trading the next day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>S&P Dow Jones Indices said it is making the move in response to a planned stock split for Visa, another member of the 119-year-old barometer of the stock market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After its four-to-one stock split, Visa will wind up with a lower price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>S&P said that would reduce the weight of the information technology sector in the Dow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Adding Apple will help balance out this reduction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Unlike other stock market measures, the Dow weighs members by their prices, so a large change in the price of one stock can have a big effect on the overall index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>S&P said swapping Apple for AT&T will not alter the Dow's level.</td></tr>
