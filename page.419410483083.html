<h3>Google innovates a new kind of Wi-Fi router in latest step towards smart homes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google's OnHub is a Wi-Fi router, but not as you know them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It has 13 internal antennas to pull internet from different networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google has launched a Wi-Fi router, the latest move in the company's efforts to get ready for the connected home and draw more users to its services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The cylinder-shaped device, named OnHub, is designed to replace the tangle of cords and hard-to-interpret flashing lights of a standard router with something more akin to a home appliance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>So far Google has only announced it for sale in the US and Canada, at a price of $US199.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Many of us keep our router on the floor and out of sight, where it doesn't work as well," Google said in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"[But] you'll be happy placing OnHub out in the open, where your router performs its best."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Small and without a tangle of cords attached, OnHub is designed to sit out in the open where Wi-Fi routers are most effective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The router comes with multiple internal antennas that will scan the airwaves to spot the fastest connection method at all times, and will constantly avoid interference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Users will also be able to prioritise a device so that they can get the fastest internet speeds for data-heavy activities such as downloading content or streaming a movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The router can be controlled from a phone with Google's On app to run network checks, keep track of bandwidth use and many other things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The router can be monitored via smartphone, so no more trying to work out what the blinking lights are telling you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Google said OnHub automatically updates with new features and the latest security upgrades, just like the company's Android OS and Chrome browser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Updating a traditional router's software is often too tricky for the standard user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The router is being manufactured by network company TP-LINK, Google said, hinting that ASUS could be the second manufacturing partner for the product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The product launch comes days after Google restructured itself by creating Alphabet, a holding company to pool its many subsidiaries and separate the core web advertising business from newer ventures like driverless cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Making products for the smart home is one such venture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Google last year bought Nest, a smart thermostat maker, for $US3.2 billion, aiming to lead the way on how household devices link to each other and to electricity grids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Google has also been working on providing faster internet with its Google Fiber service in some US cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>New user?</td></tr>
