<h3>What does Google have in store for the future?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Google logo is seen at the garage where the company was founded on Google's 15th anniversary in Menlo Park, Calif., Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>26, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It seems like there is no rest for the tech giant that Google has become.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What was once intended to be simply a backbone search for larger (at the time) companies, such as Yahoo, has grown in epic proportions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Did you know that Google has been known to rent goats to "mow" its grass at the Googleplex complex in Mountain View, Calif.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I wonder if that was part of the inspiration for the recently released Goat Simulator?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It turns out that it's not all goats and green living in Mountain View, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google has been experimenting with all kinds of things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Most recently, it has given users of their popular Gmail system the ability to "undo" sending an e-mail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Although this feature has been available for a long time in its labs, it is now available to everyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After hitting send, you have around 30 seconds to "undo" the send to think about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Many of us get upset and send messages we wish we hadn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Or sometimes, you might have told a coworker you loved them thinking it was a close friend (those that have too many people named "Chris" in their life might know what I'm talking about here).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Whatever your reason, whatever your mistake, this new feature could be as useful as saving lives as blood transfusions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>What if your next user interface was virtual?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If Google has anything to do with it, it just might be like that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Smaller than a fingernail, Google's Soli uses radar radio waves to detect movement and images - as many as 10,000 per second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Whatever device it's connected to can receive inputs from movements you make with your hands and fingers (and possibly other parts of your body in the future).</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>An example that I have seen shows someone turning a dial "virtually," causing a change on the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Turn your fingers forward and the dial spins forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Go backwards, and the correct result shows on the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Except, there is no dial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>You just make the movements like there is one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Google lost out on buying the live-streaming site Twitch last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Everyone reported Google was the main suitor and suddenly Amazon swooped in and paid a staggering $970 million for the service which is mainly used by gamers who stream their gameplays for others to watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Twitch has gone on to become a huge success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Rather than just cry about what went wrong and how they lost out on the deal, Google has been hard at work creating its own "Twitch killer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Part of YouTube Gaming will launch later this summer and adds features that Twitch doesn't have, such as the ability to pause and rewind live streams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Twitch is likely to follow suit, which proves competition is a good thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Of course, Google isn't just all about streaming and websites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Its investments in things, such as windmills and clean energy should not go unnoticed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The company clearly has its sights set on a larger global domination picture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Google is even trying to better understand bees with its beekeeping adventures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>It would seem that Google-branded honey tastes pretty darn good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Of course, now Google is working on the Google Brain (which I thought was just what its employees called the search engine around the office).</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It seems like not everything they make turns to gold but that's okay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Microsoft has suffered from the same problem over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The thing is, Google has enough money and technical prowess behind it to keep pushing the mediocre stuff until it's really good or just throw in the towel when it realizes it has made a mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>This would cause most companies to go out of business or have major issues, but when you are Google it doesn't matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The most amazing thing about Google, to me, is that the company isn't even 20 years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>That's right, it's not even of legal drinking age in its home country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Oh, how times have changed.</td></tr>
