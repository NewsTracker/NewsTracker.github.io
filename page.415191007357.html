<h3>Jihadi John was radicalized by MI5 tactics, some Brits say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>UK security forces were following the man identified last week as West Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, 26, years before he slipped into Syria and emerged as the spokesman for the terror group's ugliest crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Starting in 2009, the computer science grad was approached multiple times by the British intelligence agency MI5, according to Cage, a London-based advocacy group that communicated with Emwazi before he went to Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to emails and interview transcripts released by Cage, British intelligence officers listened to Emwazi's phone calls, detained him abroad and blocked his future travel attempts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They showed up at his family's home and shadowed him online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Emwazi told campaigners he was pressured to work for MI5, and when he refused, threatened with further harassment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Listen Mohammed: You've got the whole world in front of you, you're 21 years old; you just finished 'uni' - why don't you work for us?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Emwazi claims an MI5 officer told him in Amsterdam in 2009, according to a voice transcript released Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When he refused, he claimed he was told: "You're going to have a lot of trouble. ... You're going to be known ... you're going to be followed ... life will be harder for you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Home Office, which oversees Britain's domestic security and immigration, is refusing to confirm or deny any information about their agencies' interactions with Emwazi, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the Home Office has previously confirmed that it used tactics similar to those described by Emwazi to track young British Muslim men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nothing justifies the murders of civilian journalists, aid workers and others that Emwazi apparently presided over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But MI5's approach to men like him matters because of a claim that has sparked fierce debate here: that Emwazi's treatment by the UK fueled his radicalization, and not the other way around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"You keep hitting someone with a stick, he's gonna turn around and hit you one day," a young Muslim Londoner told GlobalPost in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>MI5 recruitment efforts feature in several prominent terror cases in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The agency tried to recruit Michael Adebolajo months before he murdered a British soldier in London in 2013, his friend told the BBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A young Somali-Brit named Mahdi Hashi told the Independent newspaper that MI5 tried to get him to work for them in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He was later stripped of his British citizenship while traveling abroad, then ended up in a US court on terror charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In 2013, a young Muslim living in London described to GlobalPost his experience with MI5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That interview was arranged by Cage, the same group that took up Emwazi's case in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The man, who denied links to extremism or terrorism, said he was stopped twice at airports and asked to "help out" by British security officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The recruitment campaign lasted for months, with an officer making frequent visits and calls to his home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It culminated in a bizarre episode in which a motorcycle courier dropped off a plain package to the man's home one Sunday morning containing a brand new cell phone and a note: "Switch on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The single number programmed into its address book was the same one officers gave him at the airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The visits stopped when he contacted a human rights lawyer, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But the experience left him feeling confused, frightened and angry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The psychology of the whole thing - it's humiliating, it's aggressive," he said at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It is not clear exactly when Emwazi attracted officials' attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>His name came up as an associate of previous terror suspects, according to court documents seen by the Observer newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>An associate of his was linked to the foiled plot to blow up another London subway station, two weeks after the deadly July 2005 attacks on the city's public transit system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He was a "person of interest" in a 2007 investigation into a UK cell recruiting for Al Shabaab, the Al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Officers reportedly accused Emwazi of going to join Al Shabaab when they stopped him in Tanzania in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Cage claims that Emwazi was going there for a safari vacation with friends to celebrate ending his studies at the University of Westminster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>His detention in Tanzania and subsequent interrogations in Amsterdam and Britain marked the beginning of a three-and-a-half-year period when Emwazi was repeatedly contacted, questioned and blocked from traveling by MI5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>When he sold a laptop on a UK online classified site in 2010 and realized that the purchaser was a security agent, he panicked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I knew it was them!!" he emailed a reporter at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking, not fearing they may kill me. Rather, fearing that one day, I'll take as many pills as I can so that I can sleep for ever!! I just want to get away from these people!!!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The impact of Emwazi's reported run-ins with the agency have been a divisive subject here in Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Some see it as a case of sharp-eyed intelligence, identifying early a person who clearly possessed the potential to cause harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>MI5's only mistake, lawmakers and others have said, was allowing Emwazi to slip from their control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Others claim that the agency's treatment contributed to his alienation from and anger toward Britain, feelings IS was able to capitalize on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"When are we going to finally learn that when we treat people as if they're outsiders they will look for belonging elsewhere?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Asim Qureshi, Cage's director, told reporters last week.</td></tr>

<h3>After speech, White House could determine Netanyahu's fate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a speech that stirred political intrigue in two countries, Netanyahu told Congress that negotiations underway between Iran and the U.S. would "all but guarantee" that Tehran will get nuclear weapons, a step that the world must avoid at all costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gestures as he speaks before a joint meeting of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 3, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, left, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, listen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks before a joint meeting of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 3, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, stands with senators on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 3, 2015, as they host a luncheon following his speech to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>From left are, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Netanyahu, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nev., and Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin of Ill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing a tough re-election fight in two weeks, the U.S. Congress has handed him an unprecedented boost with its effusive welcome to a message that resonates at home: Iran cannot be trusted as a threshold nuclear state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Which way it goes for Netanyahu may hinge on whether Israel is in some perceptible way punished by the White House for its leader's extraordinary offensive against a U.S. president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If he is seen as having bravely spoken truth to power and escaped consequences, the episode will likely help him at the polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That could deeply affect the Middle East for years to come on issues far beyond Iran, most notably the conflict with the Palestinians, which some consider even more important than the nature of any future deal on Iran's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At home and abroad, Netanyahu is seen by many as a leading obstacle to peace with the Palestinians and perhaps the Arab world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And his insistence on continuing Jewish settlement of the occupied West Bank has many fearing Israel will never be able to extricate itself from the territory and its millions of Palestinians - with or without peace - destroying its character as a Jewish state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For this and other reasons, Netanyahu has found himself at increasingly toxic loggerheads with the country's elites - from the security establishment to academics, journalists, cultural figures and much of the business world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This has been recently compounded by scandals involving his expenses, and rage from middle-class Israelis who struggle to make ends meet and can no longer afford to buy homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Polls show Netanyahu's Likud party slightly trailing the Zionist Union, which is the main grouping of the center-left opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In the highly fractured political environment, it seems plausible that the union's head, Isaac Herzog, may be given a first chance to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat Knesset after the March 17 vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Under these circumstances, while Netanyahu's speech was delivered to the U.S. Congress, his primary audience may well have been Israel's voters half a world away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In a comedy show that aired just before the speech, a mock Netanyahu was portrayed filling out U.S. immigration forms on the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Under "reason for visit" he declared: "one or two seats" in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The images of Netanyahu mingling with congressional leaders and receiving standing ovations may achieve just that, or even better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Netanyahu made no mention of the election - but he deftly touched on Israeli fears and emotions with a litany of talking points that form the core of his political playbook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He condemned Iran as dangerously hostile, with tentacles stretching across the Middle East - and managed to connect it to this week's Jewish holiday of Purim, in which ancient Jews defeated a Persian enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He presented Israel as peace-loving and progressive and stressed its deep bonds to the U.S. He even produced Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who waved as Netanyahu intoned "Never Again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Even opponents acknowledged the masterful political theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"There is no doubt that Prime Minister Netanyahu knows how to speak," said Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But it was risky: Netanyahu's references to an emerging "bad deal" undermined a centerpiece of the U.S. administration's foreign policy and challenged its insistence that no deal has yet been struck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The event was engineered by the Republican House speaker, John Boehner, and Netanyahu's ambassador to Washington, U.S.-born Ron Dermer, who once worked as a Republican operative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The White House made no secret about its unhappiness, making sure Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden were not present and refusing to meet the Israeli leader while he was in town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Dozens of congressional Democrats, caught between support for Israel and loyalty to the president, skipped the address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Some who attended gave it a cool response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, said she was "near tears" and "saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But the mood in Netanyahu's entourage was upbeat afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In a statement released after he landed back in Israel on Wednesday, Netanyahu said his speech to Congress offered a "practical alternative" to a possible Iranian nuclear deal and that U.S. lawmakers now "understand better" why the deal is bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Hebrew University, said that to an Israeli audience Netanyahu's speech was "so exciting, so powerful" that "it will definitely help him in the campaign."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Diskin noted, though, that the remaining two weeks are a long time in Israeli politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Israel's media on Wednesday reflected that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Many praised the form, such as Meir Uziel, who gushed in the Maariv daily that "the speech was artistry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But there was also a strong sense that Netanyahu had upset Obama for little practical gain on Iran, using the august foreign setting for an electoral maneuver that Sima Kadmon, writing in Yediot Ahronot, called "the most ornate (political) survival speech ever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Much now depends on the White House response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Although Obama is somewhat unpopular in Israel, if Netanyahu is perceived as having truly unsettled relations with the U.S., it could boomerang.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>On Tuesday Obama dismissed the speech as nothing new and noted that it is the president who runs foreign policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>But Israelis fear much worse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The White House has already stopped briefing the Israelis on some sensitive details from the ongoing nuclear talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>And some in Israel fret that if Netanyahu is re-elected, relations with the White House will be poisonous for the remaining two years of Obama's term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>That could undermine everything from weapons sales to critical and nearly automatic U.S. support at the United Nations and other international organizations where Israel finds itself increasingly isolated and under assault by the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"Netanyahu remains alone and Israel remains isolated," Herzog said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"The speech therefore caused damage of the utmost severity in relations with the United States ... and will only widen the rift with our great friend and our only strategic ally."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The Palestinians are also unhappy with events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Senior Palestinian official Nabil Shaath said the images from a supportive Congress cast doubts on America's impartiality in peace talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"I think honest brokers don't do what the congressmen did with Mr. Netanyahu - the man who leads the occupation, the aggression against the people of Palestine," Shaath said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Israel's opposition will try to turn attention back toward domestic issues, where Netanyahu is more vulnerable, and away from both Iran and the Palestinian issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Herzog favors a far more conciliatory position, genuine negotiations and limits on settlements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>But decades of inconclusive talks and intermittent violence have made Israelis tired of the Palestinian issue and inclined to look away - until it suddenly seizes center stage, as it so regularly does.</td></tr>
