<h3>Binges and bailouts: How Greece got to the brink</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FRANKFURT, Germany -- After two bailouts totaling 240 billion euros ($266 billion) and six years of depression, spending cuts and lost jobs, Greece teeters on the edge of collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>How did it come to this?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Why couldn't all that money and all that sacrifice turn around a country that makes up less than two per cent of the 19-country eurozone economy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Sunday the country will hold a referendum on whether or not to accept the tough creditor conditions attached to loans needed to avoid default and a banking collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A "no" may lead to a chaotic departure from the shared euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Even "yes" is no guarantee the creditors will agree to lend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There is no way around it: Greece engaged in a three-decades-long credit binge starting in the early 1980s, spending the money on plush government jobs for supporters of the country's two major political parties - the center-left PASOK and center-right New Democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Taking turns in office, they paid their followers well - driving up private sector wages and making Greece a costly place to do business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They also looked the other way on widespread tax evasion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Independent professionals - including doctors and lawyers - often reported less income than factory workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Despite its rickety finances, Greece shaped up a little for a few years and qualified to join the single currency in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It was a time of euphoria and confidence in the euro, seen as a rival to the dollar as a global currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>New members were desired to boost the EU's biggest hope for European integration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Greece was waved in, and promptly went back to its old ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The arrival of the euro only fueled the debt binge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>German and French banks found they could now buy Greek government bonds in euros, not drachmas that might devalue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greece borrowed at what in retrospect were ridiculously low interest rates, just a bit more than those charged to rock-solid Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They were in the euro, the thinking went, what could go wrong?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In October 2009, after the global financial crisis had made investors more wary of risk, Greece revealed its deficit was far higher than advertised, and its finances were out of control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Its borrowing costs shot up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It couldn't pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>When the party ended, Greece got a 110 billion euro bailout in 2010 from the other eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The creditors attached tough conditions to cut spending and deficits, and to tackle the rampant bureaucracy and corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Yet the cuts quickly undermined growth, which fell below the optimistic estimates of the creditors who miscalculated how much they would weigh on the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>There was a contradiction that couldn't be resolved: cuts in public spending were needed to reduce Greece's cost base because it couldn't devalue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Yet the lower public spending pushed down GDP and simply made the debt burden bigger compared to the size of the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>With its own currency, Greece could have defaulted on its debts and devalued, quickly erasing its international cost problem, and moved on within a few years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Cutting wages and prices is tougher, and takes longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In that sense, the euro has prolonged the agony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>By 2012, it was clear the first bailout wasn't doing the trick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A second rescue included sticking Greece's private creditors with losses on their bonds, along with yet more loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Yet creditors continued to underestimate how much damage austerity would do to growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The debt level, measured as a fraction of the economy, continued to increase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Even at the time of the deal, most economists and policy makers expected that further debt reduction or easier terms were inevitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>But the reshuffle of Greece's debt meant that instead of owing bond investors, Greece's creditors were now European taxpayers, the IMF and the ECB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>With taxpayers on the hook, resistance to further debt relief stiffened in place like Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Still, for a while it looked like the second bailout might do the trick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The Greek government under Prime Minister Antonis Samaras narrowed deficits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Some reforms were implemented, while others were passed but didn't really take effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The economy bottomed out, after an agonizing fall of around 25 per cent, and appeared ready to start growing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Greece did get some easier terms on interest and time to pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In September 2014, Greece had only weeks left before it successfully completed the second bailout and transitioned to milder forms of assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Approaching the finish line, Samaras stumbled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>He announced that Greece would expel its hated creditor monitors and return to bond markets without outside help or advice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The idea fell flat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Interest yields rose sharply on its remaining debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Instead of getting the last of the bailout money, in December the floundering Samaras had to call an early election held in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Voters, who were fed up with years of agony, chose Syriza, a hard-left party that won support with its demands for debt reduction and no more austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Creditors balked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Uncertainty quickly tanked the fledgling recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The bailout was first extended and then allowed to expire Tuesday as Syriza and creditors talked past one another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The last bailout money, some 7.2 billion euros, had slipped out of Greece's grasp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>And with it, perhaps, its chance of remaining in the eurozone.</td></tr>
