<h3>Magic, Oladipo spoil Rose's return in 105-103 win over Bulls (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- The Orlando Magic spoiled Derrick Rose's return from his latest knee injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Victor Oladipo had 23 points and scored on a layup with 1.5 seconds left to give the Magic a 105-103 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Rose started and played for the first time in more than a month since undergoing surgery on his right knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But working on a minutes restriction, the point guard was 3 of 9 from the field and finished with nine points in 19 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''I felt all right,'' Rose said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I think it was about right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It'll get better the more I play, but I'm getting better every week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Bulls had a final chance with 1.5 seconds remaining, but an inbounds pass by Mike Dunleavy to Pau Gasol at the rim sailed out of bounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nik Vucevic added 22 points in the Magic's third straight win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''There's no playoff but we're trying to treat every game like a playoff game,'' Oladipo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jimmy Butler had 19 points for Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gasol, Taj Gibson and Nikola Mirotic each added 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rose was in his first action since Feb. 23 - a span of 20 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He underwent a minor operation on his right knee on Feb. 27- the latest in a string of knee issues for the former league MVP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A torn meniscus in his right knee sidelined Rose most of last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He also tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the 2012 playoff opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The plan was to ease Rose back into action by playing just 20 minutes on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau stuck pretty close to that, with Rose logging 19:24 in total.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He tried to make the most of it, and came out firing early on, connecting on two of his first four field goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Rose played just shy of 13 minutes in the first half, scoring on a pair of jumpers, including a 3-pointer, along with an assist and two turnovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But he went cold after that, missing his next six shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Orlando took advantage, and climbed out of a 15-point, first-half hole to regain the lead 77-75.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rose finally broke the drought, dropping in a fast break layup that put the Bulls back in front 71-68, before reaching his minutes limit and going to the bench for the final time with 5:34 left in the third quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''The shots I put up, I thought they were good shots before I shot it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I'm more concerned with us losing more than anything,'' Rose said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Chicago kept the momentum, and capitalized on some late Magic miscues to end the period on a 12-2 spurt, and take an 87-79 lead into the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But Orlando didn't go away, and tied it at 96 on a layup by Evan Fournier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A 3-pointer by Mirotic briefly put Chicago back up 99-96.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Oladipo responded with a floater and 3-pointer to nudge the Magic up in front 101-99.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Out of a timeout, Gasol got free in the lane for a layup and was fouled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He missed his ensuing free throw, leading to a jumper by Orlando's Aaron Gordon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Aaron Brooks turned it over the Bulls' next trip down the floor, but Fournier came up short on a jumper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A scramble for a rebound after a Bulls miss went out of bounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A replay review gave it back to Chicago with 11.5 seconds to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Gasol was then fouled by Gordon and connected on both free throws to set up Oladipo's layup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Rose said the hardest part was watching from the bench late in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''Very hard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>At the same time, it's all about patience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>I'm going to have my turn,'' Rose said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>''Right now while I'm not playing, I'm just trying to learning a little more and seeing how they're playing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Bulls: G Kirk Hinrich returned after missing last two games with a hyperextended left knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Magic: Connected on their first 19 free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>...G Evan Fournier returned after missing last 17 games with a sore right hip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>G Willie Green (hyperextended right knee) and Devyn Marble (eye) both sat out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Wednesday marked just the 20th time this season that the Bulls lineup of Rose, Butler, Joakim Noah, Gasol and Mike Dunleavy started together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>''That's all you can do is try to build some continuity,'' Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Bulls: At Miami on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Magic: Host Raptors on Friday night.</td></tr>
