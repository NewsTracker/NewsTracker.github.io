<h3>Germanwings crash: Lufthansa defends not reporting depression</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>German doctors want pilots to have to undergo expanded drug and mental health tests in the wake of the Germanwings crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>German aviation industry doctors say that pilots should undergo more extensive medical checks in the wake of the Germanwings crash in the French Alps that killed 150 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In response to prosecutors' allegations that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the Duesseldorf-bound Germanwings plane on March 24 on a day that he was supposed to be off sick, the head of the German Pilots' Doctors Association urged more thorough examinations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are calling for more frequent and comprehensive laboratory tests for pilots," the association's chief Hans-Werner Teichmueller told Welt newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The annual physical required of pilots only includes a test of urine, haemoglobin levels and in some cases blood sugar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If a standard blood test is ordered, only indirect evidence of excessive alcohol consumption can be identified and no evidence of drug use, according to Welt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Teichmueller said that key data on the liver, kidneys and cholesterol levels were also absent from a typical medical file kept on pilots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the immediate aftermath of the catastrophe, the association's vice president, Uwe Beiderwellen, had said that he opposed routine psychological tests for pilots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Germanwings parent company Lufthansa acknowledged last week that Lubitz had informed its flight school in mid-2009, when resuming training after a lengthy medical absence, that he had suffered from a "previous episode of severe depression".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He later received the medical certificate confirming he was fit to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>German prosecutors said that Lubitz was diagnosed as suicidal "several years ago", before he became a pilot, but doctors had recently found no sign he intended to hurt himself or others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However Lubitz was receiving treatment from neurologists and psychiatrists who had signed him off sick from work a number of times, including the day of the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ripped up sick notes were found in a flat used by Lubitz, which authorities believe indicates that the 27-year-old was trying to hide his illness from his employer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Office (LBA), which issues pilots' licences, said that Lufthansa had given it "no information about the medical background" of Lubitz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Citing medical files obtained by investigators, Bild daily reported last week that Lubitz told his doctors he was on anti-depressants and Lorazepam, a mild tranquiliser used to treat anxiety.</td></tr>
