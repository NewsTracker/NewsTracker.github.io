<h3>Prince Harry rekindling Chelsy romance?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Britain's Prince Harry reportedly enjoys the challenge of trying to win back Chelsy Davy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The couple dated on and off for seven years, calling time on the relationship in 2010 with rumours circulating that Chelsy didn't want to lead the life of a princess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However they've remained friends and after reports that Chelsy has split with her boyfriend of a year Charles Goode, many think a reconciliation is on the cards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Harry and Chelsy are talking nearly every day. They have always had amazing chemistry, so it's no wonder they've been drawn back together," an insider told British magazine Grazia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Harry and Chelsy's closeness definitely had an impact on her split with Charles. They have amazing banter as well as chemistry. They've always got on so well and everybody can see it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Since their 2010 split, Harry enjoyed a highly publicised relationship with Cressida Bonas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many thought the pair would marry, but they went their separate ways in 2014 after two years together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After seeing Chelsy at a memorial service for their mutual friend Henry van Straubenzee in December, Harry has apparently been chatting more and more to his ex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They have mutual friends so they're always at the same events, but there was something about meeting before Christmas. Since then it's been very flirty. Everyone in their circle jokes that Chelsy is Harry's Camilla because, like Camilla for his father, Chelsy is the one woman Harry could never get over," the source says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However Chelsy may not be as up for the reconciliation, as her views on a public life haven't changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"There are still the same problems as before, because Chelsy doesn't enjoy life in the spotlight and the duties that come with dating the prince. But her reluctance spurs him on. He loves a challenge and he's always seen her as the one that go away," the insider divulged.</td></tr>
