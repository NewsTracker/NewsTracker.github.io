<h3>Germanwings plane crash: 'The pain is almost unbearable': grieving Australian family visit the crash site</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Melbourne Germanwings plan crash victims Carol Friday and son Greig Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I now know the true meaning of the words grief stricken," says Mal Coram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Monday, he was to see with his own eyes the mountain that took his beloved sister and nephew away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mal, with his daughters Pippa and Georgie and son-in-law Michael, have travelled to France on behalf of their extended family to say farewell to Carol Friday, 68, and her son Greig, 29, the two Australians among the 150 who died when Germanwings flight 4U9525 came down in the Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Monday they were due to finally arrive in those mountains, carrying tributes from family and friends: poems, photos and other mementos of Australia to leave as a memorial in a foreign land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They planned to visit Le Vernet, the closest village to the crash site, where a stone marker has been erected for grieving families, in a field overshadowed by the beautiful, stark peaks of the Alpine range hit by the diving plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I felt the need to come here," Mr Coram said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I have a need to see the crash site and pay my respects to my sister and nephew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"My family suffers this loss terribly. My brother-in-law and niece are both too devastated to travel here today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dave, husband to Carol for 34 years, is being looked after by his siblings in Australia as he grieves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He helped compose the words that Mr Coram planned to read to the media at the memorial in Le Vernet on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Coram was nervous about reading them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He worried that he would not be able to get through them without breaking down, a family member told Fairfax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is a sign of the deep bond in this family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most siblings are close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Only some are soulmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"She was the linchpin of the entire family," Mr Coram said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"My life-long travelling companion and my mate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Carol's son Greig inherited those same "beautiful values", he said, always thinking of others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Greig was his godson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>His daughters considered him not just a cousin but a best friend and "soul mate for their whole lives".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Georgie and Pippa are devastated by the loss of their aunt and cousin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The pain is almost unbearable," Georgie told Fairfax Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Ms Friday, a child and maternal health nurse with the City of Casey, and Mr Friday, a graduate acoustics engineer, were on their way to meet Pippa Coram in Germany, where she lives, when the plane came down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They were on holidays together before Mr Friday started his two-year stint in Europe, where he was going to teach English in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The family's thoughts on the man who caused this grief, the flight's copilot, are a mixture of fury and disbelief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"My two brothers are back in Australia still in denial," Mr Coram said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We have decided to treat this as an accident at this stage and thus deny the perpetrator his wishes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>While in the Alps, the family plan to talk to French prosecutors who are investigating the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The family wanted to thank the people who helped them make the journey around the world: Australian Federal Police, the government, and the "sincere and supportive" captain and crews of the Lufthansa and Qantas flights they have been on in recent days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Once in the mountains, their plans are fluid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>They may revisit the memorial, out of sight of the media, again on Tuesday if they decide to stay in the region overnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Or they may decide to begin their long journey home, having said a painful farewell on foreign soil to their loved, lost, sister, aunt, nephew, cousin, and best friends.</td></tr>
