<h3>The Latest: Officials: Still interest in Gulf of Mexico oil</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW ORLEANS (AP) - The latest on the federal oil lease sale Wednesday in the western Gulf of Mexico, off the Texas coast (all times local).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The big bidder in Wednesday's oil lease sale for tracts off the Texas coast says it's very pleased with the outcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BHP Billiton Petroleum bid nearly $16.3 million for 26 of the 33 tracts auctioned Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Exploration president David Rainey says in an email from London, "In BHP Billiton, we believe that the Gulf of Mexico has significant remaining resource to be found."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He says that the company will invest where it sees potential profit even during hard times for the industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>BHP Billiton Petroleum is an arm of BHP Billiton Ltd., listed in London and Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Louisiana Oil and Gas Association President Don Briggs says Wednesday's tiny oil lease sale clearly indicates that crude oil prices are unprofitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But he says bids by five companies show continued commitment to the Gulf of Mexico despite difficult times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The 33 bids totaled less than $23 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Federal and trade group officials say there's still interest in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas, despite low figures from Wednesday's lease sale for tracts off the Texas coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bureau of Ocean Energy Management official Mike Celata (sel-AH'-tuh) says the bureau is not considering a cut in oil company royalty payments to encourage more bidding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And he notes that the oil business tends to run in cycles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Celata says the 26 bids submitted by BHP Billiton Petroleum (Deepwater) Inc. indicate long-term potential for business in the Gulf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He and National Offshore Industries Association President Randall Luthi both say there's continuing interest in the larger central Gulf, especially in deep water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Luthi says the western Gulf draws less interest because it tends to produce natural gas, which pays less than oil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Low oil prices contributed to the smallest oil lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico off of Texas since the federal government began regional sales in 1983.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Five companies bid a total of less than $23 million on 33 tracts in the western Gulf on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Each tract got a single bid, and BHP Billiton Petroleum (Deepwater) Inc. made 26 of the bids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The smallest sale in that area before Wednesday was in 1986, when $56.8 million was bid on 41 tracts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>BP Exploration and Production Inc. made a single bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ecopetrol America Inc. made one on its own and three together with Anadarko US Offshore Corp., and Peregrine OI7 Gas II LLC made two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>An offshore industries trade group said Tuesday that low oil prices were among factors likely to depress interest in the sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The federal government is offering nearly 22 million acres off the Texas coast to oil and gas developers, though low oil prices are likely to limit interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The sale is scheduled for Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The last comparable lease sales in the western Gulf of Mexico brought in $109.1 million and $100.1 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A March sale in the far more popular central Gulf of Mexico brought the lowest number of bids since 1986, and officials said low prices were the reason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Since then, the price of U.S. crude has dropped $1.44 a barrel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>An offshore trade group said in a news release Tuesday that members look forward to the sale "but do not anticipate jaw-dropping results."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The National Ocean Industries Association cites low prices, uncertainty over new regulations and an upward trend in lawsuits over permits and leases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>This story has been corrected to show in the short headline that 5 bidders were part of sale, not 5 bids.</td></tr>
