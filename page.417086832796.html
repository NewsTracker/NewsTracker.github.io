<h3>Captured Russian servicemen to be prosecuted for 'terrorist' acts, says Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ukraine says it has captured two Russian servicemen and they will be prosecuted for "terrorist acts."</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Moscow denies having any troops in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The apparent capture and possible prosecution of the servicemen and the potential embarrassment for Russia's Vladimir Putin come as the US and the European Union press Moscow to fully implement Minsk peace accords as a step to ending the crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>More than 6,100 people have been killed and Russia-West ties plunged into crisis since pro-Moscow separatists rebelled against a pro-Western leadership taking power in Ukraine more than a year ago.</td></tr>
