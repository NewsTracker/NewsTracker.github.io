<h3>Bryant 0 for 4 with 3 Ks in debut as Cubs lose to Padres 5-4 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) -- Kris Bryant had such a Chicago Cubs-like start to his major league career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Called up one day after the team ensured he can't be eligible for free agency until 2021, the prized prospect struck out in his first three at-bats against James Shields and went 0 for 4 in a 5-4 loss to San Diego Padres on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Seeking their first World Series title in 107 years, the Cubs selected Bryant's contract from Triple-A Iowa and inserted him into their starting lineup as the cleanup hitter and third baseman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Bryant cleanly handled Derek Norris' sharp first-inning grounder, starting a 5-4-3 double play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Following a two-out walk to Anthony Rizzo in the bottom half, Bryant was given a standing ovation as many in the crowd took photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With fans still on their feet, Bryant swung through three pitches for an inning-ending strikeout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He foul-tipped an 89 mph cutter on the low, outside corner, then swung over a pair of changeups.</td></tr>
