<tr><td>5</td><td>Lata Chand, 19, was heavily pregnant when the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck last Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She and her husband ran out of their house in panic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Their home was undamaged, but the hospital where she was to give birth was forced to close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Friday they went instead to a field hospital set up by the Israeli military where the baby was born.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The beaming midwife, Dganit Gery, said she hoped the birth would show all Nepalese women that there is hope for the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Lata's husband Hariender Chand said they were terrified the quake would cause her to miscarry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"When the quake struck I was thinking 'will we survive?' because most of the pregnant women miscarried their babies. I was scared it would happen to us. Now we're safe, it's good."</td></tr>
