<tr><td>9</td><td>"The choice of this film may seem surprising, given the rules generally applied to the Festival de Cannes Opening Ceremony," Thierry Fremaux, general delegate of the event, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It is a clear reflection of our desire to see the Festival start with a different piece, which is both bold and moving. Emmanuelle Bercot's film makes important statements about contemporary society, in keeping with modern cinema. It focusses on universal social issues, making it a perfect fit for the global audience at Cannes."</td></tr>
