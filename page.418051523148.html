<h3>Republicans to fight Obamacare through election campaign despite ruling</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans will keep attacking Obamacare in the U.S. Congress and on the presidential election campaign trail to energize right-wing voters and raise money, but analysts said there was little chance of the healthcare law being rolled back before 2017 now that the Supreme Court has again validated it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Thursday, the high court upheld a central part of the Affordable Care Act, as it is formally known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the second time the court confirmed the legality of President Barack Obama's biggest domestic achievement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That greatly reduces the chances of any substantive legislative or legal challenge to the law by Republicans until a new president takes office in January 2017 after Democrat Obama leaves office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>By then, the law will have been on the books for seven years and millions of Americans will have a stake in it, making it even more difficult to dismantle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is entrenched. There certainly will be no legislation (signed into law) that will change anything for the next year and a half," said Joseph Antos, an expert in health policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This administration is done with health policy. Everybody's done," Antos said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Obamacare survived a major legal test when the Supreme Court upheld tax subsidies at the heart of the law that help millions of Americans afford premiums they pay for health insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Enacted in 2010, the law was meant to provide health insurance coverage for millions of Americans who neither had insurance through an employer nor could afford an individual plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Republicans opposed the law from the start, calling it unnecessary government interference and "socialized medicine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More than 10 million people now have insurance purchased through state and federal marketplaces set up under the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>About 8.7 million of them get subsidies, the government says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Following Thursday's 6-3 court ruling, Republicans quickly vowed to make the 2016 election campaign a referendum on Obamacare, expressing disappointment with the court's decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Democrats cheered it, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On the presidential campaign trail, Democratic Party front runner Hillary Clinton expressed delight via Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Yes! SCOTUS affirms what we know is true in our hearts & under the law: Health insurance should be affordable & available to all," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Republican House Speaker John Boehner said, "We will continue our efforts to repeal the law and replace it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But it was unclear what Republicans could do to make good on that pledge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Republican lawmakers had worked on action plans for a high court ruling against the subsidies, but there seemed to be no clear Republican strategy for the ruling that was handed down, a resounding victory for Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Republican party is divided, said Robert Blendon, a health policy and politics analyst at Harvard University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>One wing "wants to go back to 2009" before Obamacare existed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Others have proposed alternatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, for instance, is urging the approval of tax credits to help people buy insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Some Republicans "feel they dodged a bullet" with the court's decision, which means they won't have to anger their base by preserving the subsidies, even temporarily, said John Ullyot, a Republican strategist and former longtime Senate aide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Most of the dozen or so Republican candidates running for their party's nomination vowed to repeal Obamacare if elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush's campaign issued a fundraising appeal for "emergency" contributions to ensure the law is rolled back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I will work with Congress to repeal and replace this flawed law," Bush said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Senator Marco Rubio, another Republican contender, said: "I remain committed to repealing this bad law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Brookings Institution analyst Stuart Butler said the law may be modified, but it is now hard to imagine it being totally repealed, even after a new president takes office in 2017.</td></tr>
