<h3>Microsoft to pre-install Office, Skype on more Android devices</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Depending on which side of the divide you're on with Microsoft services, your next Android device could be shipping with either more useful apps or more bloatware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Microsoft announced that it has signed a deal with 11 Android OEMs, including Samsung, to bring Microsoft services to tablets and devices running Google's Android operating system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Under the terms of the deal, apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, and Skype will come pre-loaded on Android devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In addition to the Samsung partnership announced at MWC 2015, Microsoft announced that it has reached agreements with Dell, TrekStor, JP Sa Couto, Datamatic, DEXP, Hipstreet, QMobile, Tecno, Casper, and Pegatron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"For OEMs, these deals will increase the value of and enrich people's experiences on Android devices," Microsoft EVP of business development Peggy Johnson said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"And for Microsoft, this is part of the company's mobile-first, cloud-first vision. /It is addressing consumer demand for top services by making them already available on a device, instead of requiring consumers to download them separately."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This means that Microsoft's apps and services will ship alongside Google's apps and services such as Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides out of the box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Although Microsoft competes with Android in the mobile space with its Windows Phone platform, soon to be renamed as Windows 10 for phones, the company has historically enjoyed a profitable relationship with Android manufacturers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Microsoft has licensing agreements with top Android OEMs for patents that Android infringes on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Most recently, the company was engaged in a lawsuit with Samsung over unpaid royalties on licensing, and it's unclear if the latest deal with Samsung to pre-load Microsoft apps on its Android devices, including the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge flagships, is a direct result of that lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Microsoft is also partnering with Xiaomi to create a custom ROM for that company's Android devices to run Windows Phone instead of Android.</td></tr>
