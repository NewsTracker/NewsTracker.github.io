We defend you, your honour, and your wealth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Baghdadi also hailed the Islamic State fighters who had "snatched Anbar from the eyes of the apostates and the throats of the Rafeda, in spite of America and its allies," using a derogatory term for Shiite Muslims and referring to US-led coalition air strikes.</td></tr>
