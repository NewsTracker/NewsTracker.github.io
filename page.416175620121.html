<h3>Iran cannot be trusted, Netanyahu warns</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It was the latest attack on the emerging deal under which Iran would curtail its nuclear activities in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Following marathon talks in the Swiss city of Lausanne, the negotiators agreed on a framework deal on April 2, which Israel has repeatedly denounced as an "historic mistake".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"To my regret, all of the things I warned about vis-a-vis the framework agreement that was put together in Lausanne are coming true before our eyes," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This framework gives the leading terrorist state in the world a certain path to nuclear bombs," he warned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"How can such a country be trusted?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The emerging deal, which is to be finalised by June 30, would leave Iran with "significant nuclear capabilities," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We see that the sanctions are being lifted, immediately, according to Iran's demand, and this is without Iran having changed its policy of aggression everywhere."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Israel and many Western governments suspect Iran's civilian nuclear programme is a front for efforts to build a military capability -- a charge which Tehran denies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Israel has the Middle East's sole, albeit undeclared, nuclear arsenal.</td></tr>
