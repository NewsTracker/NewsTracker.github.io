<h3>EU task force seeks mental exams, drug tests for pilots</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) - A European Union task force is recommending pre-employment psychological evaluations and random drug and alcohol tests for pilots to prevent a repeat of the Germanwings disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The panel led by the European Aviation Safety Agency issued its recommendations Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was formed in response to the March 24 crash of a German airliner in France that killed all 150 people onboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Experts say the plane's co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, who reportedly had a history of mental illness, deliberately flew the jet into a mountain after locking the pilot out of the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The task force's recommendations also call for keeping two people in the cockpit at all times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Its advice will now be considered by the European Commission and may lead to new EU-wide aviation safety regulations.</td></tr>
