<h3>Manchester United director David Gill set to become Fifa vice-president</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Manchester United director David Gill is set to be elected as Fifa vice-president this week, with FA chairman Greg Dyke claiming Gill can be part of an "awkward squad", trying to expose any wrongdoing within the controversy-hit organisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gill was initially reluctant to stand for the role, representing Uefa on Fifa's executive committee, but he was convinced to stand by the FA, as well as Uefa president Michel Platini.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With the 79-year-old Blatter tipped to be re-elected for a fifth, four-year term in May, the English FA nominated Gill so he could ask tough questions of Fifa's management from within the organisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"David will be the sort of person who will do the job as a Fifa executive committee member properly," English FA chairman Greg Dyke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He will not be afraid of asking appropriate questions. In fact perhaps Fifa needs to have someone from the awkward squad asking tough questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He has a strong background in finance so if there are financial questions he will know what to ask and what to look for. There is a feeling that there have been too many acolytes and not enough people asking difficult questions and ensuring that decisions are taken in a transparent, ethical and business-like manner."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Although the home nations are no longer guaranteed a Fifa vice-presidency, as the candidate will be chosen by all Uefa members and not by the four UK nations alone, Uefa will continue to choose from a list of British candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Gill is expected to easily beat rival candidate Trefor Lloyd Hughes, the Welsh FA president, in the vote at the Uefa Congress on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gill, a former accountant, worked at Manchester United during an unprecedented period of success under Sir Alex Ferguson, rising to become the club's chief executive, before stepping down in 2013 when the manager retired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gill currently sits on the board of the FA and the Uefa executive committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He and Ferguson also remain at United as directors..</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Since being elected to Uefa's executive committee in 2013, Gill has maintained a low public profile but made an impact at last year's Fifa congress by calling on Blatter to stand aside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Platini was reluctant to challenge Blatter for the top job in world football but urged Gill to bid to join him on Fifa's executive committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I aim to use my skills in football around the table and work with my Uefa colleagues to have a greater say and influence in how it operates. In terms of votes it's quite an important block," Gill said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In areas like transparency and decision-making, it's not going to happen overnight and it's arguable whether it will happen unless there is a president change. My personal view is that it needs a change at the top to ensure that the required changes take place. I'm not naive enough to think I can change things overnight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If successful, Gill win join the Fifa executive committee after the 29 May presidential election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Fifa vice-president Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein of Jordan, Dutch football chief Michael van Praag and former Portuguese international Luis Figo are challenging Blatter in a secret ballot of Fifa's 209 member associations.</td></tr>
