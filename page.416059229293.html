<h3>HBO Now streaming service launches on Apple products</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The long-anticipated unbundling of cable TV packages has begun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>HBO Now, the stand-alone streaming service, launched Tuesday morning on Apple products, HBO said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Separately, Cablevision's Optimum Online customers also now have access to the subscription HBO service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The service costs $14.99 a month, although people who sign up in April receive the service free for one month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The groundbreaking move has been anticipated since HBO Chief Executive Richard Plepler unveiled the service during an Apple product conference last month in San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is a transformative moment for HBO, and we are excited to introduce HBO Now to all of you," Plepler said at that event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The service marks the first time that HBO programming is being offered directly to consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Before now, people had to subscribe to a pay-TV package offered by a cable or satellite TV operator and then pay extra for HBO's premium channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The subscription service will offer 2,000 programming titles, including "Game of Thrones," "Girls," and "Silicon Valley."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The launch was planned to coincide with the April 12 season premiere of "Game of Thrones."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>HBO Now is aimed at attracting customers who do not currently subscribe to a pay-TV bundle but have high-speed Internet service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There are an estimated 10 million homes in the U.S. with broadband Internet service but no pay-TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The TV landscape has become increasingly competitive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Apple, in an effort to woo new customers, lowered the price of its Apple TV device to $69.</td></tr>
