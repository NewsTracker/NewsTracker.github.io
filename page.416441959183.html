<h3>Calbuco volcano erupts in Chile, and nearby town evacuated</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - The Calbuco volcano erupted Wednesday for the first time in more than 42 years, billowing a huge ash cloud over a sparsely populated, mountainous area in southern Chile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Authorities ordered the evacuation of the 1,500 inhabitants of the nearby town of Ensenada, along with residents of two smaller communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert, barring access to the area around the volcano, which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt, a little more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Chile's capital, Santiago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"For us it was a surprise," said Alejandro Verges, regional emergency director of the Los Lagos region where the eruption took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said Calbuco wasn't under any special form of observation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities said a large amount of ash was observed but no hot rocks or lava so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Calbuco last erupted in 1972 and is considered one of the top three most potentially dangerous among Chile's 90 active volcanos.</td></tr>
