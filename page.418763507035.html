<h3>Tunisia cracks down on mosques after massacre</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tunis: Among a flurry of security measures the Tunisian government began after a gunman massacred 38 tourists last month in Sousse was a crackdown on dozens of mosques, creating concerns that the secular government may be falling back toward the authoritarian ways of the former dictatorship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the middle of Ramadan early this month, the government closed 80 mosques and barred two preachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But neither the men nor most of the mosques had any known connection with Seifeddine Rezgui, the gunman who carried out the June 26 massacre, officials conceded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was another sign that the divisions between Tunisian secularists and Islamists that threatened to tear the country apart in the years after the 2011 Arab Spring uprising here are still playing out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a recent interview with the daily newspaper La Presse, Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid, who heads a government led by the secularist party Nida Tunis, described the battle to control Tunisia's 5000 mosques as a "long-term fight".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We change a radical imam from a mosque and the next day he is replaced with another extremist," Mr Essid said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But we will not give in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Notably, the main Islamist political party, al-Nahda, which holds a token cabinet post in the coalition government, has supported the government's stance against terrorism and even its regulation of mosques.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Its leaders have condemned the terrorist attacks and told followers that supporting the government, and the country, is more important right now than party support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are all in agreement that no one is allowed to preach violence," said Zied Ladhari, 39, the Nahda cabinet member and minister for vocational training and employment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The closed mosques are ones that were built without permits in a somewhat "anarchical way", he added: "No one is closing regular mosques."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But other officials say some regular mosques have been closed, and deep ideological differences exist among the main parties over how to combat extremism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Those in the mainstream Tunisian religious community warn that government controls enforced by the police send religious followers underground and stifle efforts by moderates to counter the ideology of religious extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We appreciate the police and the important role they play in fighting terrorism, but we want them to stay out of religious affairs," Abdessalem Atwi, the secretary-general of the Union of Preachers, said during a recent protest outside the country's religious affairs ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If you bring back the interior ministry, it is the police that will evaluate the sermons."</td></tr>
