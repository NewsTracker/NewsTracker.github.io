<h3>Robert Durst sends bizarre letter to Los Angeles Times reporter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Molly Hennessey-Fiske, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who has been covering proceedings against Durst, 71, after his mid-March arrest in Louisiana, received a letter purporting to have been written by the suspect in state prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The letter, post-marked April 1st in Baton Rouge, specifically states that Durst 'said nothing about charges, crimes or trials' but rambles on about Durst's thoughts on life in southern California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dick DeGuerin, Durst's lead attorney, said that the letter looked like his client's handwriting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Murder suspect Robert Durst has sent a bizarre letter, in which he mentions his taste for opera and pro football, to a Los Angeles Times reporter covering his case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Durst, who was arrested for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman last month, pleaded not guilty to weapons charges on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'Bob is his own person and he's writing letters to people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As long as they're not discussing the facts or legal plans or strategy, I don't have any problem with it,' Mr DeGuerin told The Los Angeles Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Durst, who was heir to a vast real estate empire before becoming estranged from his family, was arrested last month for the suspected 2000 murder of his friend, writer Susan Berman, in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His letter to Hennessey-Fiske, her paper's Houston bureau chief, does not speak about on his impending extradition to California, but touches on various topics of conversation related to Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In sloppy handwritten text with grammar mistakes, Durst spoke about places he lived in the city 'part-time' from 2008 to 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said he 'hated LA traffic, which makes Houston look like a small town' before going on to say that his interests are 'opera and pro football'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Durst began the letter with an apparent mixing up of Hennesey-Fiske's first name by writing 'Hiya Holly'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Durst (right) was long thought to be involved in the murder of his friend and confidante Susan Berman (left) before his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He blamed the lack of football in LA on 'politicos and business leaders' who 'have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The suspect said that he liked the L.A. Opera, with the exception of 19th century German composer Richard Wagner's The Ring Cycle, a 15-hour, three part show based on Norse legend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Durst said that he disliked the 'absurd costumes and sloped stage, a true example of Hollywood gone berserk'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The letter also gives information about the elderly man's health, and said that he moved from California to Texas to 'let some guy drill into my head' during surgery for what he says is hydrocephalus, water on the brain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Last year Durst had a shunt on the his head to drain water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Evidence that came to light during the filming of HBO's The Jinx shows similar handwriting to the 'cadaver' letter on an envelope sent to Berman before her death (left).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He also asked to be 'copied' if any of the information from his letter to Hennessey-Fiske was published.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The millionaire, who gained $65 million from a court settlement with his family over his inheritance, was arrested in mid-March at a hotel in New Orleans after leaving his home in Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>His life and criminal trials have gained more attention after he was the subject of an HBO documentary series called The Jinx, which delved into the Berman killing as well as two other deaths to which he is connected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Many observers think that the heir also played a role in the disappearance of his wife Kathleen McCormack in 1982 and have speculated that he killed his confidante Berman so that she did not reveal any information to police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He was found not guilty in 2003 of killing a man who was his neighbor at Galveston, Texas, house where Durst was living and pretending to be a mute woman named Dorothy Ciner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Durst admitted to chopping up the body of the Texas man, Morris Black, and dumping into Galveston Bay, but said the killing was in self-defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Jinx captured footage of Durst allegedly admitting to himself that he killed all three people while wearing a still-live microphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>'Killed them all,' he said while in the bathroom after an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Durst was recently indicted on weapons charges for the revolver found in his New Orleans hotel room, a development that will most likely delay his extradition to California for the Berman trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He is currently staying in the mental ward of state prison and is being held without bail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>As a convicted felon he is barred from owning a gun in Louisiana, but pleaded not guilty to the charges on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He is also charged with having a gun while in possession of five ounces marijuana and faces up to 30 years in prison in addition to federal firearms charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The arrest in the Berman case, in which Durst was long thought to have played a part, came after new evidence from the victim's stepson was shown as part of the HBO series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The final episode of the Jinx ran the day after Durst was arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>An episode also focused on a letter to Berman from Durst obtained by Berman's stepson Sareb Kaufman, where the handwriting matched a message to police alerting them of the writer's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Initial Los Angeles Police investigations into the 'cadaver' letter believed that Berman's manager Nyle Brenner wrote the message, according to the New York Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>However the handwriting matches the letter from Kaufman, who is mentioned in Durst's recent letter to Hennessey-Fiske as his broker for an apartment deal, and contained the same spelling mistake of Beverly Hills as 'Beverley Hills'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Durst's lawyer Mr DeGuerin told the Los Angeles Times that the handwriting appeared authentic, but 'It certainly doesn't look like the cadaver letter'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The similarities between Durst's previous correspondence and the anonymous letter sent to the Beverly Hills police is expected to play a role in his trial in California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Durst ends his letter to Hennessey-Fiske by saying that she is probably aware of her ability to visit him once he returns to Los Angeles.</td></tr>
