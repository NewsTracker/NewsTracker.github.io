<h3>Investigators Find Body Parts From All 150 Germanwings Victims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Investigators have found and studied 2,854 body parts, Marseille Prosecutor Brice Robin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But he said it will still take a long time for investigators to match the body parts with DNA samples from families of the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Robin also gave details about the discovery of the second black box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said it was found by a gendarme buried on the left side of a ravine "already explored several times."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He described the flight data recorder as "completely blackened" as though it had been burned, but said it was "possibly usable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Robin said 40 cellphones had been found at that crash site in a "very, very damaged" condition, without referring to the reports by Paris Match and Bild that footage of the final moments of the crash had been recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In Germany, prosecutors said the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 appears to have researched suicide methods and cockpit door security in the days before he crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing everyone aboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Search terms found on a tablet computer at co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's apartment in Duesseldorf provided the first evidence that his actions may have been premeditated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Based on information from the cockpit voice recorder, investigators believe Lubitz, 27, locked his captain out of the Airbus A320 cockpit on March 24 and deliberately slammed the plane into a French mountain.</td></tr>
