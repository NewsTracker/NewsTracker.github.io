<h3>Greek debt crisis: Banks due to reopen on Monday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Athens: The acute economic crisis that has gripped Greece for weeks has eased markedly as European officials dismantled key obstacles to desperately needed loans and the country's banks prepared to reopen Monday, three weeks after locking their doors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The unusually positive signals came hours after Greece's parliament reluctantly approved austerity measures required as a condition of a $US96 billion ($130 billion) bailout deal, the country's third financial rescue in five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The agreement split the country's ruling party, with the prime minister warning that the stringent measures would unleash new pain on a population already suffering from the worst downturn in any developed nation since World War II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But parliament's endorsement won rare praise from European creditors and gave them a reason to lift - at least for now - the threat of economic oblivion that has hung over Greece for nearly a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The most tangible sign of reprieve is set to come on Monday, when Greek banks are scheduled to open for the first time since June 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas told state television: "All bank branches will be open".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The reopening would ease but not eliminate the hardship that Greeks have endured for weeks as their banking system flirted with ruin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greeks would still be limited to withdrawing 60 euros ($88) a day from their accounts but they would not need to line up at ATMs every day to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Instead, the daily limit would be cumulative, meaning savers could wait a week and withdraw seven days' worth of cash in one go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Stringent controls on transfers of money abroad are expected to remain, leaving in place a measure that has choked imports and led to shortages of certain foods and medicines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The path to a reopening was cleared after the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it would offer Greek lenders an additional $US980 million in aid, giving them critical breathing room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In other signs of a thaw after months of bitter deadlock, euro-zone finance ministers announced they were ready to begin technical negotiations on the details of the broader bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That process could take several weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the meantime, they signalled that they have found a way to provide Greece with the short-term loans needed to cover its most pressing debts, including a Monday payment due to the ECB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, said he expected that Greece would get the aid it needs in time to pay its $US3.8 billion tab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Only days ago, Greece was confronted with the threat of a euro-zone exit if it missed that crucial deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But in a midday news conference, Mr Draghi suggested that Greece's membership in the currency club was no longer in doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Our mandate is to act based on the assumption that Greece is and will be a member of the euro area," Mr Draghi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Not everyone was so bullish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In Finland, the government gave its backing to fresh loans for Greece, defying predictions that it could emerge as a hard-line holdout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But finance minister Alexander Stubb said creditors will be watching carefully to see if Greece actually implements the belt-tightening measures it has promised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We need the political will of the Greek government, which still seems to be a little bit lacking," Mr Stubb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The prime minister says that he doesn't actually believe in the program that we've been working on for so long."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Greece's leaders say there's good reason for that, accusing Europe's political heavyweights of using economic blackmail to try to force the country's radical leftist government from office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Even with the bailout deal solidifying, the Greek government's position remains highly precarious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras won parliamentary support for the agreement in the wee hours of Thursday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But it came at a heavy cost to his own party, Syriza, with dozens of members bucking his will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mr Tsipras had to rely on his political opponents to ram the measure through Parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The mutiny confronted Mr Tsipras with hard choices over how to handle his one-time allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He huddled with top advisers for hours on Thursday evening amid reports that he was preparing to purge the dissidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That didn't happen, but it still could in the coming days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mr Tsipras will ultimately have to decide whether to try to muddle along with a fractured government, reach out to his opponents to forge a broader coalition or resign and call new elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In the strongest signal yet that that last option is a real prospect, Greece's interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, predicted in a radio interview that a new vote could be held as early as September - just nine months after Syriza came to power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis played down expectations that new elections could come even sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>While acknowledging a "notable breach" in party unity, he said Mr Tsipras would not step down before he finalises the bailout deal with creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"The main priority of the prime minister and the government is to successfully conclude the agreement," he said.</td></tr>
