<h3>Greek leader meets creditors, seeks bailout breakthrough</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, center right, shakes hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, center left, at the start of a round table meeting at the EU-CELAC summit in Brussels on Wednesday, June 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece's prime minister was hoping to meet with the leaders of Germany and France in Brussels Wednesday, in the latest effort to break a bailout negotiation deadlock that has revived fears his country could default and drop out of the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras reinforced his diplomatic offensive on Wednesday to try to convince European creditors to pay out the bailout loans the country needs to avoid default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The creditors have made it clear that Greece has to improve its offer of economic reforms before they release 7.2 billion euros ($8.1 billion) the country needs to pay debts due at the end of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tsipras had a short meeting with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and another with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande that lasted into early Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He planned to continue talks with Juncker on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We decided to intensify the effort to bridge the remaining differences and proceed - I think will proceed - to a solution," Tsipras said after the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Wednesday's talks came after Juncker's European Commission had said the offers made by Greece last week were still not good enough to unlock the bailout funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"For this final push, the Commission is of the view that the ball is clearly now in the court of the Greek government," Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With the onus firmly on Greece and options increasingly limited, Standard & Poor's in New York downgraded Greece's credit rating 1 notch further into junk territory, saying it's likely the country will default on its commercial debt within a year if it can't strike a deal with its creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The ratings agency said Greece has shown it is giving higher priority to its pensions and other domestic spending than making debt payments on time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>S&P lowered Greece's rating to "CCC" from "CCC+" with a "negative" outlook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Finance ministers from the 19 nations using the euro currency will meet in Luxembourg next week with the Greek deadline for payment ever closer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The lack of visible progress in the negotiations over the past weeks has revived fears Greece could default on its debts and drop out of the euro, a move that would create huge uncertainty for Europe and global markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The goal is to keep Greece in the eurozone," Merkel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Where there is a will, there is a way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Yet she insisted it was up to Tsipras first and foremost to show that willingness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Greece has three weeks left to conclude a deal with its creditors before its bailout program expires at the end of the month, when it will also have to repay about 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We must be quick. We must not let things drag out," Hollande said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Tsipras insisted not only Greece was at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We must find a solution that will give Greece the opportunity to safely return to growth and a sustainable debt - on a course that will bring back security and stability not just to Greece but all of Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Athens is at odds with its creditors over what reforms Greece must make in return for the bailout loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Each side has submitted its own proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But talks have been deadlocked since Athens rejected the creditors' suggestions as irrational last Friday, saying they would make life harder for Greeks already reeling from five years of deep spending cuts and soaring unemployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>European Commission vice president Vladis Dombrovskis stressed the importance of agreeing on overall targets for Greece's primary surplus - the budget excluding debt and interest payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Athens has been arguing for lower primary surpluses than creditors demand, saying that insisting on high primary surpluses curtails the amount of funds that can be spent on the country and causes unnecessary hardship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Minister of State Alekos Flambouraris, a close aide to Tsipras, told Alpha television that primary surplus being demanded by lenders is now 1 percent, and that Greece wants 0.75.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He said Greece could settle at 0.85 and said it should be linked to further debt restructuring.</td></tr>
