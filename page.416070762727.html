<h3>Ferguson election triples number of blacks on City Council</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two black candidates were among three people elected to the Ferguson City Council Tuesday, tripling African-American representation in the St. Louis suburb where poor race relations have been a focal point since the August shooting death of an 18-year-old black by a white police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The election means that half of the six-member city council in Ferguson, a town where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black, will now be African-American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The lone black incumbent councilman was not up for re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The mayor, who could break any tie votes, is white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Voter turnout increased substantially from the previous election following a strong get-out-the-vote effort from labor unions and other national organizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The town that drew only 12.3 percent of registered voters last April had 29.4 percent turnout Tuesday, according to the St. Louis County Board of Elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That was about double the overall turnout in St. Louis County, where Ferguson is located.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Unofficial results showed that Wesley Bell defeated another black candidate to win in the 3rd Ward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ella Jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in the 1st Ward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who is white, won a 2nd Ward race against another white candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard," said councilman-elect Bell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was the first municipal election in Ferguson since officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The shooting sparked sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis area, and spawned a national "Black Lives Matter" movement to press for change in how police deal with local minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It also prompted a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which decided not to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But the federal department released a scathing report blasting the city for racial bias and profiling in the police department and a profit-driven municipal court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The new city council will be tasked with approving hiring of the replacements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The scrutiny in the wake of the shooting also found that the city had a mostly white police force and city leadership - the mayor also is white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In the race for the 3rd Ward, which includes the apartment complex where Brown was killed, Bell, 40, easily defeated 76-year-old retiree Lee Smith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Bell is a lawyer and a criminology professor who had to defend himself because of a third job - municipal judge in a neighboring town of Velda City that, like Ferguson, derives a large percentage of its budget from municipal court fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Smith had support of several national organizations whose volunteers went door-to-door on his behalf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Jones had support of a labor union and won easily in her four-person race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Fletcher, the former mayor who started the "I Love Ferguson" campaign after the unrest that ravaged the community, also won easily in the 2nd Ward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A strong push was made after the shooting to register more black voters last year, but just 562 new voters were added to the rolls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In recent weeks, the focus has been on getting those who are registered to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The high turnout came despite brutal weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Strong storms, including lightning and heavy rain, tore through the region for several hours before noon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But the weather didn't deter Marty Einig, who has participated in Ferguson protests since August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>She was voting in the 3rd Ward, which includes the Canfield Green apartment complex where Brown was fatally shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I see there is raw material within this community to demonstrate hope," Einig said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I see a glass that's half full, and I feel that the people have the will to force change."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Charrolynn Washington agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Voting at the First Presbyterian Church of Ferguson, she said the election is where real change will occur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"As much change is needed here in Ferguson, this is where we begin - not out there in the streets, doing what they were doing - but, right here," Washington said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"They need to be voting and putting people in position to make the change and make the decisions that need to be made."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 2 city council candidate Bob Hudgins poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The city is preparing for an election on Tuesday when three of six city council seats will be decided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 3 city council candidate Lee Smith poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 3 city council candidate Wesley Bell poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 1 city council candidate Ella Jones poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 1 city council candidate Doyle McClellan poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 1 city council candidate Mike McGrath poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 2 city council candidate Brian Fletcher poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Rich Baranowski, second from left, and Tracy Hardy, second from right, vote as poll workers sit nearby during Ferguson's municipal election Tuesday, April 7, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Three of the six city council seats are up for grabs in the St. Louis County town where 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black, was fatally shot by a white Ferguson police officer in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Voters head to the polls in a municipal election Tuesday, April 7, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
