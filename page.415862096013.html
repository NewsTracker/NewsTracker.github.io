<h3>Clueless Teens Cheer Enthusiastically for Robert Durst</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Robert Durst!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Billy Eichner, the comedian best known for his show Billy on the Street, appeared at the I Heart Radio Awards last night and whipped the crowd into a frenzy ... about wealthy murder suspect Bob Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>During the show, Eichner got the teens in the audience to agree to play a game: He would shout out the name of someone famous who was attending the awards, and the teens would cheer loudly to show how excited they were to have them there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Rihanna!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The teens scream.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Sam Smith!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The teens scream louder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Robert Durst!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Oops, the teens also scream.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Somebody tell the writers at Pretty Little Liars to work a Durst reference into the show, or else the teens will never find out about him.</td></tr>
