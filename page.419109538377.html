<h3>Facebook's new live video streaming - how it stacks up</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook's new live streaming app lets users connect with celebrities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook has joined the live-stream-video scene - but so far, it's only for famous people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The service allows users to broadcast an event and viewers to comment as they're watching, similar to other live video apps like Periscope.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But there are some key differences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The video is streamed through Facebook Mentions, which is available only to public figures with verified Facebook pages as a way to manage interactions with fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And users can catch the video later if they miss the live version, unlike Snapchat and Periscope, which both delete public videos after 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook is joining a competitive market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Periscope is owned by Twitter and reported one million users in the first 10 days after its opening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Snapchat's curated streams, known as Live Stories, receive an average of 10 to 20 million viewers, Shannon Kelly, a spokeswoman for Snapchat, wrote in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>So in the world of live streaming, how does one choose?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Use Facebook if: You want to watch Lindsey Vonn ski down a mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Or listen to a new track from Luke Bryan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Or see the NBC newsroom from the perspective of Lester Holt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Perks: Watching celebrities pretend to be real is fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Downside: It's not available to the masses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Use Periscope if: You want to get a virtual guitar lesson from John Mayer as much as you want to watch a stranger tour his or her city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Perks: Anyone can broadcast, and it's easy to share the stream on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Downside: Videos are deleted after 24 hours unless you save them on your phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Use Snapchat if: You want to see a collection of edited clips from a range of users at popular events, such as the Lollapalooza music festival and the Quidditch World Cup, or unique locations, like the world's largest mosque.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Perks: Multiple clips means multiple perspectives, and anyone at the event or location can contribute (although that doesn't guarantee it will appear in the feed).</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Downside: The stream isn't necessarily in real time, Ms. Kelly, the spokeswoman, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>There is a lag of about an hour between the time users submit a video and the time editors add that clip to the story.</td></tr>
