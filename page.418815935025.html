<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EL-ARISH, Egypt (AP) - Officials in Egypt say a roadside bombing in the country's restive Sinai Peninsula has wounded 18 police conscripts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Security officials say the blast Sunday morning targeted a bus carrying the conscripts in El-Arish as they traveled along a seafront road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hospital officials confirmed the casualty figure and said none of those hurt had life-threatening wounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to discuss the attack with journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The bombing is just the latest assault to target security forces in the Sinai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Government forces have been carrying out an intensified hunt for Islamic militants in several northern Sinai towns.</td></tr>
