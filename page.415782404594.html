<h3>Feds: Baltimore jail illegally keeping juveniles in solitary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - The U.S. Justice Department says teenagers awaiting trial on adult charges in Baltimore are being kept in solitary confinement for far too long - up to 143 days in one case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The department's civil rights attorneys say being isolated for so long can damage a person's mental health - especially with teenagers whose brains are still developing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The State of Maryland says juvenile detainees accused of breaking jail rules should spend no longer than a week in solitary, and yet teenagers inside the Baltimore City Detention Center are being isolated for 13 days on average, and in some cases, far longer.</td></tr>
