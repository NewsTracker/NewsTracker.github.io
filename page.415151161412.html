<h3>Iraq's Tikrit: A Sunni bastion on the road to Mosul</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The hometown of Saddam Hussein, Tikrit is on the main highway from Baghdad to Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which is also held by the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Retaking Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling the Islamic State group, but the entry of thousands of Shiite militiamen into the Sunni city could aggravate tensions and severely test the government's ability to suture the country's sectarian wounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Here are a few quick facts about Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>STRATEGIC LOCATION: Tikrit is at the intersection of the main highway leading from Baghdad to Mosul and another key road to the northern oil hub of Kirkuk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Iraqi forces halted the Islamic State advance outside the town of Samarra to the south of Tikrit last summer and recaptured the Beiji oil refinery town to the north in November, allowing it to potentially attack from two sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Capturing Tikrit would further secure the vital north-south supply route ahead of an attempt to retake Mosul, which U.S. officials have said could come as soon as April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>SYMBOLIC VALUE: Tikrit is the hometown of Saddam Hussein, whose Sunni-dominated dictatorship ruled Iraq for more than two decades before it was toppled by the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Since then the Sunni minority has felt increasingly marginalized by the Shiite majority and the Shiite-led government in Baghdad, and in 2006 long-running tensions boiled over into sectarian violence that claimed tens of thousands of lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Islamic State was able to rally Sunni support by portraying its advance as a "revolution" against the Shiite-led government and security forces, and Tikrit fell in a matter of days last June as the security forces crumbled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The army today is backed by tens of thousands of Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen, who have proven effective in the battlefield but have been accused by rights groups of terrorizing Sunni civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The brutality displayed by the Islamic State group far exceeds that of the Shiite fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It was in Tikrit where Islamic State extremists massacred hundreds of captured Iraqi soldiers last summer, later publishing pictures of the mass killing online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But it's unclear whether Iraqis in the country's Sunni heartland see the Shiite-led government as a better alternative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS: The Iraqi army can approach Tikrit from the north and south, and still controls a massive army base on the town's outskirts known as Camp Speicher by the American troops who were once stationed there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But a number of attempts to retake the city last summer failed, and it's not clear to what extent Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has rooted out corruption and incompetence in the security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even if they drive out the Islamic State militants, the Iraqi army and its Shiite allies are unlikely to be able to secure Tikrit without the support of powerful Sunni tribes, many of which deeply distrust the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Iraqi state TV says Sunni fighters are taking part in the offensive, and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has promised amnesty for tribal fighters who break with the extremists, calling it their "last chance" to ally with the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Just how many have heeded that call is not yet known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>LONG ROAD TO MOSUL: Capturing Tikrit would mark a major victory for the Iraqi army and the U.S.-led coalition that has been carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State group since last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But the road to Mosul extends another 150 miles (250 kilometers) to the north, and the Islamic State group still controls much of the vast Anbar province to the west.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Any pro-government forces stationed in Tikrit would likely be targeted by suicide bombings and other attacks, and securing the city could divert much-needed forces from any eventual push toward Mosul.</td></tr>

<h3>Teen basketball player with brain tumor raises $1.4 million for cancer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Over the past several months, Hill has helped raise an astounding $1.4 million to help fund research to fight cancers like hers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"For Lauren, it's not about her - it's about the 'homerun' cure," said Jen Gault, public relations and marketing coordinator for The Cure Starts Now Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"As she has mentioned in countless interviews, she is aware that her efforts will not save her life, but will help the next child diagnosed with this deadly cancer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hill had dropped out of sight for the last week or so to recharge, according to posts by her family on the Facebook page dedicated to Lauren's fundraising efforts, "Lauren's Fight for Cure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We have been laying low as Lauren has been more tired the last couple days," her mom wrote, adding that even Lauren was surprised that she has survived so much longer than doctors originally predicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On February 6, Mount St. Joseph honored Lauren's accomplishments with the Doctor of Humane Letters degree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And the women's basketball team held its annual banquet at Cincinnati Children's Hospital to share the celebration with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One of the sustaining factors has been Lauren's bond with her team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"She loves her teammates," Lisa Hill wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They are family. She is so thankful they have been a part of this journey to spread awareness about DIPG. Thanks to everyone for the continued prayers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>When they learned Lauren wasn't well enough to travel to the annual team banquet, her teammates found the perfect solution: On Tuesday night, they brought the celebration to her at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The same night, Ohio Governor John Kasich gave Hill a Courage Award during the annual State of the State address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A member of The Cure Starts Now collected the award for Lauren.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Over a year ago, Hill was diagnosed with DIPG (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma), a cancer of the brainstem that primarily affects children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The diagnosis stunned the young athlete, but her first question wasn't about her illness - it was about her future as a college athlete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Can I still play basketball?" she asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The tumor continued to grow and by fall of 2014, doctors were telling the Hill family that Lauren might only have weeks left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Hoping to help make her dream of playing college basketball come true, Hill's coach went to the NCAA to ask for an exemption from the rule stipulating that games not start until mid-November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The NCAA agreed to move the game up to Nov. 2 and to allow it to be played at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Nobody ever knows how much time you have left," Lauren told WLWT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I could be gone tomorrow or I could be here for another year. Why stop? Why give up on your life?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Hill not only got to play in the game, but she scored two layups, which helped her team win the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>With the season over, Hill is focused on the drive to raise more dollars for DIPG research, which she hopes will lead to a much broader cancer solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"She believes, just as researchers around the world agree, that by focusing on those cancers, such as DIPG, that force us to innovate we'll discover new strategies to help cure all cancer," Gault said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"She continues to inspire people all around the world."</td></tr>
