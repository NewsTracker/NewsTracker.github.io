<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Formula one drivers and family members stand in front of the casket of French Formula One driver Jules Bianchi into Sainte Reparate Cathedral during his funeral in Nice, French Riviera, Tuesday, July 21, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>The championship tussle between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will take a back seat at the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend, with Formula One still coming to terms with the death of Jules Bianchi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 25-year-old Bianchi died in a hospital in his hometown of Nice on Friday from injuries sustained in a head-on crash during the Japanese GP last October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The outpouring of sympathy and support for Bianchi's family reflected just how popular he was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was also highly rated, and made enough of an impression in his 34 GPs for many observers to predict he would be a future star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bianchi had been expected to replace Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hamilton, Rosberg, Brazilian driver Felipe Massa and French driver Romain Grosjean attended Bianchi's funeral at the Sainte Reparate Cathedral in Nice on Tuesday, along with four-time F1 champions Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel and FIA president Jean Todt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Saying goodbye to Jules was incredibly hard for everyone," Hamilton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"For myself, I wished I had known him better. But from what I knew of him, he was a kind heart with a great spirit and a bright future."</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>In rainy, gloomy conditions, his car slid off the track and ploughed into a crane picking up the Sauber of German driver Adrian Sutil, who crashed one lap earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The accident prompted F1 to alter its rules, allowing a "virtual safety car" in which stewards can neutralize a race, forcing all cars to proceed slowly into the pit lane rather than continuing to lap the circuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The start times of some races were also moved forward to avoid them continuing in dim light conditions.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>"I know he'd want us to race hard as he did, and so I will."</td></tr>
