<h3>U.S. says Russia adds air defense systems inside Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday accused Russia of building up air defense systems inside eastern Ukraine and of involvement in training exercises of pro-Russian separatists in the area in breach of a European-brokered cease-fire agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"This is the highest amount of Russian air defense equipment in eastern Ukraine since August," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She said the increasingly complex nature of the training exercises "leaves no doubt that Russia is involved."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The training has also incorporated Russian UAV's (unmanned aerial vehicles), an unmistakable sign of Russian presence," Harf added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russia was also building up its forces along the Ukrainian border, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"After maintaining a relatively steady presence along the border, Russia is sending additional units there," Harf said, adding that the increase gave Russia its largest presence on the border since October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>More than 6,000 people have been killed since the conflict in eastern Ukraine erupted more than a year ago, when rebels opposed to the ousting of a Moscow-backed president and the installation of a pro-Western government declared independence from Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ukraine and its Western allies have long accused Moscow of sending troops and weapons to support the rebels, a charge Russia has denied.</td></tr>
