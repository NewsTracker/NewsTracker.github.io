<h3>US Marine helicopter missing in Nepal earthquake aid mission</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A U.S. military helicopter carrying six Marines and two Nepalese Army soldiers went missing during a mission in Nepal delivering aid to earthquake victims, U.S. defense officials said Tuesday, but so far there have been no indications that the aircraft crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. Army Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Steve Warren said an Indian helicopter in the air nearby at the time heard radio chatter from the Marine aircraft about a possible fuel problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said the Huey, carrying tarps and rice, had dropped off supplies in one location and was en route to a second site when contact was lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said officials are hopeful that the aircraft is simply missing because there has been no smoke or other signs of a crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Navy Capt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chris Sims says the Huey was conducting disaster relief operations near Charikot, Nepal, on Tuesday, around 9 a.m. EDT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Warren said a Nepalese air brigade unit had seen the Huey, so Marines in V-22 Osprey aircraft searched near that last known location for about 90 minute but found nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Because it's now dark, members of the Nepalese Army are conducting the search on foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Warren said they are moving toward the second aid location to see if the helicopter landed near there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Because of the rugged mountainous terrain, the helicopter could have landed in a low area but the Marines may not be able to get a beacon or radio signal out, Warren said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He added that U.S. airborne para-rescue forces have rehearsed rescue missions, and are ready to go if needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The aircraft is part of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469, and the incident is under investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There are about 300 U.S. troops in Nepal assisting with the rescue mission, using a variety of aircraft including three Hueys, four Ospreys and several cargo planes.</td></tr>
