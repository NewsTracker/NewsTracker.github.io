<h3>Probe Into Role Of Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez In Cover-Up Moves Forward</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - The prosecutor who inherited a high-profile case against Argentine President Cristina Fernandez on Friday reaffirmed the accusations, formally renewing the investigation into whether the president helped Iranian officials cover up their alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita's decision to go forward with the case was significant because it sets the stage for a close examination of the investigation that prosecutor Alberto Nisman was building before he was found dead Jan. 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The next day, Nisman was scheduled to elaborate his accusations to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nisman accused Fernandez, Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and others in her administration of brokering the cover-up in exchange for favorable deals on oil and other goods from Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fernandez and Timerman have strongly denied the accusations, and Iran has repeatedly denied involvement in the bombing, which killed 85 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In his statement released Friday afternoon, Pollicita recounted Nisman's accusations without providing analysis of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He concluded that an investigation is necessary to "achieve a degree of understanding to prove or disprove the factual and dogmatic extremes expressed in the preceding paragraphs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pollicita will present his findings to judge Daniel Rafecas, the federal magistrate assigned to the case who will ultimately decide whether to dismiss it or send it on to trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Even before Pollicita's decision, amid rumors that it was coming, the administration was moving to both reject and minimize it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Cabinet chief Jorge Capitanich called the move a "judicial coup" during his daily press briefing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The Argentine people should know that we're talking about a vulgar lie, of an enormous media operation, of a strategy of political destabilization and the biggest judicial coup d'etat in the history of Argentina to cover the real perpetrators of the crime," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Similarly, Presidential spokesman Anibal Fernandez said moving the case forward was a "clear maneuver to destabilize democracy" but that ultimately "it has no legal value. It does not matter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The strength of Nisman's 289-page investigation, presented to a judge a few days after his death, has been hot topic of debate within the legal community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The basis of his case are wiretaps of administration officials allegedly talking about a secret deal around the time of a 2013 "Memorandum of Understanding" that Argentina reached with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The agreement, which is being challenged in Argentine courts, on its face sets the conditions for the two countries to investigate the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Juan Jose Avila, a criminal lawyer, said arguing that Nisman's case wasn't strong enough misses the point because at this stage, no investigation is ready to be tried in court.</td></tr>

<h3>Fighting rages in Ukraine as clock ticks down to truce</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At least 27 civilians and soldiers died in shelling as German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Russia on Friday it risked fresh sanctions if the fighting did not stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With separatists fighting to conquer more territory ahead of the truce and Kiev forces digging in, there were also doubts about whether anyone would observe the midnight Sunday ceasefire vital to the success of the peace roadmap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The fresh fighting came after rebels and Kiev agreed to the wide-ranging plan on Thursday after marathon talks in the Belarussian capital Minsk between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ukraine's deputy defence minister Petro Mekhed accused the rebels of wanting to "raise their flag" over railway hub Debaltseve, scene of the bitterest recent fighting, and strategic port Mariupol ahead of the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Ukraine is expecting an escalation and taking all necessary measures to be able to respond," Mekhed told journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fragile agreement was seen as the best hope of ending the conflict, which has killed at least 5480 people, but scepticism remains high after the collapse of a similar previous peace plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I don't want anyone to have any illusions or to seem like I'm naive - there is still an awful long way to go to peace," Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko told troops near Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Nobody is absolutely certain that the conditions for peace signed in Minsk will be fulfilled."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini hailed the signing of the roadmap as "a first result".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The first step is the ceasefire tomorrow evening and we'll verify that on the ground," she said in Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both sides are supposed to begin pulling back heavy weaponry from along the frontline no later than two day after that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ukraine's military said that fighting remained fiercest around Debaltseve, with rebels firing missiles at the beleaguered railway hub mid-way between the main separatist bastions of Donetsk and Luhansk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>An AFP journalist in the rebel capital of Donetsk said that sporadic missile salvos and dozens of artillery bombardments could be heard around the city early Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The United States, which has said it could supply Ukraine with weapons if the conflict continues, cautiously welcomed the peace accord, but emphasised the work yet to be done in making it stick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The true test of today's accord will be in its full and unambiguous implementation," the White House said, including "restoration of Ukrainian control over its border with Russia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Under the new accord, Kiev will begin retaking control over the approximately 400 kilometres stretch of Russia's border with rebel-held Ukraine, but only after local elections are held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Separatist-held territories will be granted a degree of autonomy to be established through talks, and the right to decide which language they use.</td></tr>
