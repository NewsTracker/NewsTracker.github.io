<h3>Facebook said in talks with publishers on hosting content</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The plan would be a shift in the relationship between the world's biggest social-networking service and media outlets, which use Facebook to drive traffic to their sites and help boost revenue from online advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook is proposing that publishers post directly to its platform, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook is in talks with the New York Times, BuzzFeed and National Geographic about hosting their articles or videos directly on the social network, the New York Times reported Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In February, the Times said it nominated Rebecca Van Dyck, global head of consumer and brand marketing at Facebook, to join its board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FILE - This June 11, 2014 file photo shows Facebook's "like" symbol at the entrance to the company's campus in Menlo Park, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Facebook has been working to increase the quality of the news content on its feed, weeding out posts that it deems to be click bait or link bait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Menlo Park, California-based company has also been emphasizing news with partnerships for its Paper application, a magazine-style Facebook experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meanwhile, publishers are eager to get their stories to appear on its News Feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last month, Facebook's chief product officer, Chris Cox, said at a media conference that the social network had early conversations with publishers about hosting their content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Their concern is lack of control, Cox added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Reading news on a smartphone is still a very bad experience most of the time," Cox said at the Code/Media conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We want to try and make that a better experience for publishers."</td></tr>
