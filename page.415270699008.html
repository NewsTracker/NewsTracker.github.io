<h3>Michigan film incentive program under scrutiny once again</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - Michigan's film incentive program is being scrutinized in Lansing yet again in the midst of a larger debate about how to cut costs and pay for increased liabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A House committee voted Wednesday to approve a bill that would stop the film incentive program, which gives money to movie, TV and digital productions in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bill sponsored by Republican Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dan Lauwers of Brockway would end the program Oct. 1, at the end of the current fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gov. Rick Snyder proposed $50 million for the program in the next fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But with recent announcements of the state's increased liabilities for business tax credits, estimated at $9.4 billion over the next two decades, legislators are looking at ways to cut costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The film incentives are a prime target for House Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It seems to me this will be the easiest $50 million you'll find," Lauwers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lauwers and others who want to end the film incentives say the program isn't justified when the state has other liabilities looming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jeff Farrington, chairman of the House Tax Policy Committee that recently approved moving Lauwer's bill to the full House, has long criticized the program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This thing is a total waste of taxpayer money, and I can't wait to get rid of it," the third-term Republican from Utica said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More than 30 other states offer film incentives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Opponents of the program liken it to an unwinnable arms race for the film industry's attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the competition among states offering incentives is part of why Michigan needs to keep its program, supporters say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Film industry workers, including members of Teamsters Local 337 from Detroit, testified in a committee hearing that Michigan has built a good reputation in the industry, and now is not the time to eliminate the incentives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The program is not just supporting out-of-state productions that come in, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Reports from the Michigan Film Office show the program supports many Michigan-based filmmakers, TV shows, and digital media productions, including video game development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Those reports also show productions receiving incentives supported about 1,000 jobs in the state during the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Productions in 2011 spent an estimated $202 million in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Former Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville championed film incentives during his tenure, which ended in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He led the way in extending the program for another seven years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That extension included several tweaks to the structure, but House Republicans included in their 2015 action plan that they would revisit whether the incentives are worth keeping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The bill ending the incentives could move through the House in the next week, though it is unclear whether it will advance any further as it is currently written.</td></tr>
