<h3>Islamic State militants attack Christian villages in Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BEIRUT -- Islamic State militants attacked a string of predominantly Christian villages in northeastern Syria on Saturday, touching off heavy clashes with Kurdish militiamen and their local allies, activists said.</td></tr>
