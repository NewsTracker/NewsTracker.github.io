<tr><td>2</td><td>CINCINNATI (AP) -- Matt Adams' first hit sent the Cincinnati Reds to their first loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The St. Louis first baseman snapped a hitless start to the season at 10 at-bats with a leadoff homer in the fourth inning, lifting the Cardinals to a 4-1 victory Saturday that ended the Reds' winning streak at four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I got to the park early, and my early work felt good,'' said Adams, who was robbed of a hit in the second inning on a diving catch by left fielder Marlon Byrd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It carried over into the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kolten Wong had a sacrifice fly, Jhonny Peralta and Yadier Molina added ninth-inning RBI singles and Michael Wacha pitched into the seventh to get the win in his first appearance of the season.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>He stranded a runner in scoring position in each of his last four full innings and needed just 76 pitches to earn the win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''That team over there is very aggressive early in the count,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Reds left five runners in scoring position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cincinnati's fourth-through-eighth batters are hitting .200 or less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''We didn't have much going on offense, but it was a close game until the end,'' manager Bryan Price said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Trevor Rosenthal, the Cardinals' fifth relief pitcher, got five outs for his second save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Adams led off the fourth inning by lofting a one-strike pitch 355 feet down the right-field line and on to the netting above the visitors' bullpen to give St. Louis a 2-1 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That was the only earned run allowed by Reds starter Johnny Cueto in 14 innings this season - a 0.64 ERA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Cueto (0-1), who turned in seven shutout innings without a decision in Cincinnati's 5-2 win over Pittsburgh in Monday's opener, again went seven, giving up four hits and two runs with four strikeouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He also hit a batter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Frazier, before a sellout crowd of 41,525 on his bobblehead day, gave Cincinnati the lead with his third home run of the season, a 342-foot drive into the seats down the left-field line on a 3-0 pitch with two outs in the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Cardinals tied it by loading the bases with one out on Frazier's error of Peralta's sharp one-hopper - Cincinnati's first error of the season - a hit batsman and Molina's single, setting up Wong's tying sacrifice fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Molina's hit was his first in 11 at-bats.</td></tr>
