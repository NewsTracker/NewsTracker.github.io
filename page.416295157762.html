<tr><td>12</td><td>Stanton hit his first home run since a fastball to the face ended his season last September.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>''I'll enjoy it later,'' Stanton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Suzuki made a pair of headfirst dives home on the same play, eluding catcher Travis d'Arnaud to make it 5-all in the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On third after a pinch-hit triple, he took off on an infield grounder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>D'Arnaud caught a wide throw, and both he and Suzuki made a dive for the plate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Suzuki missed the plate by an inch and d'Arnaud missed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Still spry at 41, Suzuki lunged with his hand and beat the tag by a split-second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Originally called out, Suzuki was ruled safe after a replay review that took 5 minutes, 44 seconds.</td></tr>

<tr><td>30</td><td>Collins also made his first replay challenge this season and won, with Realmuto losing an infield hit in the fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mets starter Dillon Gee struck out seven in 5 2-3 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He's pitched at least five innings in 48 straight starts, the longest active streak in the majors and two short of the team record held by Dwight Gooden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Marlins: Yelich returned to the lineup after missing two games because of back tightness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>... RHP Henderson Alvarez (inflammation in shoulder and elbow) is expected to begin playing catch in the next few days.</td></tr>
