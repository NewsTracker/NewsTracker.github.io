<h3>Crater wall collapse sends lava, debris spewing into the air on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HONOLULU - Molten lava and rocks went flying through the air on Hawaii's Kilauea (kih-luh-WAY'-uh) volcano after an explosion caused by the partial collapse of a crater wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory says the collapse Sunday triggered a small explosion, spreading lava and debris around the rim of the crater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The explosion happened on Kilauea's Halemaumau (hah-LE'-mah-oo-mah-oo) Crater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Video of the event shows a wall of rocks falling into a lava lake that has been rising over the past week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The USGS says fist-size chunks of rock were thrown onto the closed Halemaumau visitor overlook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The area has been closed since 2008 when the lava lake formed, and no one was injured.</td></tr>
