<tr><td>44</td><td>While it will be impossible to know what happened until the black boxes are analyzed, Sullenberger said the long descent time "suggests that at least to some extent the pilots were able to control the airplane."</td></tr>

<tr><td>46</td><td>The site is 430 miles south-southeast of Paris.</td></tr>

<tr><td>58</td><td>"At 11.30, I heard a series of loud noises in the air. There are often fighter jets flying over, so I thought it sounded just like that. I looked outside, but I couldn't see any fighter planes," he told the AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>"The noise I heard was long - like 8 seconds - as if the plane was going more slowly than a military plane. There was another long noise after about 30 seconds."</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Polizzi said the plane crashed about 3-to-11 miles from his place, which is closed for the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>"It's going to be very difficult to get there. The mountain is snowy and very hostile," he said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>72</td><td>The A320 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>The single-aisle, twin-engine jet is used to connect cities between one and five hours apart.</td></tr>
