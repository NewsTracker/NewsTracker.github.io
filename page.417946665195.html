<h3>Egypt Names Ambassador to Israel After Nearly 3 Years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt has named a new ambassador to Israel nearly three years after it had recalled the last one at the outset of the 2012 Israeli offensive in Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A statement released Sunday said President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi named ambassador Hazem Khairat as part of a regular reshuffle of Egypt's diplomatic corps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Khairat replaced Atef Salem Al-Ahl, who was in his post for less than a month in late 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Islamist President Mohammed Morsi recalled Al-Ahl to protest Israel's offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Morsi played a key role with the United States in negotiating a truce, making him the first Muslim Brotherhood leader to mediate between Israel and Gaza's Islamist rulers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>El-Sissi has kept good ties with Israel since he came to office after ousting Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Relations have been strained with Gaza's rulers.</td></tr>
