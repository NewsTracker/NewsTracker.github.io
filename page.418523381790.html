<h3>Iran nuclear deal: historic agreement in Vienna â€“ live updates</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a cable addressed to Khamenei, Sana said that Assad hailed the "great victory" achieved by Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Indubitably, this agreement crowns the steadfastness of the Iranian people, with all their components and inclinations, in the face of the unfair sanctions that were imposed on the Islamic Republic of Iran," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Assad said that the deal is "unequivocal recognition by the world countries of the peacefulness of the Iranian nuclear program," which will safeguard the national rights of Iran's people and allow it to asserts its sovereignty, according to Sana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are quite assured that the Islamic Republic of Iran will continue, with greater momentum, supporting the just issues of peoples and working for peace and stability to prevail in the region and the world," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Iran is a steadfast supporter of Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To make sure that the historic nuclear deal was sealed in Vienna, the Austrian government was willing to go all out to make the negotiators comfortable at the resplendent Palais Coburg hotel, including footing all their bills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Austrians made the country's trademark wafer biscuits and chocolate Mozart balls freely available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They hosted lavish brunches, and provided buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite the profusion of high-class local cuisine available, however, many of the delegations fell back on their own comfort foods to get them through the long days and nights of talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Iranians had green raisins and pistachios.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Americans got through more than 10lbs of strawberry flavoured Twizzlers, 20lbs of cheese strings, and 30lbs of mixed nuts and raisins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Each time the team of the British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, made a trip back to London, it returned to Vienna laden with biscuits from Marks & Spencer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At one point the French put that munificence to the test by staging a raid on the Coburg's famous wine cellars to find something special to have with dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Despite the comforts of the Coburg, the 18 days of talks were a gruelling challenge for the negotiators, most of whom were well over 60 years old and suffering from a variety of ailments as the talks went on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>To add to the discomfort, the heat of Vienna's summer surged, and it appeared to be beyond the capabilities of the hotel's air conditioning system to tame it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>We congratulate President Obama, Secretary Kerry and the other members of the P5+1 for having the resolve, determination, patience and persistence to bring such a difficult negotiation to a successful conclusion," J Street said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Following our own review of the agreement, we expect to call on Congress to support the deal as the best - if not only - means of ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons," J Street added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The agreement reached by world powers Tuesday to try to curb the Iranian nuclear program met with two very distinct reactions from 2016 US presidential candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Republicans greeted the deal with a chorus of condemnation while Democrats praised the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Republicans had long been wary of the nuclear negotiations with Iran, seeing Obama administration as weak negotiators who were ready to take "a bad deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, who launched his campaign Monday, said "President Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran will be remembered as one of America's worst diplomatic failures."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He was echoed by Florida senator Marco Rubio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Among Democrats, most backed the administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton said the deal was "an important step which puts a lid on Iran's nuclear programs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Vermont senator Bernie Sanders was even more positive about the deal on Tuesday, saying "[The deal] is a victory for diplomacy over saber-rattling and could keep the United States from being drawn into another never-ending war in the Middle East."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Senator Chuck Schumer, slated to become the next Senate Minority Leader, said he intends "to go through this agreement with a fine-tooth comb ... Supporting or opposing this agreement is not a decision to be made lightly, and I plan to carefully study the agreement before making an informed decision."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The outcome of the nuclear deal does not change Jason's cruel and illegal imprisonment for the past 356 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Jason is completely innocent of all charges and it is inhumane for him to still be held behind bars after nearly a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He was a journalist doing his job and today he should be reporting on the details of this agreement rather than being subjected to continued incarceration and delays in the judicial proceedings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>We remain appreciative of the ongoing efforts of the US Government behalf of Jason and the other Americans being held in Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>We are hopeful that with agreement now in place the Iranian courts will conclude this process swiftly and affirm Jason's innocence so we can bring him home and make our family whole once again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Iranian-American journalist is standing trial on charges of espionage and collaborating with hostile governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He appeared before a revolutionary court for the third time on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Rezaian is one of three Americans known to be held in Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I think this is an important step which puts a lid on Iran's nuclear programs. And it will enable us to then turn our attention as it must to doing what we can with our other partners in the region and beyond to try to prevent and contain Iran's other bad actions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"So all in all, we have to look at this seriously, evaluate it carefully but I believe based on what I know now that this is an important."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Meanwhile, the US speaker of the house John Boehner called the nuclear deal a "bad deal" that would provide billions of dollars of sanctions relief to Tehran and ultimately allow it to acquire nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But according to the Associated Press, in a news briefing Boehner insisted he has not prejudged the agreement but told Obama Tuesday morning that he was skeptical of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"We're going to do everything we can to get to the details and if in fact it's as bad a deal as I think it is at this moment, we're going to do everything we can to stop it," Boehner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Netanyahu has convened his security cabinet to discuss the Iran deal even as it was disclosed that President Barack Obama would be calling Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Despite that it is unclear what realistic leverage Netanyahu has so this may simply be a question of the Israeli prime minister going through the motions for the Israeli public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Netanyahu has now ended his short press conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>By not dismantling the nuclear program, the deal will give "an unrepentant" and "far richer" Iranian regime more regional power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"What a stunning historic mistake," Netanyahu says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Iran continues to seek Israel's destruction, Netanyahu says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Netanyahu references an incident from last Friday, when Iranian president Hassan Rouhani attended a rally where chants of "Death to America" and "Death to Israel".</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"This happened four days ago."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Netanyahu quotes Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah party, on sanctions relief for Iran: "A rich and strong Iran will be able to stand with its allies in the region."</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Netanyahu translates this as: Iran's support for terrorism and subversion will increase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"The world is a much more dangerous place," Netanyahu says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The deal gives Iran every incentive not to change, he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>In the coming decade, the deal will "reward the terrorist regime in Iran" with hundreds of millions of dollars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Netanyahu is speaking now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu preemtively condemned the agreement, calling it a "capitulation" and a mistake of historic proportions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>He is expected to address Israel shortly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>The Vienna agreement on Iran's nuclear programme will make the UN's nuclear watchdog agency the key arbiter of the deal, but can it succeed? asks Julian Borger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Related: Iran deal hands UN nuclear watchdog key role, but is it up to the job?</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Marco Rubios, another Republican presidential hopeful has expressed criticism of the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Dan Dfeiffer, a former Obama adviser, reckons that none of the Republican contenders would scrap deal if they were elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Paul Lewis has quick explanation on Obama's remarks in the context of what happens next in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>The Republican-dominated Congress could well formally express its disapproval of the Iran deal, but its ability to actually scupper the agreement is limited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Under the terms of an oversight process hatched between the White House and congressional leaders back in April, the president now has a few days to present the legislature with the terms of the agreement and associated documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>That kick-starts a 60-day review period, in which Obama administration officials will be grilled before Senate and House of Representatives committees over the fine-print.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>After that, there are 12 additional days for both chambers to pass a resolution to the president, and given that Republicans, who are highly sceptical of the deal, enjoy a majority in both chambers, it would not be surprising if that was a vote of disapproval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>A resolution condemning the agreement would be embarrassing for the president, but it would not in itself be enough to stop the president from waiving sanctions in return for Iran complying with the terms of the deal - the central mechanism in the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>For that, Congress would need to draft legislation to specifically undermine the agreement that would then need to pass with the two-thirds majority, in both the House and Senate, needed to overcome the presidential veto Obama has made clear today he would use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>That is a very high hurdle, even if a number of Democratic hawks defect to the Republican side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>In effect, Obama only needs to persuade a third of the legislature to back his deal, and his administration is likely to apply pressure on Democrats to preserve their president's legacy-defining agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>The International Crisis Group has welcomed the deal as the "best possible agreement".</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>and urges both the US Congress and Iranian Majlis to approve it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>But it also warns that the deal is no solution in itself to tension in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>It will not solve the region's many other problems, neither the proxy wars pitting Iran against its neighbours nor the hostility that still embitters Tehran's relations with the West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Indeed, in the short term at least, it is likely to reinforce the sense in regional capitals that Iran's star is ascending, which could exacerbate the clashes along regional fault lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Thus the achievement of this agreement, laudable in itself, is incomplete unless it prompts an effort by all the key stakeholders to secure a broader reduction in regional tensions with the goal of establishing an inclusive regional security framework.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Overcoming decades of animosity, both within the region and between Iran and the West, likely will prove even more challenging than reaching today's accord.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>But as the past two years of arduous talks have shown, even seemingly intractable predicaments can be addressed through persistent and patient diplomacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>The White House has turned to simple graphics to try to win over sceptics of the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>This is perhaps a response to Netanyahu's infamous bomb graphics at the UN which are now being mocked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Here's the full 14 minute video version of Obama's statement on the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Russia's president Vladimir Putin says the "world [has] heaved a sigh of relief".</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>We are satisfied that the solution found is based on the principle of phasing and mutuality which our country has been consistently supporting at every stage of these complicated negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>The comprehensive agreement rests on the solid foundation of international law, primarily the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the IAEA Safeguards, including the additional protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Despite the attempts to validate any scenarios based on the use of force, the parties to the negotiations made a choice in favour of stability and cooperation, which will be reflected in a corresponding UN Security Council resolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>We are grateful to all those who invariably supported efforts to find reliable political and diplomatic solutions to the Iranian issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>The Russian negotiating team and nuclear experts have made a significant expert contribution to the drafting of the comprehensive arrangements, which made it possible to align the different, often opposing views.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>The IAEA will carefully monitor the implementation of the agreed steps to prove the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Iran gets the opportunity to develop this programme, including uranium enrichment, under IAEA control and with the gradual lifting of sanctions imposed against Tehran, something we have long called for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>This is also important for the implementation of large-scale plans of peaceful nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran that got support in the documents approved today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>We expect that all the parties concerned, primarily the six states involved in the negotiations, will comply with the deal in full.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>The political will demonstrated by these six states and Iran in the course of these negotiations is a guarantee of the successful implementation of the plan of action designed for the long term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>Our bilateral relations with Iran will receive a new impetus and will no longer be influenced by external factors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Russia will do everything in its power to ensure the full implementation of the Vienna agreements, assisting in strengthening global and regional security, global nuclear non-proliferation, the creation in the Middle East of a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, and the mobilisation of a broad coalition in the region to counter terrorist threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Corker, a key figure in Congress, has expressed his doubts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>"Throughout these negotiations, I have expressed significant concerns to the administration about the crossing of red line after red line as we have moved from a goal of dismantling Iran's nuclear capabilities to managing its proliferation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>I want to read the agreement in detail and fully understand it, but I begin from a place of deep skepticism that the deal actually meets the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>In the coming days, Congress will need to scrutinize this deal and answer whether implementing the agreement is worth dismantling our painstakingly-constructed sanctions regime that took more than a decade to establish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Iran continues to be the lead sponsor of terrorism in the world and relieving sanctions would make the Tehran regime flush with cash and could create a more dangerous threat to the United States and its allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Without the passage of our bill [which seeks to prevent the president waiving sanctions on Iran], Congress would have had no role in reviewing and voting on an agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Once the president submits to Congress all of the documents associated with this deal, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will conduct a rigorous review during which time congressional sanctions will remain in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said the deal "empowers" Iran to carry out threats against Iran and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>In his speech about the deal President Rouhani made much of sanctions relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Rouhani's support rests on the assumption that an agreement would result in better access to foreign medical supplies, foreign investment and an improvement in living standards, according to a new poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Related: What's next for President Rouhani in Iran?</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>John Kerry said the implementation of the deal is more important than the text.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>"I'm not going to stand here and tell you every is going to work without a hitch," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>Iranian negotiators have repeatedly reassured the US that they have a full mandate from President Rouhani and the Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the US secretary of state said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>In answer to his final question he said: "We have put in ample mechanisms in respect to compliance. So I feel very confident about our ability to protect our interests."</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>He then apologised for not taking any more questions with reference to his broken leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>"You will have to forgive me. This is the longest I've stood up for quite a while," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>Julian Borger has more from John Perry's press conference in Vienna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>Iran's Press TV has footage of Kerry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond says the deal is the culmination of over a decade of complex negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>After more than a decade of tough negotiations we have reached an historic agreement that will impose strict limits and inspections on Iran's nuclear programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>Under the agreement, Iran will grant the International Atomic Energy Agency access to verify adherence to the restrictions placed on its nuclear programme, giving the international community confidence that the programme is, and will remain, exclusively peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>In return, once Iran has taken key steps to introduce these restrictions, the international community will lift some of its sanctions on Iran, delivering significant economic and financial benefits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>Having reached this important agreement, our focus will now be on its swift and full implementation to make sure that a nuclear weapon remains beyond Iran's reach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>We recognise the concern in the region about Iran's historic pattern of regional activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>We will maintain our clear position in support of the Gulf states and against Iranian interference in their internal affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>We hope, and expect, that this agreement will herald a step-change in Iran's relations with its neighbours and with the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>The removal, over time, of economic and financial sanctions represents a huge opportunity for Iranians to make positive decisions about their country's future and its role in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>We will continue to work closely with our international partners to encourage Iran to play a transparent and constructive role in regional affairs, particularly in the struggle against violent Islamist extremism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>The IAEA says the deal help inspectors verify whether Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>"I congratulate Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union for reaching this joint comprehensive agreement following many months of tireless negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>I welcome this agreement which will facilitate the IAEA's further verification work in Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>We will be asked to monitor and verify the nuclear-related measures set out in the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>I will then report to and consult the IAEA's Board of Governors on this request and on how to secure the necessary financial resources for the Agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>I am confident in our ability to do this important work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>The IAEA stands ready to undertake the necessary monitoring and verification activities when requested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>129</td><td>With respect to the clarification of outstanding issues related to the possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme, the IAEA and Iran have, earlier today, agreed a Road-map as part of the Framework for Cooperation between the Agency and Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>130</td><td>Under this Road-map, and with the cooperation of Iran, the IAEA will be able to establish an understanding of the whole picture concerning these issues and report our assessment to our Board of Governors by the end of the year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>131</td><td>Here's the full text of the agreement, pistachios and all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>132</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry has been giving his reaction to the deal in Vienna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>133</td><td>Despite its own conflicting economic interests, Moscow has played a key role in negotiating the nuclear deal and welcomed its results as a diplomatic victory, writes Alec Luhn in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>134</td><td>Russia's foreign ministry was waxing poetic on Tuesday as the deal was finalised, tweeting that negotiators were "preparing the final chord of the symphony" of Iran's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>135</td><td>Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists that the agreement "fully corresponds" with Russia's negotiating points, stressing that it would lift sanctions and recognise "Iran's right to peaceful nuclear activity," including enriching uranium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>136</td><td>The lifting of sanctions against Iran could make the easing of Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis also look more favourable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>137</td><td>Vice-speaker of parliament Nikolai Levichev told RIA Novosti that the signing of the deal marked a "victory of the diplomacy of negotiations over the diplomacy of sanctions and diktat".</td></tr>
<tr><td>138</td><td>Levichev also said trade between Iran and Russia would "increase significantly", especially in nanotechnology, machinery and agriculture, and could reach up to $10 billion a year after sanctions were lifted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>139</td><td>An eventual end to the arms embargo against Iran would also clearly be in the interest of Russia's $15bn arms industry, which makes most of its sales in Latin America and the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>140</td><td>Firmly in Iran's corner throughout the negotiation process, Moscow has argued that the embargo should be completely lifted so Iran can help fight the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>141</td><td>On the other hand, resumption of international trade with Tehran will almost surely mean a big increase in energy exports, positioning Iran to compete with Russia in its major energy markets of Turkey and Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>142</td><td>Russia's economy is already headed towards recession after being clobbered by low energy prices as well as sanctions, and the rouble fell slightly against the dollar after news of the Iran agreement broke on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>143</td><td>Julian Borger picks up the main points of the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>144</td><td>The White House has uploaded video of Obama's full statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>145</td><td>Iran's president Hassan Rouhani is giving his reaction to the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>146</td><td>Follow Saeed Kamali Dehghan for translations of the highlights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>147</td><td>Obama warns Congress that he will veto any attempts to block the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>148</td><td>Obama said the deal was testament to the success of US sanctions against Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>149</td><td>Obama says the deal is in the tradition of US leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>150</td><td>"A comprehensive, long-term deal with Iran that will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>151</td><td>"This deal demonstrates that American diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>152</td><td>"Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>153</td><td>"This deal meets every single one of the bottom lines...we established when we achieved a framework earlier this spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>154</td><td>"Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off."</td></tr>
<tr><td>155</td><td>Meanwhile, Obama is giving a statement in the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>Today is an historic day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>157</td><td>It is a great honour for us to announce that we have reached an agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>158</td><td>With courage, political will, mutual respect and leadership, we delivered on what the world was hoping for: a shared commitment to peace and to join hands in order to make our world safer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>159</td><td>This is an historic day also because we are creating the conditions for building trust and opening a new chapter in our relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>160</td><td>This achievement is the result of a collective effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>161</td><td>No one ever thought it would be easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>162</td><td>Historic decisions never are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>163</td><td>But despite all twists and turns of the talks, and the number of extensions, hope and determination enabled us to overcome all the difficult moments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>164</td><td>We have always been aware we had a responsibility to our generation and the future ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>165</td><td>Thanks to the constructive engagement of all parties, and the dedication and ability of our teams, we have successfully concluded negotiations and resolved a dispute that lasted more than 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>166</td><td>Many people brought these difficult negotiations forward during the last decade and we would like to thank all of them - as we would like to thank the International Atomic Energy Agency for its critical contribution and close cooperation as well as the Austrian government for the support and hospitality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>167</td><td>We, the EU High Representative for Foreign and Security policy and the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran, together with the Foreign Ministers of the People s Republic of China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States of America met here in Vienna, following several months of intensive work, at various levels and in different formats, to negotiate the text of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), based on the key parameters agreed in Lausanne on 2 April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>168</td><td>The E3/EU+3 and the Islamic Republic of Iran welcome this historic Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which will ensure that Iran's nuclear programme will be exclusively peaceful, and mark a fundamental shift in their approach to this issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>169</td><td>They anticipate that full implementation of this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>170</td><td>Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>171</td><td>The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action includes Iran's own long-term plan with agreed limitations on Iran's nuclear program, and will produce the comprehensive lifting of all UN Security Council sanctions as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme, including steps on access in areas of trade, technology, finance, and energy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>172</td><td>The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action comprises of a main text, and five technical annexes - on nuclear, sanctions, civil nuclear energy cooperation, a joint commission, and implementation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>173</td><td>These documents are detailed and specific: that is important because all sides wanted clarity so as to ensure the full and effective implementation of the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>174</td><td>The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is a balanced deal that respects the interests of all sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>175</td><td>It is also complex, detailed and technical: we cannot fully summarise the agreement now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>176</td><td>But the full main text and all its annexes will be made public still today and will be presented within the next few days by the E3+3 to the Security Council for endorsement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>177</td><td>We know that this agreement will be subject to intense scrutiny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>178</td><td>But what we are announcing today is not only a deal but a good deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>179</td><td>And a good deal for all sides - and the wider international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>180</td><td>This agreement opens new possibilities and a way forward to end a crisis that has lasted for more than 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>181</td><td>We are committed to make sure this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is fully implemented, counting also on the contribution of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>182</td><td>We call on the world community to support the implementation of this historic effort.</td></tr>

<tr><td>241</td><td>France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, says the nuclear deal will be sufficiently solid for at least 10 years and that major powers would watch carefully how Iran uses money from the lifting of sanctions, Reuters reports.</td></tr>

<tr><td>245</td><td>Fabius also said he did not think French firms would be penalised by Iran despite Paris' perceived tough stance in the nuclear talks, adding that he may travel to Tehran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>246</td><td>The key detail to watch out for in the deal is the inspection arrangements for suspect sites, according to Dennis Ross, a former adviser on Iran to both presidents Bush and Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>247</td><td>The US has been trying to secure "no notice" inspections of nuclear sites in the face of resistance from Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>248</td><td>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ross outlined a number of questions he was seeking answers to in the small print of the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>249</td><td>He asked: "How much control do the Iranians have over that [inspections]? Are they able to affect the timing of that. When the Iranians talk about managed access [to those sites] does that mean that basically they are in a position to have time [discrepancy] to resist access to the site? The more we know about those questions the more comfortable I will be."</td></tr>
<tr><td>250</td><td>Former UN weapons inspectors Scott Ritter, who had warned that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction in the runup to the Iraq war, says Iran has been right to resist "no notice" inspections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>251</td><td>"Iran has been put in the impossible position of having to prove a negative. If it accepts inspections based on allegations it knows to be baseless, then it's opening itself up to an endless cycle of foreign intrusion into its military and security infrastructure, and the inability of inspectors to discover something of relevance will only reinforce the belief that something is being hidden. We saw this happen before in Iraq, and the end result was a war based on flawed intelligence and baseless accusations that left many thousands dead and a region in turmoil."</td></tr>
<tr><td>252</td><td>Saeed Kamali Dehghan has been gauging reaction from Iranian business leaders to the prospects of sanctions relief and an end to Iran's international isolation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>253</td><td>"In the near term, the economic uplift from the nuclear deal will be domestic. At a very basic level, the prospect of sanctions relief, will give Iranians the confidence to start thinking more long-term about their financial futures. The key change will be less spending and more saving and investment. For individuals this means growing a nest-egg. For companies this means investing in new employees or capital assets. Taken together, more private capital in Iran will be put towards productive ends, driving economic growth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>254</td><td>"With sanctions relief, foreign investment will begin to come online in the next 6-12 months. Major multinational corporations have already begun planning new or expanded business in Iran, where consumer-focused sectors like electronics, luxury, and the hospitality and leisure will provide the best near-term opportunities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>255</td><td>"Once the deal is announced there will be a period of time before it starts to be implemented. Its unclear if Iran will see tangible sanctions relief before Congress has weighed in and the UN Security Council resolution is passed. In the interim expect both the Iranian Rial and Tehran stock exchange to rally. Consumer confidence and domestic public sentiment will soar."</td></tr>
<tr><td>256</td><td>"I wouldn't anticipated any major international financial institution or multi national conglomerate to rush into Iran because of an announcement of a nuclear deal. They will wait until that deal gets the approval of the US Congress and a resolution is passed by UN Security Council; even then they will be cautious. I would expect second and third tier firms to be first movers. They have less bureaucracy to manage and can be more nimble."</td></tr>
<tr><td>257</td><td>"In the meantime expect companies that are already doing business in Iran who have US Treasury (OFAC approval) and EU green light in the areas of humanitarian trade such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals to perhaps increase their exposure to the Iranian market. I would also expect Iran to aggressively pursue the purchase of new airplanes from the likes of Boeing and Airbus."</td></tr>
<tr><td>258</td><td>"In terms of Iran's ability to sell crude, I think that is where we will see the most immediate loosening up of restrictions. Iran has between 40 and 50 million barrels of crude at sea. Expect this crude to come to the market in short order. They will start competing fiercely to regain market share that they have lost to their Persian Gulf neighbors. Unfortunately for Iran the timing couldn't be worse. Oil prices are depressed and already their is a glut of oil on the market. Adding Iran's crude will put further downward pressure on oil prices."</td></tr>
<tr><td>259</td><td>Zarif describes the agreement as a "win-win" solution but not perfect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>260</td><td>He says the deal would open new horizons for dealing with serious problems that affect our international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>261</td><td>He added: "I believe this is a historic moment. We are reaching an agreement that is not perfect for anybody but is what we could accomplish. Today could have been the end of hope, but now we are starting a new chapter of hope."</td></tr>
<tr><td>262</td><td>Mogherini said the agreements would "open the way to a new chapter in international relations" and show that diplomacy can overcome decades of tension.</td></tr>

<tr><td>266</td><td>Iran's state media are putting a positive spin on the deal by pointing out that Iran's nuclear facilities will continue to operate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>267</td><td>It is hard to see the Iran deal as anything except a comprehensive defeat for the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, writes Peter Beaumont in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>268</td><td>He has been singing from the same song sheet for two decades warning in catastrophic terms about the threat of a nuclear Iran but - when it came to the crunch - world powers chose to go with negotiations and a deal not with the Israeli prime minister's dire warnings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>269</td><td>While Israeli officials have been at pains to say they will go ahead with their own strategy - including the usual warnings that a military option is still on the table - in reality it is hard to see that happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>270</td><td>And despite a deal that appears far tougher than many had anticipated it is pretty clear now that no deal with Iran, no matter how tough, could ever satisfy Israel and certainly not Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>271</td><td>While the Israeli government has said it will continue fighting in the US Congress it is hard to see how that strategy will help Israel in the long run at a time when it is becoming ever more diplomatically isolated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>272</td><td>The office of Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, has tweeted pictures of Iranian officials signing a proposed 'roadmap' with the IAEA chief Yukiya Amano over nuclear inspections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>273</td><td>The IAEA confirmed the agreed road map.</td></tr>

<tr><td>276</td><td>"By 15 December 2015, the director general will provide... the final assessment on the resolution of all past and present outstanding issues," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>277</td><td>It looks like Reuters has broken the embargo on some of the details of the deal, writes Julian Borger from Vienna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>278</td><td>I can confirm that the conventional arms embargo will last another five years, and restrictions on ballistic missile technology will last eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>279</td><td>Under a complicated arrangement a violation could lead to the automatic "snapback" of sanctions within 65 days, if a dispute resolution process failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>280</td><td>Reuters quotes Netanyahu saying this is a "bad deal of historic proportions", which is is exactly what you would expect him to say, writes Peter Beaumont in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>281</td><td>It is what the Israeli prime minister has been saying for months about the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>282</td><td>The reality is that Netanyahu needs to present the deal as being uniquely awful as Israel's strategy now will be to try and persuade Congress to block it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>283</td><td>Indeed, the Israeli prime minister's office has set up a task force to campaign to block the deal in Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>284</td><td>However, if Reuters' earlier reports about provisions on the continued arms embargo and a 65-day snap-back to sanctions in the event of Iranian non-compliance are correct, it would seem to go some way towards meeting the objections of some Democrats, meaning Israel will face an uphill struggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>285</td><td>Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the agreement was a "significant step forward".</td></tr>
