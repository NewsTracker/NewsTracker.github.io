<h3>Kenya: Hero's Burial for Officer Who Helped Stop Attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thousands of Kenyans Saturday flooded Cheleget village in the Rift Valley to give a hero's burial to police Corporal Benard Kipkemoi Tonui who died fighting to end the Islamic extremist attack on Garissa University College which killed 148 people on April 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tonui was part of the police department's Recce Company, a special unit trained in counter-terrorism, hostage situations and close-quarters combat, which stopped the attack on the college in eastern Kenya in less than 30 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This was after the army and regular police had tried for more than 12 hours to stop the four gunmen from Somalia's al-Shabab militant rebels from killing students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Burial for victims of the attack started Friday after the government released the bodies to their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Simon Sanga, Tonui's father told the crowd he cried and asked God "Why me?" when he received news of his son's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is not even two years since I buried another son, a police officer, also killed an al-Shabab attack in Garissa," Sanga said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sanga said in grief he thought about taking matters into his own hands to avenge his sons' deaths but after praying he removed those thoughts from his mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bomet County Governor Isaac Ruto called on the government to equip and compensate the police to help them combat the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mourners climbed trees to witness the coffin being lowered to the grave by the Recce Company in green uniforms and red berets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The 21-gun salute startled some in the trees, causing them to hurriedly climb down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The success of Recce Company has given a much needed boost to the image of the Kenya police, which many deride as ineffective and corrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The nation's police cope with poor pay and difficult working conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Transparency International has ranked the police as Kenya's most corrupt institution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kenya has suffered a series of extremist attacks since October 2011, when it sent it troops to Somalia to fight al-Shabab.</td></tr>
