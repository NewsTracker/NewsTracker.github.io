<h3>Ceasefire period begins in Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Under an agreement struck last week, Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatist rebels are to begin this week pulling back their heavy weaponry to form a wide buffer zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a live midnight broadcast, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko issued the order for the country's armed forces to hold their fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a statement before issuing that order, Poroshenko expressed concern over risks to the cease-fire posed by the unrest that raged around the strategic government-held railway hub of Debaltseve, which is besieged by separatist forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In an inauspicious omen for the prospects of any cessation of hostilities, rebels have said they will not consider any battles for the town to be a violation of the cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Shells rained down on the government-held town of Artemivsk, 40 kilometres north of Debaltseve, striking a school, which rapidly burned to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Associated Press reporters also saw an artillery barrage near the government-held town of Svitlodarsk, 20 kilometres north of Debaltseve, as well as considerable movement of Ukrainian forces' armored vehicles and rocket launchers along the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An undated satellite image released by the Ukrainian government showed a five-kilometre-long cloud of black smoke hovering above Svitlodarsk, evidence of what it said was the scale of rebel shelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Russia has repeatedly denied repeated Western claims that it has sent troops and equipment to the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, posted on Twitter what he said were satellite photos showing Russian artillery systems near the town of Lomuvatka, 20 kilometres northeast of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ahead of the cease-fire deadline, statements by separatist officials cast doubt on whether fighting would end at the appointed hour.</td></tr>
