<h3>Avalanche sweeps Everest in Nepal; 30 injured</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - A senior mountaineering guide says an avalanche swept the face of Mt. Everest after the massive earthquake, while government officials say at least 30 people have been injured on the mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ang Tshering of the Nepal Mountaineering Association says that the avalanche apparently occurred between the Khumbu Icefall, a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow, and the base camp where most climbing expeditions have their main camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While details are unclear with communications limited to the Everest region, Tshering says the avalanche did not appear to have hit the base camp itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nepal's Home Ministry, meanwhile, says 30 people have been injured on the mountain, though it was not clear where those injuries have taken place.</td></tr>
