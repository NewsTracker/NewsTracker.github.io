<h3>Convicted in granddaughter's running death, Alabama woman faces potential death penalty</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- Jurors who convicted an Alabama woman in the running death of her 9-year-old granddaughter soon must decide whether to recommend she should die for the crime or spend the rest of her life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A jury convicted 49-year-old Joyce Hardin Garrard late Friday in the February 2012 death of Savannah Hardin, siding with prosecutors who depicted Garrard as a "drill sergeant from hell," a domineering taskmaster so enraged over a lie about candy that she made the girl run until she dropped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The sentencing phase - a mini-trial within the trial - is to begin Monday, the judge said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The jury will hear additional testimony and make a decision on whether to recommend life without parole or death for Garrard, but the final decision is up to Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree under Alabama law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Garrard showed no reaction when the verdict was read after hours of deliberations, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led away by deputies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She glared toward the audience as she walked out silently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Relatives sitting behind her cried loudly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Defense attorney Dani Bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict; Garrard's husband Johnny sat behind her, hugging a crying daughter who ran from the courtroom sobbing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Authorities claimed the woman forced Savannah to run and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Savannah eventually had a seizure and died three days later in a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"That lady right there ran her granddaughter until she was on her knees begging, 'I've got to stop,'" District Attorney Jimmie Harp said in closing arguments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Speaking between sobs and tears of his own during his closing arguments, Bone suggested a guilty verdict could result in criminal charges against youth sports coaches should a player get injured during a game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If you do what they want you to do ... every single coach out there is going to quit within 30 seconds," Bone had argued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If a kid slides into second and skins his knee, what's the charge going to be?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Garrard earlier had testified she only made the girl pick up sticks in her yard as punishment on the day of her collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Garrard testified that the girl did run, but only as practice for races at school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said she meant the child no harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Prosecutors contended that Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"She was tortured," Griffith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Defense attorney Richard Rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after Savannah while the girl's father was overseas working as a contractor for the U.S. State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some witnesses who testified about seeing Garrard force Savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than Garrard appeared to be, Griffith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said, "I think we have all had the thought: 'If it was that bad, why didn't they do something?'" He said witnesses didn't notify police about their concerns until days later, after they heard girl was on life support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Then it becomes 'Oh yeah, I witnessed boot camp. I witnessed the drill sergeant from hell,'" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The child's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, is free on bond awaiting trial on a murder charge for allegedly failing to intervene as Garrard made Savannah run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>No trial date is set for Hardin, who has pleaded not guilty.</td></tr>
