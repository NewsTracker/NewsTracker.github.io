<h3>Niger Governor Orders Evacuations Due to Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A governor in southern Niger has ordered residents of islands on Lake Chad to evacuate to the mainland by Monday because of the threat posed by Boko Haram militants from Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A Boko Haram attack on Karamga island in Lake Chad last weekend left 156 militants, 46 Niger soldiers and 28 civilians dead, according to Niger's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A February attack on the same island killed seven soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Niger security and defense forces say the militants have been cleared from the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, a government official told The Associated Press on Friday that they want island residents to evacuate so the military can launch an offensive to flush the Islamic militants from hiding spots there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak to the press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gov. Yacoubou Soumana Gaoh of the southern Diffa region said on Thursday the military would help fisherman, herders and farmers from several islands move to the mainland under protection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lake Chad sits in central Africa between Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Niger joined a regional offensive in January that has retaken large swaths of territory from the Nigeria-based Boko Haram, whose fighters had months of gains in Nigeria and pushed across borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The militant group's nearly 6-year uprising in northeastern Nigeria aims to establish an Islamic "caliphate" and has killed thousands - a reported 10,000 just last year - and driven 1.5 million people from their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At least 2,000 women and girls have been abducted by Boko Haram since 2014, forced to become sex slaves and fighters, Amnesty International says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Unknown hundreds of boys and young men also have been kidnapped and forced to fight for Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Those who refuse are killed.</td></tr>
