<h3>US drops graphic leaflet to possible Islamic State recruits</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The leaflets, part of an information campaign to discourage people from joining the extremist group, were dropped in a canister by an F-15 fighter jet last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>""The message of this leaflet is, if you allow yourself to be recruited by Daesh, you will find yourself in a meat grinder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And it's not beneficial to your health," said Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman who released a copy of the leaflet Thursday in response to media requests. Daesh is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The gruesome drawing shows seven young men standing in a line under a sign that says Daesh Recruiting Office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A man with a monster face is beckoning the first man in line, who has a frightened look on his face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A second man is turning the grinder while appearing to push someone into the feeder tube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two legs are protruding from the feeder, and blood is spurting out the grinder's other end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The meat grinder is labeled as Daesh, and a sign in the corner says "Now serving 6001."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The scared young man appears to be dropping a ticket that says "6001."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Warren said this is the only leaflet he knows about.</td></tr>
