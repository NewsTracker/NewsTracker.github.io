<h3>Clinton trying to put emails to rest ? and prepare for 2016</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton conceded that she should have used a government email to conduct business as secretary of state, saying her decision was simply a matter of "convenience."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks to the reporters at United Nations headquarters, Tuesday, March 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Trying to get the rollout of her presidential campaign back on track, Hillary Rodham Clinton says she should have used a government email address while working as the nation's top diplomat - an admission that sought to quell a political furor some Democratic allies say she could no longer avoid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The focus on Clinton's emails has jumbled what had been expected to be a smooth glide toward the kickoff of her presidential campaign next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The former secretary of state had planned to spend March promoting her work on women's equality, a signature issue for someone who could become the nation's first female president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Instead, questions about Clinton's email habits have dominated her activities in the past week, following revelations that she used a personal email account at the State Department and did so via a private server kept at her home in suburban New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While Democrats have dismissed the notion that Clinton's emails are something voters will care about come Election Day 2016, her silence - aside from a late-night tweet sent last week - had led several of her former colleagues in the Senate to urge her to tell her side of the story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>During a news conference Tuesday at the United Nations, after she had delivered a previously scheduled speech on women's rights, Clinton pledged that all her work-related email would be made public "for everyone to see."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But she also acknowledged that she deleted messages related to personal matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She refused calls from Republicans to turn over the email server she kept at her home to an independent reviewer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The server contains personal communications from my husband and me, and I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private," Clinton told reporters who crammed into a hallway to ask questions at her first news conference in more than two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some Democrats fretted that she had yet to put the issue to rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This is something that is going to be discussed until the State Department releases the emails," said Boyd Brown, a Democratic National Committee member from South Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Then House Republicans will have a study committee to look at them, and then that will turn into an investigatory committee. Folks are going to be Clinton weary, and that's the point of this from the Republican standpoint, to make people tired of hearing about Hillary Clinton," Brown said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Not long after Clinton spoke, Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., the chairman of a House panel investigating the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, said he was "left with more questions than answers" and that he planned to call her to appear before his committee at least twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Gowdy said one appearance from Clinton would be needed to "clear up" her role in using personal email, while the second would be to answer questions related to the Benghazi attacks that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Those appearances are likely to come after Clinton returns to politics as a presidential candidate, creating an unwelcome distraction for the leading contender for her party's nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Clinton said Tuesday she had exchanged about 60,000 emails in her four years as President Barack Obama's top diplomat, about half of which were work-related.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>None contained classified information, she said, and her private email system did not suffer any security breaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But since the emails were sent to and from her personal server, there is no way to independently verify her assertion they were, as she said, "within the scope of my personal privacy and that particularly of other people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Clinton insisted she did not break any rules, but she does appear to have violated what the Obama White House has called "very specific guidance" that officials should use government email to conduct business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Republicans also needled Clinton for her explanation that she used the private email account out of "convenience" - a way to avoid carrying one device for work emails and a second for personal messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They pointed to Clinton's appearance last month in California's Silicon Valley, when an interviewer asked her if she preferred Apple's iPhone or a phone running Google's Android platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"iPhone. OK, in full disclosure, and a BlackBerry," Clinton said, adding: "I'm like two steps short of a hoarder. So I have an iPad, a mini iPad, an iPhone and a BlackBerry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Democrats defended Clinton, saying it was reasonable to want to carry just one device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Jerry Crawford, a co-chair of her 2008 campaign in Iowa, called her response "a very commonsense explanation that Americans will appreciate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"The only people I know who want to carry two devices are my kids," Crawford said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Ordinary folks get the hassle of that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Still, Crawford and other Democrats appeared girded for a lengthy confrontation with Republicans over the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Clinton, meanwhile, brushed off suggestions that the email controversy might hurt a presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters," she said.</td></tr>

<h3>Britain should arm Ukraine, says Tory donor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>No one can seriously doubt that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to continue on this path for as long as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With rebel forces now moving towards Mariupol in the south-east of the country, this ceasefire will soon prove to be nothing more than a pause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>To imagine that Russia now suddenly intends to abide by the latest terms agreed at Minsk is fanciful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Let's look at the bigger picture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Putin's aggression in Ukraine is a clear continuation of his efforts to weaken his neighbours and impose his will on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>From his intimidation of the Baltics to his entrenchment in Georgia and Armenia, his strategy of sowing instability and establishing client states on his borders has been plain to see for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Putin's Russia stands openly opposed to traditional western values of liberal democracy and self-determination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This cold war mentality extends to the fact that Russia still casts Nato - the alliance many have now written off - as the primary threat to its security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The longer the west tiptoes around Putin, the stronger he appears at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Strident nationalism has become the Kremlin's preferred means of distracting people from the hardships of an economy now sliding into chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A weak and declining Russia is, if anything, likely to be more aggressive than a strong one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>So when Putin retorts that "no one needs a conflict on the periphery of Europe", he is not speaking for himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>We cannot, and must not, believe a single word he says: about the level of Russian involvement, about Russian commitment to a ceasefire, about the fate of flight MH17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If Russia has no active role in eastern Ukraine, why did it warn the US that any military assistance to Kiev would result in "colossal damage" to relations?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Underneath the bluster is, of course, fear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Russia knows full well that US military muscle can still turn the tide of any conflict anywhere in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Opinions vary as to the best course of action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The view that we should arm Ukraine is understandably the most controversial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But it is also the one to which I subscribe as someone familiar with the modus operandi of Putin and his clique.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Power is the only language they understand; anything else is a weakness to be exploited for as long as it prevails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A united and genuine show of resolve by the US and the EU to do whatever it takes to preserve Ukraine's territorial integrity would stop the Kremlin in its tracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Opponents of this view argue that arming Ukraine would only lead to a rapid escalation of the violence within a new and frightening context of an east-west arms race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Stoking tensions, they say, will only hurt the Ukrainian economy further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They insist there is no military solution, only a political one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But we need to remember that this war is only continuing because Putin has gone unchallenged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>No one is denying there will be costs, but Putin's calculation is that the west will consider them too high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That's his gamble and we must prove him wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The decision by Britain and the US to send military personnel to advise and train Ukrainian forces is a welcome first step.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With Canada likely to follow, it goes at least some way to demonstrating that Nato is still a coherent force with the will to act in defence of international law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But we need to go further, to be bolder, and - most importantly - to galvanise the rest of Europe, whose leaders' attempts to negotiate with a man no one can trust have only given him a free rein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The US, as ever, will have to assume the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>With Barack Obama's second term ending next year he will not want to be remembered as the president who allowed Putin to have it all his own way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He should send weapons and ammunition to Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>With support from Britain, the US should expand its programme of military training and be unequivocal about its commitment to safeguarding free choice and democracy in an independent Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>We have a choice to make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>All this will no doubt stir anxieties in Europe about Nato's presence there coming to the fore in response to Russian provocation for the first time since the cold war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>American involvement so close to home will make EU members nervous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>This is where the UK has a crucial role to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>David Cameron's willingness to lead the way on sanctions has been much to his credit, but besides that he has been more or less silent while Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Francois Hollande have tried in vain to pursue a settlement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>That needs to change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Europe must be persuaded not only to stand with Britain and the US, but also to find the necessary resolve within itself to prevent any more of its "periphery" falling foul of a renewed Soviet-style repression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Ukraine has been hobbled by Russia in its aspirations to EU and Nato membership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Only the Budapest Memorandum, signed by Russia and four other nuclear powers - the US, the UK, France and China - in 1994, guarantees its borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>But this struggle goes far beyond the sovereignty of Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>It is about the readiness of the West to defend its principles of self-determination, democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>After years of appeasement we have a choice to make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Either we face up to our responsibility to halt this assault on liberal Europe, or we sleepwalk into a new era of Russian intrigue and encroachment by letting Putin win not just a series of battles on the ground, but a major and widespread propaganda coup as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The decision cannot wait much longer.</td></tr>
