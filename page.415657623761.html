<h3>Israeli president calls for healing after divisive election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rivlin serves a mostly ceremonial role and has positioned himself as a unifier since taking office last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One of his few actual powers is choosing the person with the best chances of putting together a coalition government after elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Throughout a close election campaign it seemed he would have a crucial role to play after the vote but a resounding victory by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party has made his considerations mostly moot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Sunday, Rivlin began meeting with all the parties in parliament to hear their recommendations before he officially tasks Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Eitan Cabel, a senior leader of the center-left's Zionist Union, which captured 24 seats to Likud's 30, told the president they had "no intention" of being part of a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Meanwhile the Joint List, a union of Arab parties, told the president they had no recommendation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We see in Benjamin Netanyahu a dangerous person, he is dangerous to democracy," Joint List leader Ayman Odeh said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rivlin also met Sunday with Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He was scheduled to talk Monday with centrist parties Yesh Atid and Kulanu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a last-ditch attempt to spur his supporters to the polls last week, Netanyahu warned that Arab citizens were voting "in droves" and endangering years of rule by his right-wing Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The comments drew accusations of racism from Israeli Arabs and a White House rebuke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Alluding to the uproar, Rivlin told Likud representatives that the emerging government will have to serve "all the citizens of Israel, Jews and Arabs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have been through a stormy and passionate election period - this is the time to begin a process of mending and healing in Israeli society," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>By winning 30 seats in the 120-member parliament, Netanyahu's Likud looks to have a relatively easy time putting together a 61-seat majority along with its nationalist and religious allies.</td></tr>
