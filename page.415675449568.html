<h3>Thoughts From Lee Kuan Yew In FORBES</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Why do your human rights and civil liberties groups believe they can beat China like a Third World, aid-receiving country and chastise her and admonish her as if she were a colony or semicolony in Africa or in the South Pacific? This is absurd. This is a very old civilization, a very proud people who have gone through 200 years of humiliation and want to recover their strength and their self-respect. I would not go around baiting them and provoking them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"In November 1978 Deng made his first and only visit to Singapore. What he saw on that visit changed the course of economic policy in the coastal provinces of China. At dinner he congratulated me on Singapore's accomplishments. I told him that with its wealth of talent China could surpass Singapore. During his visit Deng warned us of the Russian bear using Vietnam as its cat's paw to control Southeast Asia. I told him that the Soviet Union was far away but reminded him that all the exhortations for the overthrow of local governments in Southeast Asia were coming from broadcasting stations in China and that the arms finding their way to the insurgents were being provided by China. I expected an angry and vehement denial, but he unexpectedly asked, "What do you want me to do?" I replied, "Stop it!" He responded, "Give me time." A year later the broadcasts stopped. Deng may have been short of stature, but he was a giant of a leader."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>SINGAPORE - MARCH 23: People pay tribute at Tanjong Pagar Community Club following the passing of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on March 23, 2015 in Singapore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Former Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, 91, died last night at Singapore General Hospital after spending several weeks in critical condition after being admitted for pnemonia on February 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Lee Kuan Yew served as the first Prime Minister of Singapore when it gained rule from Britain in 1959 and until he stepped down in 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The inevitable surprises will occur, but both China and India are on course for a revival of their glorious civilizations. By 2050 the world's economic center of gravity will move from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Indian oceans."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The Chinese must prove to themselves that they are capable of building a modern nation. For this, China needs a large, well-educated middle class; if and when it gets it, many of them will have been educated in the West and will be familiar with the U.S. and Europe. Then, like the educated of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, they will cease to view themselves as victims of Western imperialism."</td></tr>
