<h3>Key figures in fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A look at some of the key figures in the case of Michael Brown, the black 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His death stirred weeks of violent unrest in the St. Louis suburb after the shooting and again in November, after a grand jury decided not to indict the officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Michael Brown graduated from Normandy High School last spring and was preparing to attend Vatterott College, where he planned to study to become a heating and air conditioning technician.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Friends say he eventually wanted to go into business for himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Relatives and friends described Brown, who grew up in a tough neighborhood, as a quiet, gentle giant who stood around 6-foot-3 and weighed nearly 300 pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He was unarmed on the day he was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police said later that he was a suspect in the "strong-arm" robbery of a convenience store moments before the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A family attorney said Brown may have made mistakes but did not deserve to die.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some descriptions of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson are similar to those of Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both men have been described as gentle and quiet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had no previous complaints against him and a good career record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He's devastated," the chief said after naming Wilson as the shooter back in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"He never intended for this to happen. He is, and has been, an excellent police officer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wilson began his career in nearby Jennings before moving to the Ferguson job several years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting and resigned in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Thomas Jackson was a police veteran long before he came to Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He spent more than 30 years with the St. Louis County Police Department, at one point serving as commander of a drug task force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Before that, he was a SWAT team supervisor, undercover detective and hostage negotiator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He heads a department with 53 officers, only three of them black, in a town where nearly 70 percent of the 21,000 residents are African-American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I'm constantly trying to recruit African-Americans and other minorities," Jackson has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"But it's an uphill battle. The minority makeup of this police department is not where I want it to be."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some of Jackson's actions in the wake of the shooting have drawn criticism, including his decision to announce that Brown was a suspect in the convenience store robbery, a move that stirred anger in Ferguson's black community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Since his election in 1991, Bob McCulloch has been the top prosecutor in St. Louis County.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A Democrat with a reputation for being tough on crime, he comes from a law-enforcement family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He was 12 when his father, a police officer, was shot and killed by a black suspect in 1964.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some critics, including St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, questioned McCulloch's ability to be objective in the Ferguson case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They wondered if the loss of his father in such circumstances creates a built-in bias.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>During a 27-year career, Capt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Ron Johnson rose from patrolman to chief of the 11-county division of the Missouri State Highway Patrol that includes St. Louis and its suburbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Back in August, Gov. Jay Nixon appointed Johnson to take command of security in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>That decision came after complaints that authorities were too heavy-handed with protesters when St. Louis County police were in charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Johnson's calm but commanding presence drew high praise from many observers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>When Johnson, who is black, walked down the streets of Ferguson with protesters, many demonstrators shook his hand or posed for photos with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He reminded locals of his Ferguson roots and suggested that he, too, had lessons to learn from the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"We all ought to be thanking the Browns for Michael, because Michael's going to make it better for our sons, so they can be better black men," he said in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He also apologized to Brown's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat who served four terms as attorney general, drew some criticism in the days immediately after the shooting for keeping a low profile, but he soon moved to the forefront, putting state police in charge of security and then calling in the National Guard to help quell the violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Benjamin Crump became a national figure when he represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager fatally shot by a neighborhood-watch organizer in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Now he is back in the spotlight, representing Brown's family in another racially charged death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Crump was born in North Carolina, one of nine children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Now based in Tallahassee, Florida, he seems to fight back his own emotions as he talks about the loss suffered by Brown's parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"I don't want to sugarcoat it," Crump said in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Brown "was executed in broad daylight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Almost from the outset, Attorney General Eric Holder showed strong interest in Brown's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Two days after the shooting, Holder said the case deserved a full review and dispatched a Justice Department team to Ferguson to try to calm tensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The department soon launched its own civil rights investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform a third autopsy on Brown and called the Brown family to express his condolences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>He said aggressively pursuing these types of investigations is "critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve."</td></tr>
