<h3>Kenya bombs al-Shabab camps in Somalia after Garissa attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Gunmen from the al-Qaeda-aligned group killed 148 people on Thursday when they stormed the Garissa University College campus, some 200 kilometres from the Somali border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Al-Shabab has now killed more than 400 people on Kenyan soil in the past two years, including 67 people at the Westgate shopping mall in a 2013 siege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The latest violence has piled pressure on President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop the militants' gun and grenade attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jets pounded the camps in Gondodowe and Ismail, both in the Gedo region bordering Kenya, on Sunday, the Kenyan Defence Forces source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cloud cover made it difficult to establish how much damage the bombings caused or estimate the death toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We targeted the two areas because, according to information we have, those [al-Shabab] fellows are coming from there to attack Kenya," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An African Union peacekeeping force that includes Kenyan troops, and which is fighting the group in Somalia, carried out arrests and seized ammunition in an al-Shabab camp in Gondodowe last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kenya has struggled to stop the flow of al-Shabab militants and weapons across its 700-kilometre border with Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The violence has also damaged Kenya's economy by scaring away tourists and investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One of the four gunmen who attacked the university was a son of a Kenyan government official from Mandera county, which borders Somalia's Gedo region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Abdirahim Abdullahi, an ethnic Somali, was reporting missing by his father after he crossed into Somalia to join al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Kenyatta said on Saturday the planners and financiers of Islamist attacks are "deeply embedded" within Kenyan society and urged the Muslim community to do more to root out radicalisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In the capital Nairobi, where local media have become increasingly critical of what they call a bungled security response to the Garissa attack, dozens of grieving families are still trying to identify bodies at the city's mortuary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Opposition leader Raila Odinga, who was Prime Minister when Kenya sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to battle al-Shabab, said the government should start thinking about pulling out, just as the United States withdrew troops after 18 soldiers were killed in the 1993 Black Hawk Down incident in Mogadishu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The US used to have many soldiers in Somalia but it recalled them. Kenya should also remove its military officers from Somalia," Mr Odinga said on Sunday, according to comments in Monday's edition of Kenya's Standard newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Kenya has so far shown no inclination to pull out of Somalia where its troops, part of a UN-backed African Union peacekeeping mission, have wrestled swathes of territory from the Islamist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Western diplomats, however, say this loss of territory has not weakened al-Shabab's capacity to carry out one-off guerilla-style attacks in Somalia or further abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Garissa was the most deadly attack on Kenyan soil since al-Qaeda bombed the US embassy in Nairobi in 1998, killing more than 200 people and wounding thousands of others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Christian students at Kenya's Garissa University...</td></tr>
