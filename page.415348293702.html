<h3>News24.com | Missouri judge appointed to take over Ferguson court</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Missouri Supreme Court said it is assigning state appeals Judge Roy Richter to hear all of Ferguson's pending and future municipal court cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The high court said Richter also will have the authority to overhaul court policies to ensure defendants' rights are respected and to "restore the integrity of the system".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ferguson Municipal Judge Ronald J Brockmeyer resigned on Monday, saying through a spokesperson that he was stepping down to promote public confidence in the court and help Ferguson "begin its healing process."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Ferguson City Council met in closed session Monday evening, but members left without taking questions and a city spokesperson didn't disclose the purpose of the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III declined comment to The Associated Press afterward except to say that the city on Tuesday would begin seeking Brockmeyer's permanent successor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Richter will take charge of the court on 16 March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Supreme Court said it also is assigning staff from the state court administrator's office to aid Richter in reviewing Ferguson's municipal court practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Judge Richter will bring a fresh, disinterested perspective to this court's practices, and he is able and willing to implement needed reforms," Chief Justice Mary Russell said in a written statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The change comes after the Justice Department released a report last week that cited cases of racial profiling and bigotry by police and chided what it described as a profit-driven municipal court system in the predominantly black St Louis suburb where Brown, 18, was shot by a white Ferguson police officer in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The shooting prompted protests in the St Louis area and across the nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A St Louis County grand jury and the US justice department both declined to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Justice Department report said Wilson acted in self-defense when he shot Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the Justice Department said Ferguson's police and court systems functioned as a money-making enterprise that heightened tensions among residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The federal report noted that Ferguson was counting on revenues from fines and fees to generate $3.1m, or nearly one-quarter of its total $13.3m budget for the 2015 fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Although it was rare for the court to sentence people to jail as a penalty for city code violations, the justice department report said the city's court almost always imposes monetary penalties and then issues arrest warrants when people fail to pay on time or miss a court date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As a result, relatively minor violations can - and frequently do - lead to arrests and jail time, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The federal report also cited several instances in which Ferguson's municipal judge, court clerk or city prosecutor helped "fix" tickets for colleagues and friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The report cited the forgiven tickets for Ferguson officials as evidence of "a double standard grounded in racial stereotyping".</td></tr>
