<h3>Ukraine military claims 20 Russian tanks and bus-loads of fighters have crossed the border</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Ukraine military spokesman today described how equipment and ammunition had been "crossing from Russia into Ukraine" and appeared to be heading in the direction of Novoazovsk, a rebel-held town in the south-east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It comes just a week after the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany thrashed out a peace agreement in Belarus capital Minsk last Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The deal hopes to resurrect a stillborn ceasefire after the first Minsk agreement collapsed shortly after being signed five months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said in a televised briefing: "In recent days, despite the Minsk agreement, military equipment and ammunition has been tracked crossing from Russia into Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"More than 20 tanks, 10 self-propelled artillery systems and 15 trucks have entered in the direction of Novoazovsk."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Russia have yet to respond to the accusation, however Moscow has denied similar charges in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Meanwhile, Britain and the European Union were today accused of having "sleepwalked" into the Ukraine crisis in a report released this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The scathing document from the EU Committee of the House of Lords deemed that Britain and the EU had failed to grasp the nature of the crisis and lacked to ability to read political shifts in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The report also found there had been a "catastrophic misreading" of mood by European diplomats in the run-up to the stand-off between Russia and the West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There has been a strong element of 'sleepwalking' into the current crisis, with Member States being taken by surprise by events in Ukraine," the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"A loss of collective analytical capacity has weakened Member States' ability to read the political shifts in Russia and to offer an authoritative response."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The spokeswoman said in a statement said: "The blame lies squarely with the pro-Russian separatists, backed by the Russian authorities, not with an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine which had been under negotiation for more than seven years before Russia decided to illegally invade and then annex part of its neighbour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If the Ukrainian people want a closer social, economic and political relationship with the EU, that is for the people of Ukraine to decide, not Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The UK has played a leading role in supporting Ukraine's right to chart its own future by ensuring that the EU imposed tough sanctions on Russia for seeking to dictate these choices."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Criticism was also heaped on Moscow, which the report declared had been gradually shifting away from Europe and had misread Ukraine's appetite for a trade deal with the EU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Despite the second Minsk deal being signed last week, fighting has continued to rip through Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Yesterday 22 soldiers from the Ukrainian army were killed, leaving the rest of their force retreating from a battle with pro-Russian separatists in the key strategic town of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
