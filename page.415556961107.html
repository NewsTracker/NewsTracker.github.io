<h3>U.S. veteran pleads not guilty to trying to help Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Fentanyl, a prescription drug used as an anesthetic and pain reliever for terminally ill patients, is being illegally produced in underground drug labs for street narcotics, said Barbara Carreno, spokeswoman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>The U.S. Air Force veteran pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to trying to provide support for the Islamic State militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It gives dealers a more potent product, since fentanyl is so strong," Carreno said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK - A U.S. Air Force veteran pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to trying to provide support for the Islamic State militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Just like any other business, they are competitive and they want people to want to buy and distribute their product. The flip side is that this more potent drug is killing people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, of Neptune, New Jersey, entered his plea at a hearing in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Even a tiny amount of fentanyl can be lethal, since it is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine and as much as 50 times more powerful than heroin, the DEA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis told attorneys to be ready for trial in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Drug incidents and overdoses related to fentanyl are occurring at an alarming rate throughout the United States and represent a significant threat to public health and safety," DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If convicted, Pugh could face up to 35 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Because fentanyl is easily absorbed through the skin and can be accidentally inhaled as an airborne powder, it is particularly dangerous to law enforcement officers involved in buy and bust operations, the DEA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to prosecutors, Pugh, 47, a former avionics instrument system specialist in the Air Force, tried to join Islamic State in January by traveling from Egypt to Turkey and trying to cross the border into Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It takes very little for someone to overdose on it, to cause the level of respiratory depression that would cause you to die," Carreno said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Turkish authorities sent him back to Egypt, which detained him and subsequently deported him to the United States, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the last two years, there have been an increasing number of drug busts for fentanyl, with 3,344 instances reported in 2014, compared to 942 instances in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>U.S. federal agents found recent Internet searches on Pugh's laptop and other devices for "borders controlled by Islamic State" and a propaganda video by the group, according to prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fentanyl from Mexican drug trafficking organizations was seized in busts took place in the U.S. Northeast and in California, the DEA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Pugh served in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990 and converted to Islam after moving to San Antonio, Texas, in 1998, becoming "increasingly radical in his beliefs" in following years, according to a criminal complaint filed when he was arrested in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Recently, fentanyl overdoses have accounted for four deaths in New Hampshire over two months, 80 deaths in six months in New Jersey, and 200 deaths in 15 months in Pennsylvania.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While Pugh was working as a mechanic for American Airlines, a co-worker told the FBI that Pugh "sympathized with Osama bin Laden, felt that the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies were justified and expressed anti-American sentiment," the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It's a scourge last seen in the United States between 2005 and 2007, when more than 1,000 deaths in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and other cities were attributed to fentanyl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 2002, an associate of Pugh also told the FBI that Pugh had expressed interest in going to Chechnya to fight, the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The source of that fentanyl was traced to a single lab in Mexico. When that lab was identified and dismantled, the surge ended," the DEA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nonetheless, Pugh worked on aircraft avionics as an Army contractor for DynCorp International in Iraq from October 2009 to March 2010, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It said the current outbreak affects a wider geographic area and an array of new and experienced drug abusers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In the weeks before traveling to Egypt, he had been fired from a job as an airplane mechanic in the Middle East and had been living abroad for a year, according to prosecutors.</td></tr>
