<h3>Judge: Man charged in Facebook fraud case apparently fled</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Paul Ceglia dropped out of touch with his pretrial services officer and did not respond to attempts to reach him, Assistant U.S. Attorney Janis Echenberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. District Judge Vernon S. Broderick in Manhattan revoked Ceglia's $250,000 bail two days after it was discovered that the businessman was no longer at his Wellsville home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ceglia's lawyers said he failed to respond to messages sent by phone and email instructing him to appear at Tuesday's hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The judge noted how difficult it is to tamper with a monitoring bracelet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He also questioned whether Ceglia had been planning to run for months, since the defendant had successfully requested in September that his bail be modified so that he could access some of real estate equity to hire lawyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Broderick said he now wondered whether Ceglia may be using some of the money "in connection with his flight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The judge added that freeing himself of the electronic bracelet and making a run for it "probably took a fair amount of planning."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Defense attorney Robert Fogg told Broderick that he believed that properties supporting the bail could not be sold because of the economic climate and because of the criminal charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prosecutors say Ceglia doctored a contract he signed with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in 2003 to make it seem he was part owner of the Menlo Park, California, company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ceglia had pleaded not guilty to fraud charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 2010, Ceglia filed a multibillion-dollar lawsuit claiming that the 2003 software development contract included a provision entitling Ceglia to half ownership of Facebook in exchange for startup money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A federal judge in Buffalo threw out the lawsuit after a magistrate judge concluded that the contract was altered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Facebook lawyers have said the two had a contract but that references to Facebook were added for purposes of the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ceglia was criminally charged in 2012.</td></tr>

<h3>Padres' Federowicz to undergo surgery</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tim Federowicz will undergo surgery Thursday to repair a lateral meniscus tear in his right knee, manager Bud Black said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Black did not have a timetable for the catcher's return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Federowicz experienced right knee discomfort while catching in Sunday's game against the Rockies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He arrived in the clubhouse Monday on crutches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An MRI later revealed the tear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 27-year-old may have had an advantage in the competition for the Padres' backup catching job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Acquired from the Dodgers in December, he is out of minor league options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Federowicz and starter Derek Norris are the only catchers on the 40-man roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The other five catchers in major league camp -- Wil Nieves, Austin Hedges, Griff Erickson, Rocky Gale and Cody Decker -- are non-roster invitees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Only Nieves, 37, has big-league experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He has appeared in the majors with seven organizations over parts of 11 seasons, with a .243 career average and nine home runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hedges is arguably the best defensive catching prospect in the minors, but struggled on offense last season as he caught 106 games in the Texas League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Just 22, he could use regular at-bats when the season opens -- for Hedges, likely in Triple-A El Paso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Erickson, who will turn 27 on Wednesday, signed as a minor league free agent after eight seasons in the Dodgers' organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Westview High graduate will have to refine his receiving skills to crack the majors for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Gale, 27, caught 71 games for Triple-A El Paso last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Decker, 28, led that affiliate with 27 home runs but primarily has played first base throughout his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We'll continue to rotate those guys, but somebody's going to have to pick up the innings we had planned for Tim," Black said.</td></tr>
