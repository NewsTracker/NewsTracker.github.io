<h3>Google Incâ€™s Waze mapping company to launch carpooling pilot program in Israel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM - Google-owned online mapping company Waze is launching a carpooling pilot program in Israel where commuters pay fellow drivers a small fee for a ride to and from work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new application, called RideWith, will use Waze's navigation system to learn the routes drivers most frequently take to work and match them up with people looking for a ride in the same direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google bought Israel-based Waze, which uses satellite signals from members' smartphones to offer real-time traffic information, for about US$1 billion two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We're conducting a small, private beta test in the greater Tel Aviv area for a carpool concept, but we have nothing further to announce at this time," Waze told Reuters of its foray into the increasingly competitive field of ride-sharing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Drivers will be limited to just two journeys a day and will not be able to earn a salary from RideWith, a source close to the company said, differentiating it from businesses such as Uber, where drivers can turn a profit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Should RideWith be rolled out globally, this limitation could help it avoid the backlash Uber is facing in a number of countries that want to protect professional taxi drivers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Waze does not expect there to be enough drivers to meet demand at first, but as more sign on, passengers will be able to order a ride either to or from work while chipping in a bit for the cost of gas and wear and tear on the car, the source said.</td></tr>
