<h3>Police come under questioning in case of New York boy missing since 1979</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Attorneys for a former grocery store worker accused of the 1979 killing of a New York City boy pressed a police detective on Monday about his interrogation techniques, as they seek to prove the accused man's confession was coerced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pedro Hernandez, on trial for the kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz, confessed in 2012 to police that he choked the boy, stuffed him in a box and left him in a New York alley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Patz vanished as he walked alone for the first time to a school bus stop in his Manhattan neighborhood on May 25, 1979.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His disappearance sparked a national movement to find missing children, with his picture one of the first to appear on milk cartons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hernandez's attorneys say his confession was coerced and that he is mentally ill and suffers hallucinations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Testifying in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, New York Police Detective James Lamendola said he repeatedly told Hernandez: "The lies must stop" and "we need the truth" in the hour they were alone together in a room before Hernandez confessed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hernandez made his videotaped confession after about six hours of questioning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was questioned and arrested in 2012 after police got a tip that he had confessed to the crime to a church prayer group in New Jersey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein questioned the detective about his interview style, suggesting he used psychological pressure on Hernandez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"You don't get suspects to tell you the truth by yelling at them, screaming at them," the detective testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"You get suspects to tell you the truth by being nice to them, compassionate to them, keeping them calm."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lamendola testified earlier that he talked to Hernandez about a "cycle of abuse," in which victims of abuse commit abuse themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hernandez had told police he was abused by his father.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Patz has never been found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was declared dead in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hernandez, 54, told police he lured the boy into the Manhattan grocery store where he worked with the offer of a soda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>His attorneys blame another man, Jose Antonio Ramos, who for many years was a prime suspect in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ramos is a convicted child molester in prison in Pennsylvania.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They say Ramos' neighbors identified Patz as a boy seen in a Manhattan apartment building where Ramos lived at the time of the boy's disappearance.</td></tr>
