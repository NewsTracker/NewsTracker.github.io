<h3>Jailed Islamic State militant still longs for martyrdom</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 30-year old Islamic State militant hid in the bushes on the banks of the river Tigris for two days before venturing out in search of a boat, but by that time Kurdish forces had overrun the area and he was taken prisoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ERBIL, Iraq: The airstrike obliterated its target in northern Iraq and sent the men scattering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Four of them dived into a river and crossed to safety on the other side, but the fifth froze at the water's edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He had never learned to swim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I wish I had been martyred," Mohanad told Reuters in an interview at the maximum security jail where he has been held since January in the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The interview, arranged by Kurdish authorities at Reuters request, took place in an office at the jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A jail official was present most of the time but occasionally left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mohanad appeared healthy and comfortable speaking about his past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He wore a white polo shirt with blue stripes, instead of a prison uniform, and a few days' stubble rather than the full beard typical of jihadist fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His wrists were bound by handcuffs, while his feet, in plastic sandals, were loose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was given water and tea in paper cups, but drank neither.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mohanad is far from the image of ruthless efficiency projected by the militant group in videos that show its fighters beheading captives and gunning down prisoners in mass graves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His experience gives a sense of what it is like to serve at the lower rungs of the organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For Mohanad, it was at least partly about fulfilling the legacy of his two elder brothers who joined Islamic State's predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, following the US-led invasion in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Both were killed fighting American forces in Mosul, the largest city in Iraq's north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He says he believes his fellow Sunni Muslims were ill-treated under the Shi'ite dominated order that took power in Iraq after the US invasion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Last June, the day Islamic State fighters swept in from Syria and captured Mosul, Mohanad was at home not far away in the village of Danich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He watched on TV overjoyed as the Sunni militants stormed the city before tearing towards Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Young men from the area began to enlist in the group, and Mohanad resolved to do so as well: "I thought: two of my brothers joined this organisation and I am the only one left".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mohanad's father had died in a car accident years earlier, but he sought his mother's blessing before leaving: "She said go," he said, laughing as he recalled her words: "I have already lost two sons: go with them too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>At a local Islamic State headquarters in the Shora district near Mosul, Mohanad was sworn into the group by a man known as Abu Saleh: "I held his hand and said: 'I pledge allegiance', and I joined the organisation," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The new recruit was given a Kalashnikov and taught to fire it, he said, miming the action of loading a rifle as far as the handcuffs around his wrists would allow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>For the next five months, Mohanad guarded an Islamic State office in a village southwest of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It was uneventful, he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The 300,000 Iraqi dinars ($260) Mohanad earned per month on the Islamic State payroll was more than he had made as a manual labourer since dropping out of school in the first year of secondary education, having repeatedly failed his exams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As the militant group lost ground in northern Iraq towards the end of 2014, Mohanad was put in charge of a small unit of four men at an outpost along the frontline southeast of Mosul, where Islamic State was confronting Kurdish security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The five of them, all Iraqi, took turns keeping watch over the enemy through a pair of binoculars in two hour shifts during the day, while another larger group replaced them at night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Off duty fighters sat in a small encampment, drinking tea to keep warm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They were regularly brought bread, jam and eggs by someone from a village across the river in a skiff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Instructions came from "Abu Saad", a local Islamic State leader with whom the men communicated via walkie-talkie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mohanad said he did not meet any foreign fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The men shared a machine gun, although Mohanad said they did not engage in combat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Every five days, Mohanad was allowed to return home to his wife and three children - aged 6, 5 and 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>They are not aware of his fate and must assume him dead, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Mohanad said he misses his family, but otherwise showed little remorse, except for having been captured and thereby denied a place in paradise with the 72 virgins promised to martyrs in Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"They are very beautiful," he said, grinning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Asked why he had not volunteered for a suicide mission if his desire was martyrdom, he said the prospect was daunting and he did not know how to drive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The mention of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi still inspires reverence in Mohanad, though he has only ever seen him on TV: "He is on the path of the righteous, God willing".</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"The most important thing is for Islam to spread," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"It (Islamic State) will continue to fight until it advances."</td></tr>
