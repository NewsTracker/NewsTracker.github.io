<h3>Apple reportedly on new quest to start online TV service</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>With online television gaining momentum this year, Apple TV has reportedly renewed talks with network officials about starting its own web TV offering this fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple has talked to network programmers about a service that would offer about 25 channels, with programming from big networks like ABC, CBS and Fox, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The paper, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, said Apple wants to charge $30 to $40 per month for a service that would work on Apple devices, but isn't talking to Comcast's NBCUniversal because of a falling-out between the two companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Cupertino company has talked to the networks before about a TV streaming service and the tech news site re/code reported last month that Apple had resumed talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>So far, Apple's only venture into TV is Apple TV, a box that connects to TV monitors and streams Internet video content from other companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last week, Apple dropped the price of the Apple TV from $99 to $69.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Apple also announced HBO's own streaming service, HBO Now, will debut exclusively on Apple TV next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Paul Erickson, senior analyst for IHS Technology, wrote in a research note that the Apple TV price drop is a reaction to the competition, but also "gives credence to a likely launch of the next-generation Apple TV later in 2015."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Overall, to create and sustain market advantage against rapidly strengthening competition, Apple will need to expand the overall capabilities of Apple TV, continue expanding the selection of marquee content partners, release updated hardware, or some combination thereof," Erickson wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple declined to comment on the latest reports.</td></tr>
