<h3>The Latest: Spanish finance chief urges caution on Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras attends a meeting with lawmakers of Syriza party at the Greek Parliament in Athens, Friday, July 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tsipras will seek backing for a harsh new austerity package from his party Friday to keep his country in the euro - less than a week after urging Greeks to reject milder cuts in a referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Spanish Economy Minister Luis De Guindos is advising caution, not optimism, about Greece's reform proposals, which he says he hasn't seen yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The proposals are to be discussed by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday, ahead of an EU summit Sunday, following months of failed negotiations between Athens and creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>De Guindos said "I would be cautious" about the chances of the proposals bringing a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Even so, he said the proposals moved Greece "back to a square before the referendum."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A group of dissenters in Greece's governing Syriza party is urging the government to prepare to leave the euro and to reject any deal with creditors that involves more crippling austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The group known as the Left Platform submitted a letter to Syriza lawmakers who met in parliament early Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In it, the group said an exit from the euro "under present conditions is a difficult but feasible process that will allow the country to follow a different path."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Syriza lawmakers met ahead of vote to authorize Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to negotiate a deal with creditors in Brussels this weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His government submitted a list of reforms to creditors late Thursday in order to win support for a new financial rescue of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>So far, most of the responses to the proposals have been positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The president of Cyprus says the Greek government's reform proposals to its creditors are much improved from previous versions and that there's a "solid basis" for an agreement to prevent the country from going bankrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>President Nicos Anastasiades says he's "more optimistic" now than he was in the past few days when there was much uncertainty whether Greece would meet a Thursday deadline to submit the proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Anastasiades said he fully supports the restructuring of Greece's debt to make it more sustainable which would help the country overcome its economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said debt relief doesn't necessarily mean a write-off, but an agreement could see repayment deadlines extended and interest rates slashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Anastasiades was speaking after talks aimed at reunifying ethnically divided Cyprus with breakaway Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The International Monetary Fund's outgoing chief economist thinks Greece may need more money than the fund thought even last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In a blog post, Olivier Blanchard said Greece will likely need more than the 60 billion euros or so that the Fund indicated in a report last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said a big portion of the additional help is needed to help Greece's banks which are exposed to shaky Greek government bonds and have been fighting an outflow of deposits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Blanchard also said Greece may need more generous debt relief than anticipated and that Greece's European creditors considered the analysis "as too pessimistic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Greece has sent creditors a list of reform proposals in order to get 53.5 billion euros ($59.5 billion) of financing for three years and is hopeful of getting some sort of debt relief in return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has expressed cautious optimism that Greece's latest offer could resolve a debt standoff and allow the country to stay in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He told a forum in New York on Friday that "It certainly looks like they're getting closer," adding, however, that "they've had trouble getting from close to closed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He says Greece needs to take difficult steps to reduce budget deficits and make its economy more efficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He also says Greece's creditors need to restructure the country's debt, though that would not necessarily mean they would have to write off a part of what Greece owes them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He says "It's going to be a long slog through the next few days, but it should get worked out."</td></tr>
