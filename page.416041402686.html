<h3>Bust of Edward Snowden sneaked into, removed from NYC park</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A 4-foot-high, 100-pound sculpted bust of the whistleblower now exiled in Russia was sneaked into Brooklyn's Fort Greene Park on Monday before dawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Animal New York, a city news website that first reported the incident, said the mysterious perpetrators were a small group of artists - admirers of the former contractor who had leaked classified information from the National Security Agency to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The activists hoisted the bust to the top of a Revolutionary War memorial, adding his name to a column, according to Animal New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The website says the group allowed it to document installation of the statue on the condition that it not reveal the identities of the artists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Snowden's artistic appearance was short-lived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At daybreak, police said city parks officials ordered the sculpted Snowden removed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And by evening, his bust was being held at Brooklyn's 88th Precinct pending an investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The idea for the tribute was conceived by two New York City-based artists, joined by a West Coast sculptor, Animal New York said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a statement to the online outlet, they said they had "updated" the memorial to American POWs who died during the Revolutionary War "to highlight those who sacrifice their safety in the fight against modern-day tyrannies. It would be a dishonor to those memorialized here to not laud those who protect the ideals they fought for, as Edward Snowden has by bringing the NSA's 4th-Amendment-violating surveillance programs to light."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This photo provided by Aymann Ismail/ANIMALNewYork on Monday, April 6, 2015, shows an installation of a bust of the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in Brooklyn's Fort Greene Park, in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After several mysterious artists put a sculpted bust of Snowden on a New York City war memorial, parks officials have ordered the bust removed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Animal New York, a city news website, reported that the activists sneaked the 4-foot-tall, 100-pound bust of Snowden before dawn Monday.</td></tr>
