<tr><td>3</td><td>The preparations at the execution site have been completed at Nusakambangan Island's maximum-security prison facilities, said Attorney General Muhammad Prasetyo.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Prasetyo, speaking in the capital, Jakarta, did not give a date for the executions.</td></tr>
