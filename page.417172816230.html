<tr><td>6</td><td>The officers, three white men and three African Americans including a woman, will formally hear the charges and enter pleas at a July 2 arraignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mosby, a 35-year-old African American who took office in January, surprised many Baltimoreans early this month by announcing her swift decision to seek the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Under the U.S. judicial system, grand juries are empowered to hear a prosecutor's evidence and return charges against a defendant if the panel agrees there is probable cause to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"These past two weeks, my team has been presenting evidence to a grand jury that just today returned indictments against all six officers," Mosby told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She took no questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Gray, 25, died on April 19, a week after he was arrested and driven in a police van to a station house for booking.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Mosby said officers repeatedly ignored Gray's pleas for medical attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His death set off weeks of largely peaceful protests in Baltimore punctuated by a day of unrest after his funeral on April 27, when rioters threw rocks at police and set buildings and cars on fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It followed a string of police-involved killings of unarmed black men, notably in Ferguson, Missouri, New York City and North Charleston, South Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The cases have fueled waves of protests across the United States over what civil rights activists say is law enforcement's unjustified use of lethal force against minority groups.</td></tr>
