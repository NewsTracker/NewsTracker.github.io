<h3>Penn State seeks frat members who posted nude photos online</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A now-suspended Pennsylvania State University fraternity's Facebook posting of photos of nude and partly nude women, some of them asleep or passed out, is sad and offensive and could lead to some students being expelled, the university's president said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I can't imagine anybody that's not appalled by the alleged behavior," Eric Barron said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The national leaders of Kappa Delta Rho on Tuesday suspended the Penn State chapter for a year over the photo scandal and said it would be reorganized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police in State College, home to Penn State's main campus, are investigating allegations the fraternity operated a private Facebook page on which members shared frat house pictures of the women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to a warrant, the invitation-only page had 144 active members, including students and alumni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Barron said of the webpage: "It's very sad, and it's very offensive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police said some of the photos they had seen showed women in "sexual or embarrassing positions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While some of the women photographed appeared to be aware their pictures were being taken, others did not, police said in court documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Police have said they have identified at least two photographs that could lead to criminal charges but the investigation is continuing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A young man who answered the door on Tuesday at Kappa Delta Rho said the fraternity had no comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>No-trespassing signs were posted there on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Barron said the university is working with police to determine the number of offenders and victims and will hold those responsible accountable for what they did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This is the kind of behavior that can get someone expelled," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Penn State's flagship campus in State College has about 40,000 undergraduate students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>About 4,000 of them belong to one of the 50 fraternity chapters, including Kappa Delta Rho, governed by the Interfraternity Council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Barron, speaking to reporters at the state Capitol in Harrisburg, was asked about whether the fraternity system as a whole needs to be reviewed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said the focus should be on dealing with people who act inappropriately, not targeting the system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I think if you punish those that are responsible, we all learn, and if you punish everybody, then I don't think we really all learn," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Police were tipped off about the Facebook account on Jan. 18 by a former fraternity member who shared printouts of some of the pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The printouts were included in some of the court documents provided Tuesday to news outlets; police later said that was a mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Police said anyone who posted the photos could face misdemeanor charges of harassment or invasion of privacy, with a fine being the most likely penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They also said they expected some women would only want to have the photos removed and not press charges.</td></tr>

<h3>Results of Israel election show win for Netanyahu's Likud</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Before the vote, Netanyahu pledged to keep building Jewish settlements and shelve negotiations for a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With more than 99 percent of the vote counted on Wednesday, preliminary results showed Likud appeared set to hold 30 seats in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Despite exit polls from Tuesday's vote suggesting a tight race, the opposition Zionist Union trailed with 24 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog said he had called Netanyahu to concede the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"A few minutes ago I spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck," Herzog told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to Reuters news agency, Likud released a statement saying Netanyahu intended to quickly build a new coalition government with parties from the political right and religious groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A coalition would need 61 seats in the Knesset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Reality is not waiting for us," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The citizens of Israel expect us to quickly put together a leadership that will work for them regarding security, economy and society as we committed to do - and we will do so."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Netanyahu had late Tuesday already declared his party's victory, which came after several days of last-minute campaigning in which he took a sharp turn to the right, saying he opposed the creation of a Palestinian state and promising to expand Jewish settlement building in Israeli-occupied areas which the Palestinians want for a future state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Likud's victory is a dramatic turnaround from the last pre-election opinion polls, which put Isaac Herzog's centrist Zionist Union ahead with 25-26 seats, with Netanyahu's Likud taking 20-22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After an expected change in leadership in Israel failed, the country's current prime minister is likely the next one, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That's not good news for Israel or the Mideast, says DW's Bettina Marx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Following an initial vote count, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party look set for victory, ahead of the center-left Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A win would mean a third term in office for Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared victory after a tight election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Exit polls showed the Likud party and opposition Zionist Union were deadlocked, but Netanyahu had a clearer path to form a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As Israelis head to the polls, many are more concerned with paying the rent than the threat from Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And that could cost premier Benjamin Netanyahu the election, economist Paul Rivlin of Tel Aviv University tells DW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state if he is re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Despite last-ditch efforts ahead of Tuesday's vote, neither party looks likely to win a majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Benjamin Netahyahu is forming the new Israeli government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>His Likud party won a decisive victory despite opinions polls saying it would be a very tight contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The leader of the opposition Zionist Union, Yitzhak Herzog, has conceded defeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared victory after exit polls put his Likud party level with the opposition Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But the Union's Isaac Herzog says he's still very much in the running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looked likely to remain in the job after his Likud party clearly won the most seats in Israel's election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The international reaction has been mixed.</td></tr>
