<h3>Ukraine military, rebels accuse each other of increased attacks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's military and pro-Russian rebels accused each other on Friday of intensifying attacks in separatist eastern territories despite a two-month-old ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The conflict has reached stalemate in recent weeks with the truce, brokered in the Belarussian capital of Minsk in mid-February, still technically in force though casualties are reported almost daily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The enemy has significantly intensified firing on our positions from weapons that according to the Minsk agreement are meant to have been withdrawn," Kiev's military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said in a televised briefing, adding that the majority of attacks had taken place around the airport of rebel-held Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said in the past 24 hours rebels had fired at government troops 18 times with weapons of between 120 mm and 122 mm caliber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to the Mink deal, weapons bigger than 100 mm caliber, including large artillery, heavy mortar and powerful rocket systems, are meant to have been withdrawn from the frontline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The conflict erupted a year ago when rebels opposed to a new pro-Western leadership in Kiev and the ousting of a Moscow-backed president occupied state buildings in two big cities of Ukraine's Russian-speaking east, Donetsk and Luhansk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On the rebel side, separatist forces accused government troops in the town of Avdiivka of firing from tanks at rebel positions near Donetsk airport about 7 km (4.4 miles) away, rebel news agency DAN reported early on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ukrainian military spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said it was not possible for government troops to fire tank rounds that distance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"For that ... heavy artillery systems would be needed and we have withdrawn them," he told Reuters by phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Ukrainian military said none of its servicemen had been killed in the past 24 hours, although two were wounded by a landmine.</td></tr>
