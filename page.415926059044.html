<h3>Gunmen kill 15 soldiers, two civilians in Egypt's Sinai</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but militants who support Islamic State, the ultra-hardline group that controls parts of Iraq and Syria, have carried out similar operations in the Sinai Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Egypt is gradually recovering from years of political turmoil following the ouster of autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and foreign investors are starting to return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the biggest Arab state still faces security challenges on several fronts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sinai-based militants have killed hundreds of soldiers and police since the army toppled Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood -- Egypt's first freely-elected president -- in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That insurgency has spread to other parts of Egypt though bombing attacks in cities and towns are usually far less dramatic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has spearheaded an Arab initiative to create a joint military force to confront regional security challenges, says militants based next door in chaotic Libya also pose a threat to Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In January, Islamic State's Egypt wing, Sinai Province, claimed responsibility for a series of attacks that killed at least 30 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Then-army chief Sisi removed the Muslim Brotherhood from power in mid-2013 and mounted a fierce crackdown on the Islamist movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Security forces killed hundreds in the streets and arrested thousands, neutralising what was once Egypt's most organised political group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Sinai Province and other militant organisation who are violently opposed to the U.S.-backed government have proven resilient.</td></tr>
