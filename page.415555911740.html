<h3>Sierra Leone plans another shutdown to stop Ebola's spread</h3>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Sierra Leone is "hoping it will be the last push to end Ebola outbreak. We want it to be community-owned and for people to do the proper things," said Fatoma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There are currently about 30 cases in treatment centers across the country, Fatoma said, a far cry from the height of the epidemic when hundreds of people were falling sick each week in Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
