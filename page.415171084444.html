<h3>Five-month-old baby died of meningitis after out-of-hours doctor 'left voicemail saying he was very busy with visits - then lied that he HAD been to the house'?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Leo Radcliffe's mother had rung NHS Direct after the five-month-old boy was taken ill overnight with a high temperature and heavy breathing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A call handler from the privately run Go-To-Doc scheme passed the call to duty GP Dr Jason Tahghighi with a message saying he needed to visit the family because they had no transport to get to hospital or money for a taxi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Instead of instructing his driver to take him to their address, however, he left two voicemail messages on Leo's mother's mobile phone asking her to contact him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When she failed to answer, he assumed the family were asleep and that Leo was OK, made a 'likely diagnosis' of a viral illness and concluded that a visit was 'not necessary', the hearing was told.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But four hours later, Leo developed a tell-tale rash on his forehead, and although his parents called an ambulance he died later in hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After being challenged over what happened, Dr Tahghighi initially lied about having attended the house and claimed the lights were switched off when he arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His mother, Katie Corry, now 23, told the hearing in Manchester that in the hours before he died in June 2010, Leo had become unsettled and started making a 'whimpering noise' while out in his pram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Back at their home in Chadderton, Oldham, he refused food, and she and Leo's father Kaine Radcliffe, 25, a labourer, noticed a rise in his temperature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She gave him baby paracetamol, but he continued to struggle and was breathing heavily, although there was no sign of a rash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Shortly before midnight she rang the NHS Direct helpline, which has since been replaced by the non-emergency 111 service, and then told a health adviser from Go-To-Doc about Leo's condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Miss Corry said Leo felt 'really, really hot, like boiling hot'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'Lies': Dr Jason Tahghighi, right outside court yesterday, said that he had been to the family home and that he hadn't knocked because the lights were off, it was heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Leo's exhausted parents then fell asleep, and when Miss Corry woke up four hours later she realised she had two voicemails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'Leo was beside me and I saw a purple rash on his forehead,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Her partner called an ambulance but Leo died later that day at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His family has since received an apology from Go-To-Doc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Dr Tahghighi, 47, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, was later suspended for 12 months for misconduct by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His first voicemail message said: 'We are very busy with visits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The second said: 'As you haven't called back I'm assuming that your son Leo is doing OK and settled down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>I would suggest a follow-up with your GP some time during open hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Dr Tahghighi said that at the time he had been working an 'excessive number of shifts', including six that required him to cover if a doctor rang in sick as well as seven days at his surgery in Bramhall and five overnight shifts lasting from 11pm to 7am.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>When asked if he had been 'too busy' to see Leo, he said: 'I don't know the reason I didn't visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>I had the four visits come in at once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'I felt with no call back, I just assumed that everything was fine and settled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I should have attended but I was under a considerable amount of stress at the time.</td></tr>

<h3>Kerry working on Iran nuke deal, Netanyahu to criticize it</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kerry discussed ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, and tensions with Russia over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MONTREUX, Switzerland (AP) - As senior U.S. and Iranian officials worked in Switzerland Tuesday to reach a nuclear deal, Israel's leader warned against reaching an accommodation with Tehran, declaring to the U.S. Congress that Tehran aims for Mideast dominance and won't let any such pact thwart its plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The negotiations, being led by Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, have less than a month to go to meet a late-March deadline for a pact meant to crimp Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But even as the two sides met in a luxury hotel in the Swiss resort town of Montreaux, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was making his case against their slowly emerging agreement 4,090 miles (6,500 kilometers) away in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead of depriving Tehran of the means to make nuclear arms, the deal being negotiated "would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them," by leaving much of Iran's nuclear infrastructure intact, Netanyahu told the joint houses of Congress, in a 40-minute speech frequently interrupted by standing ovations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a sign that Netanyahu's speech was resonating outside Washington, Zarif decried comments that President Barack Obama made on Monday - as part of an administration-wide effort to push back on the Israeli's criticism - in which he said that Iran would have to suspend its nuclear activities for at least a decade as part of any final agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Zarif, in a statement quoted by Iran's official news agency IRNA, said Obama's remarks were "unacceptable and threatening," aimed at attracting U.S. public opinion while reacting to Netanyahu "and other extremist opponents of the talks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The U.S. and Iranian sides met for two hours on Tuesday morning before taking a break, according to U.S. officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The officials said earlier they expected the talks would resume and likely continue through Netanyahu's address to Congress, delivered in the late afternoon local time in Montreux.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We're working away, productively," Kerry told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are moving and we are talking to be able to make progress," Zarif said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There are issues and we want to address them. But there is a seriousness that we need to move forward. As we have said all along, we need the necessary political will to understand that the only way to move forward is to negotiate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The U.S., Iran and other world powers are racing to meet the end-of-March target to reach the outline of deal, with a July deadline for a final agreement.</td></tr>
