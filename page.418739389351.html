<h3>Jamaica stuns U.S. in Gold Cup soccer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA, GA - JULY 22: Darren Mattocks #11 of Jamaica celebrates scoring the opening goal against the United States of America with Michael Hector #3 during the 2015 CONCACAF Golf Cup Semifinal match between Jamaica and the United States at Georgia Dome on July 22, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ATLANTA -- The United States had everything on its side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>History. A raucous home crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And, supposedly, the better team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>None of it prevented Jamaica from handing the Americans their biggest upset defeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Reggae Boyz stunned the U.S. team with a pair of first-half goals, one off a blunder by goalkeeper Brad Guzan, and held on for a 2-1 victory in the CONCACAF Gold Cup semifinals Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Instead of heading on to an expected berth in Sunday's title game at Philadelphia, the Americans will play a day earlier for third place following their first home loss to a Caribbean nation since a 1969 defeat to Haiti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Obviously the team is disappointed. The fans are disappointed," U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We wanted to play in the big final Sunday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The ball gets past United States goalkeeper Brad Guzan for a Jamaica goal during the first half of a CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer semifinal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Wednesday, July 22, 2015, in Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Darren Mattocks, who plays for the Vancouver Whitecaps in Major League Soccer, put Jamaica ahead with a 31st-minute header directly off a throw-in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Houston Dynamo's Giles Barnes followed five minutes later with a goal on an 18-yard free kick after Guzan was caught outside the penalty area on a routine throw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Other than those two set plays, the Americans largely dominated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They finished with a 10-3 edge in shots on goal -- including eight in the second half, as they furiously charged at Jamaican goalkeeper Ryan Thompson, who plays for the Pittsburgh Riverhounds in the third-tier United Soccer League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Thompson was up to the task, turning aside every shot but Michael Bradley's goal in the 48th minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"My phone hasn't stopped, as you can imagine," said Barnes, savoring one of his country's greatest victories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Back in Jamaica, there's got to be a party going on. Everybody knows how we are."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jamaica, ranked 76th in the world, became the first Caribbean nation to reach a Gold Cup final and will face Mexico, a 2-1 winner over Panama in the wild second semifinal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Jamaicans want more, said their German coach, Winfried Schaefer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We have one more match to play," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Bob Marley is for after the match."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The 34th-ranked Americans, who had played in five straight Gold Cup finals and were the defending champion, will face Panama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They also must meet the Gold Cup winner in a playoff for the North and Central American and Caribbean berth in the 2017 Confederations Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Andres Guardado scored two goals on penalty kicks, including the tiebreaker in extra time, and six-time champion Mexico beat short-handed Panama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Panama's Roman Torres scored on a header early in the second half, and the 1-0 lead held until Guardado's penalty kick in stoppage time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Panama played at a disadvantage after forward Luis Tejada drew a red card and was ejected for his contact with Mexico's Francisco Rodriguez about 25 minutes into the match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Howard plans return: Goalkeeper Tim Howard is ready to make himself available for the U.S. national team again after taking a break since the 2014 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The 36-year-old Howard, who plays for Everton in the English Premier League, was allowed a sabbatical from international soccer in August last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Howard is targeting selection for the United States' friendly match against Peru on Sept.</td></tr>
