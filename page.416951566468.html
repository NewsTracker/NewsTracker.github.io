<h3>Facebook ready to test news project</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MENLO PARK, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- Facebook's long-rumored plan to directly host articles from news organizations will start on Wednesday, concluding months of delicate negotiations between the Internet giant and publishers that covet its huge audience but fear its growing power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nine media companies, including NBC News and the New York Times, have agreed to the deal, despite concerns that their participation could eventually undermine their own businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The program will begin with a few articles but is expected to expand quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Users of iPhones will see glossy cover videos and photos tagged with map coordinates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Most important for impatient smartphone users, the company says, the so-called instant articles will load up to 10 times faster than they normally would since readers stay on Facebook rather than follow a link to another site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook has gone to unusual lengths to court the publishers participating in the project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The news publishers can either sell and embed advertisements in the articles, keeping all of the revenue, or allow Facebook to sell ads, with the social network getting 30 percent of the proceeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Facebook is also permitting the news companies to collect data about readers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For publishers, the Facebook initiative represents the latest in a series of existential balancing acts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The social network, which has more than 1.4 billion active users worldwide, captures more attention of mobile users - and prompts more visits to news sites - than any other service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Publishers have little choice but to cooperate with Facebook, said Vivian Schiller, a former executive at NBC, the New York Times and Twitter who now advises media companies and brands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"That's where the audience is," Schiller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's too massive to ignore."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But Facebook's role as a powerful distributor of news makes many people in the industry uneasy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The fear is that it could become more of a destination than their own sites for the work they produce, drawing away readers and advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Five American organizations are initially participating in the instant articles project and will publish one item each on Wednesday in the new format: BuzzFeed, National Geographic, the Atlantic, NBC News and the Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Four European outlets are also joining: the Guardian, BBC News, Bild and Spiegel Online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Commenters must follow our Terms of Use.</td></tr>
