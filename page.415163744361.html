<h3>Israelis react: 'Netanyahu knows how to give a speech'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israelis react: 'Netanyahu knows how to give a speech' Some Israelis say his goal was to win over voters not American lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>JERUSALEM - Israelis interrupted their frenetic preparations for Wednesday's Purim holiday to watch Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's impassioned address to the U.S. Congress explaining the dangers of a nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Although they largely shared his view that Iran can't be trusted, many saw his speech Tuesday more as an attempt to woo Israeli voters in the elections March 17 than to persuade American lawmakers to oppose an agreement President Obama is negotiating with Iran's leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There is no doubt that Netanyahu knows how to give a speech, but his speech will not stop the Iran deal," said Isaac Herzog, head of the Zionist Union Party and Netanyahu's main rival in the elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Recent polls place Herzog's party either neck-in-neck or 1 or 2 points ahead of Netanyahu's Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The painful truth is that, behind the applause, Netanyahu remains alone. And the negotiations with Iran will continue without any Israeli involvement," Herzog said shortly after Netanyahu's talk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Isaac Herzog, co-leader of the left-of-center Zionist Union Party, speaks near Israel's border with Gaza after a speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a joint meeting of Congress in Washington on March 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Hebrew University, said, "The speech was predominantly inspired by domestic political concerns and not necessarily Israel's security. It could have been delivered three weeks ago or two weeks from now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At Falafel Adir, a small fast-food falafal restaurant in south Jerusalem, Netanyahu's speech was broadcast on two TVs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The reaction varied widely among the diners, who like most Israelis, were more than happy to share their opinions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Avi Marciano, 55, who works at the restaurant, warned that Israel "will pay the price" for Netanyahu's refusal to cancel the trip after Obama objected to it so close to the elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The message isn't the issue. Sometimes you have the right message, but if you deliver it the wrong way, it can come back to haunt you," Marciano said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ronit Vazana, 45, said she was "filled with pride" when U.S. lawmakers gave Netanyahu more than three dozen standing ovations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If our leaders don't protect us, who will?" she asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If something isn't done now, Iran will have nuclear weapons in a year or two."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Eric Gurevitz, an American Israeli, said Netanyahu "was looking out for his own political interests," but he was pleased the prime minister didn't stay home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Any deal that doesn't take away Iran's nuclear weapons potential isn't good enough for us and shouldn't be good enough for the rest of the world," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yoel Guzansky, a research fellow and expert on Iran's nuclear program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said Netanyahu's concerns are justified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Iran, whose leaders call for Israel's destruction, "is already a nuclear threshold state with the capacity and know-how to enrich enough uranium to develop a few nuclear bombs," Guzansky said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>What worries Israelis most, he said, is that Iran won't abide by any deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Iran has cheated before, and it might do it again. It can develop bombs without inspectors knowing. It might have secret facilities, and there are a lot of problems with inspections," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Larry Derfner, a left-wing political analyst, acknowledged that Netanyahu's speech was a "grand slam" for his supporters, "If the Israeli election were held tomorrow, I think it would gain Bibi (Netanyahu) a lot more votes and ensure his re-election."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"In the substance of the speech, he didn't devote a word to the all-important question: Why would Iran nuke Israel when it would mean Iran's annihilation? ... Netanyahu didn't show any evidence of this because there is none," Derfner said.</td></tr>

<h3>Clinton emails at State Department draw scrutiny</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton did not have a government email address during her four-year tenure at the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Her aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as required by the Federal Records Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was only two months ago, in response to a new State Department effort to comply with federal record-keeping practices, that Clinton's advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails and decided which ones to turn over to the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>All told, 55,000 pages of emails were given to the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton stepped down from the secretary's post in early 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Her expansive use of the private account was alarming to current and former National Archives and Records Administration officials and government watchdogs, who called it a serious breach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario - short of nuclear winter - where an agency would be justified in allowing its Cabinet-level-head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business," said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A spokesman for Clinton, Nick Merrill, defended her use of the personal email account and said she has been complying with the "letter and spirit of the rules."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Under federal law, however, letters and emails written and received by federal officials, such as the secretary of state, are considered government records and are supposed to be retained so that congressional committees, historians and members of the news media can find them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There are exceptions to the law for certain classified and sensitive materials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clinton is not the first government official - or first secretary of state - to use a personal email account on which to conduct official business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But her exclusive use of her private email, for all of her work, appears unusual, Baron said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The use of private email accounts is supposed to be limited to emergencies, experts said, such as when an agency's computer server is not working.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I can recall no instance in my time at the National Archives when a high-ranking official at an executive branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business," said Baron, who worked at the agency from 2000 to 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Regulations from the National Archives and Records Administration at the time required any emails sent or received from personal accounts be preserved as part of the agency's records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Clinton and her aides failed to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It is not clear how many emails were in Clinton's account, and the process her advisers used to determine which ones related to her work at the State Department before turning them over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's a shame it didn't take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have," said Thomas S. Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive, a group based at George Washington University that advocates government transparency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Someone in the State Department deserves credit for taking the initiative to ask for the records back. Most of the time it takes the threat of litigation and embarrassment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Blanton said high-level officials should operate as President Barack Obama does, emailing from a secure government account, with every record preserved for historical purposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Personal emails are not secure," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Senior officials should not be using them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Penalties for not complying with federal record-keeping requirements are rare, because the National Archives has few enforcement abilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Merrill, the spokesman for Clinton, declined to detail why she chose to conduct State Department business from her personal account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Merrill said that because Clinton was sending emails to other State Department officials at their government accounts she had "every expectation they would be retained."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Merrill declined to answer questions about any emails that Clinton may have sent to foreign leaders, people in the private sector, or government officials outside the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The revelation about the private email account echoes long-standing criticisms directed at both the former secretary and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, for a lack of transparency and inclination toward secrecy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>And others who, like Clinton, are eyeing a candidacy for the White House are stressing a very different approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Jeb Bush, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, released a trove of emails in December from his eight years as governor of Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It is not clear whether Clinton's private email account included encryption or other security measures, given the sensitivity of her diplomatic activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Clinton's successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, has used a government email account since taking over the role, and his correspondence is being preserved contemporaneously as part of State Department records, according to his aides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Before the current regulations went into effect, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who served from 2001 to 2005, used personal email to communicate with U.S. officials and ambassadors and foreign leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Last October, the State Department, as part of the effort to improve its record keeping, asked all previous secretaries of state dating back to Madeleine K. Albright to provide it with any records, like emails, from their time in office for preservation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"These steps include regularly archiving all of Secretary Kerry's emails to ensure that we are capturing all federal records," said a department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The existence of Clinton's personal email account was discovered as a House committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi sought correspondence between Clinton and her aides about the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Two weeks ago, Clinton provided the committee with about 300 emails - amounting to roughly 900 pages - about the Benghazi attacks that Clinton's aides had found among her personal emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Clinton and the committee declined to comment on the contents of the emails or whether they will be made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The State Department, Psaki said, "has been proactively and consistently engaged in responding to the committee's many requests in a timely manner, providing more than 40,000 pages of documents, scheduling more than 20 transcribed interviews and participating in several briefings and each of the committee's hearings."</td></tr>
