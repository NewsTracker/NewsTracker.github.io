<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) " The U.N. chief on Saturday appointed a new head of the emergency mission responding to West Africa's Ebola crisis amid hopes that the world's deadliest outbreak of the virus will soon come to an end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A statement from Ban Ki-moon's office said Peter Jan Graaff of the Netherlands will work closely with David Nabarro, the U.N.'s special Ebola envoy, in addressing an epidemic that has claimed more than 10,000 lives in the three hardest-hit countries: Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
