<h3>Iraqi offensive on Tikrit stalls, Kurds say Islamists used chlorine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Islamic State fighters traded sniper fire and mortar rounds with Iraqi troops and allied Shi'ite militia forces on Sunday in the city of Tikrit amid further reports the militants had obtained chlorine for possible use as a chemical weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A military official returned from the front in Tikrit said no major advances were made by either side nearly two weeks into an operation to win back the city IS fighters seized last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Iraqi Kurdish authorities said on Saturday they had proof the radical Islamist militants occupying large parts of the country's north and west used chlorine against Kurdish peshmerga fighters in January in a car bombing attempt west of the city of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Baghdad government has not issued a statement on the semi-autonomous Kurdish region's announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An official reached by Reuters on Sunday declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the mayor of a town on the northern edge of Tikrit told Reuters on Sunday that storage containers filled with chlorine were found by troops and mainly Shi'ite militiamen when they entered al-Alam last week, the day before they fought their way into Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We found a number of storage units containing chlorine that we think were seized by Daesh from water purification stations in different parts of Tikrit," Laith al-Jubouri said, using the Arabic acronym for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said security forces had sealed off the area where the containers were found and alerted Baghdad authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He also said the security forces had found bombs containing chlorine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Tuesday, when Iraqi forces and allied mainly-Shi'ite militias pushed Islamic State fighters out of the town, a Reuters photographer was present when Iraqi police instructed journalists to stand back and hold their breath as they detonated a roadside bomb they suspected contained chlorine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>When they detonated the bomb, a yellowish plume burst into the air, and as bystanders coughed, officials shouted "be careful, it's chlorine!", the Reuters photographer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The statement from Kurdish authorities about Islamic State's use of chlorine referred to footage of "similar attacks" during the recent fighting around Tikrit, though the mayor and another security official only noted the presence of chlorine found in areas recently seized back from IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The military campaign to retake Tikrit has been stalled since Friday, when security officials said Iraqi forces and their militia allies would wait for reinforcements before moving forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Two days later, back-up had not yet arrived, and officials continued to stress the challenges they faced in flushing out militants in street-by-street battles and defusing bombs and booby traps they laid while retreating from parts of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"There were no new pushes today from either side, only scattered skirmishes in the northern and southern parts of the city," Colonel Mohammed Abid al-Jubouri told Reuters by phone after visiting the southern edge of Tikrit on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Jubouri said the process of "organizing troops and waiting for reinforcements" was ongoing and did not say when a fresh effort to seize the central districts of the city still held by IS would begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The militants still hold about half the city, which lies about 160 km (100 miles) north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Most residents of Tikrit fled in the months after the extremists overran the city in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Fabio Forgione, Head of Mission for Doctors without Borders, said his organization was concerned about the "huge number of civilians" in areas north of Tikrit where fighting could shift after the current offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The effort to retake Saddam Hussein's home city from the militants has been the biggest offensive yet against the group that has declared an Islamic caliphate on territory it controls in Iraq and neighboring Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To the southeast near the Shi'ite city of Samarra, a suicide bomber drove a car into a group of Shi'ite militiamen, killing three of them, police and medical sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The militia groups have been using Samarra as a rear base for the Tikrit offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Atrocities committed by Islamic State continue to surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>More than 50 corpses were found on Sunday near the mainly Shi'ite Turkman town of Bashir near Kirkuk in northern Iraq, said Kamil Amin, spokesman for Iraq's Human Rights ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He said experts from the Human Rights and Health Ministries also visited three mass graves recently found near the village of Abu Ajeel, east of Tikrit, on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The experts took one corpse as sample to do analysis to determine whether they were the victims of a massacre of Iraqi soldiers of unprecedented scale at Camp Speicher in June.</td></tr>

<h3>St. Louis county officials announce arrest in shooting of police officers in Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jeffrey Williams was arrested Saturday night and is charged with two counts of assault in the first degree, three counts of armed criminal action and firing a weapon from a vehicle, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said during the afternoon press conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>McCulloch said Williams was "out there earlier that evening as part of the demonstration" and told police that he fired shots at someone he had a dispute with, and hit the officers, who he alleges were not his intended target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're not sure we completely buy that part of it," McCulloch said, adding that there might have been other people in a vehicle Williams is accused of firing from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But several activists who've been involved in the protests since the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer told The Associated Press they were not familiar with Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters - who also hadn't heard of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is a fear tactic," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, "I don't know him. I've never seen him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>McCulloch said Williams' story of a dispute with another person -- including that he did not target the police -- is still part of the investigation, which is ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>McCulloch said the .40-caliber handgun that matches the shell casings recovered at the scene of the officers' shootings was found in Williams' residence, which police searched after obtaining a warrant based on information received from the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Williams, who is being held on $300,000 cash bond, had a warrant out on him because he is on probation for receiving stolen property and has failed to appear to his parole officer for the past seven months, McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Williams is scheduled to appear in county court in Clayton Monday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he didn't know whether Williams had an attorney or when he'd appear in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A message left at the St. Louis County Justice Center was not immediately returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tips from the public were key in leading police to Williams, and McCulloch urged anyone with information to contact local law enforcement with further information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The officers -- a 41-year-old St. Louis County officer and a 32-year-old officer from Webster Groves -- were shot Thursday as protests were winding down following the resignation of Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jackson was the sixth city official to leave office following a Justice Department review of the city's law enforcement practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Both wounded officers were released from the hospital Thursday, and St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar -- who called the attack an ambush -- said they could have been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The St. Louis County officer was shot in the right shoulder, with the bullet exiting through his back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The officer from Webster Groves was shot in the right cheek, just below the eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The bullet became lodged behind his ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The shots were believed to come from a handgun across the street from the police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The gunman may have fired from up to 120 yards away, a distance longer than a football field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But with a line of roughly 20 officers standing in front of the building, the shooter did not have to be particularly accurate to hit two of them, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Belmar said Friday detectives were working around the clock to crack that case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The department's top priority, he said, was to continue "a tempo of service and protection and relationships" that ensure Ferguson does not "have a regression from all that we've done since last fall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The gunfire drew instant, broad condemnation from activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Dozens of protesters gathered again Thursday night in Ferguson, expressing sympathy for the wounded officers and praying for peace during a candlelight vigil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We cannot afford these kinds of incidents happening. That gets us absolutely nowhere," said St. Louis activist John Gaskin III.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He called the gunfire "disgraceful and cowardly" and said people "need to be working for reforms and justice, not revenge."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Robinson said the wounding of the officers "definitely set us back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But he believes protesters can regain what they lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Even last night as we protested, police were very gracious to us," he said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"That shows a lot of trust to us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Gaskin said protesters should take stock in the Ferguson house cleaning they helped achieve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement Sunday that the arrest "sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated" and praised "significant cooperation between federal authorities and the St. Louis County Police Department."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>President Obama condemned the shooting of the officers, saying that though the city's law enforcement practices were "oppressive and objectionable," there was "no excuse" for violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Obama made the remarks during a taped appearance on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Brown's family issued a statement Thursday condemning the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement," the statement read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"It cannot and will not be tolerated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and the City Council issued a joint statement saying they support "peaceful protesting" but "will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying actions."</td></tr>
