<h3>Ukraine says wants to be 'flexible' with its bondholders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Finance Minister Natalia Yaresko also called on the United States to further boost its financial assistance to help rebuild confidence in Ukraine's economy as it struggles against pro-Russia separatists in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She declined to specify a specific figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The International Monetary Fund last week signed off on a $17.5 billion, four-year loan program to help stabilize Kiev's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The program also unlocked another $7.5 billion from other donors, including $2 billion in sovereign guarantees from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Yaresko said most of those funds will come in the next 12 to 18 months, and will not be enough to grow the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ukraine's financing package also assumes Kiev will be able to gain $15.3 billion from negotiations with its sovereign bondholders, and Yaresko said she was confident that amount would come together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I think we can be flexible as to how to take our interests, these targets (of $15.3 billion), and our creditors' interests and what it involves, whether it's coupon changes, whether it's term changes, whether it's nominal changes," Yaresko said at the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kiev plans to start reaching out to individual creditors on Wednesday, and is happy to include Russia, which holds a $3 billion eurobond that comes due in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said this week that Russia is not ready to restructure Ukraine's debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I'm confident that we will find a common language with our creditors, because I'm confident that our creditors and we have the same interests, which is ensuring that Ukraine can repay and have a medium-term debt sustainability," Yaresko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I don't believe any of our creditors, including Russia, have any interests other than that," she said.</td></tr>
