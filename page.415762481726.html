<h3>$900 million investment by 2 US funds will allow Mexico to complete pipeline to import US gas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY - Mexico's state-owned petroleum company Pemex has signed an agreement giving two investment funds a 45 percent stake in a natural gas pipeline in exchange for $900 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Los Ramones pipeline will transport natural gas from Texas to Mexico and is intended to facilitate imports of cheap U.S. gas and lower Mexico's high commercial electricity rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mexico built the first part of the Los Ramones project, from the U.S. border to the northern Mexico village of Los Ramones in Nuevo Leon state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Pemex has been battered by budget cuts and low oil prices and sought help to finish the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pemex said Thursday that the second stage extending the pipeline to the central city of Guanajuato will be built with the investment from BlackRock and First Reserve.</td></tr>
