<h3>As Israelis Vote, Netanyahu Rules out Palestinian State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israelis are voting in early parliament elections following a campaign focused on economic issues such as the high cost of living, rather than fears of a nuclear Iran or the Israeli-Arab conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to fend off a strong challenge from the country's opposition leader in parliamentary elections Tuesday, emerging from an acrimonious campaign in a slightly better position to form Israel's next government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But with the sides nearly evenly divided, a victory by Netanyahu's Likud Party still was not guaranteed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His chief rival, Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union, said he would make "every effort" to form a government, and an upstart centrist party led by a former Netanyahu ally-turned-rival was set to be the kingmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The country now heads into what could be weeks of negotiations over the makeup of the next coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Both Netanyahu and Herzog will now compete for a chance to form a coalition that commands a majority in the 120-seat parliament, a daunting task in Israel's fractured political landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu appeared to have a better chance of cobbling together a government with right-wing and religious parties that he calls his "natural allies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Herzog would have to appeal to more ideologically diverse parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Either will likely need the support of Moshe Kahlon, whose new Kulanu party captured nine or 10 seats, according to polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kahlon, whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread-and-butter economic issues, refused to take sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I am loyal to my way," he told his supporters, saying he would work to form a government committed to social justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years, and recent opinion polls had given Herzog a slight lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As the results were announced on the nation's three major TV stations, celebrations erupted at Likud's campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Against all the odds we obtained a great victory for the Likud," Netanyahu told the gathering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Now we must form a strong and stable government that will ensure Israel's security and welfare," he added, in comments aimed at Kahlon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said he had already been in touch with all other nationalist parties in hopes of quickly forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Netanyahu focused his campaign on security issues, while his opponents instead pledged to address the country's high cost of living and accused the leader of being out of touch with everyday people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Herzog also promised to repair tattered ties with the U.S. and to revive peace efforts with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At a rally of his supporters, Herzog vowed to do his utmost to form a government and said he too had reached out to potential coalition partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In a nod to Kahlon, he said he was committed to forming a "real social reconciliation government" committed to lowering the country's cost of living and reducing gaps between rich and poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Netanyahu's return to power would likely spell trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with President Barack Obama, took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign, staking out a series of hard-line positions that will put him at odds with the international community.</td></tr>
