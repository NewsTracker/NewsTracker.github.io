<h3>Mourners remember Baltimore man who died in police custody</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Demonstrators march to City Hall to protest against the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in Baltimore on Saturday, April 25, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mourners gathered at a North Baltimore funeral home on Sunday to remember a 25-year-old black man who died a week ago while in police custody, an unexplained death that brought thousands to the city's streets on Saturday to protest police violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The wake for Freddie Gray on Sunday afternoon comes the day after the largest protest yet since he died on April 19 and two weeks after a foot chase with patrol officers, his eventual arrest and a ride in a police transport van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Anthony Batts, the city's police commissioner, said on Friday that officers who detained Gray failed to give him timely medical attention for a spinal injury he suffered in custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The head of the Baltimore police union said Batts's assertion was premature and "politically driven."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gray joined a long list of black men who have died under questionable circumstances during police encounters in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The highly publicized incidents have triggered an outcry over the use of force by law enforcement against African-Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Last year, weeks of protests followed the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>About 2,000 people marched on Saturday afternoon through downtown Baltimore, pausing at Camden Yards, home of the Orioles baseball team, where some protesters shouted chants at officers standing guard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As darkness fell, about 100 protesters splintered from the group and threw bottles, metal barricades and other objects at police officers and their cruisers, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The windows of several businesses were smashed, Batts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Police arrested 12 people who ignored orders to disperse, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At least one officer was hurt in the skirmishes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Fredericka Gray, Freddie's twin sister, joined Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake at a news conference on Saturday where she urged people to keep calm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Freddie's father and mother do not want violence, violence does not get justice," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Six Baltimore police officers have been suspended in the Gray case, and an internal police investigation is under way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mayor Rawlings-Blake, who has called for answers in Gray's death, said agitators at the Saturday protest disrupted the otherwise peaceful political action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I am profoundly disappointed to see the violence in our city this evening," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Much of the violence occurred near Camden Yards ballpark, where the Baltimore Orioles played the Boston Red Sox as scheduled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Toward the end of the game, fans were told to stay in place because of safety concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Protesters are calling for the prosecution of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest and a reform of policing tactics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Police have yet to explain when and how Gray was injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Melissa Ealey, Gray's cousin, told Al Jazeera that no crime perpetrated could warrant such abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"There is no reason the police had to conduct themselves in a manner to it cost him his life," Ealey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I can understand breaking the law is wrong but the way they apprehended him and the things they did where completely against protocol and just inhumane as a whole."</td></tr>
