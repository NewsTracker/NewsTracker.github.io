<h3>Bali nine's Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan could be executed this weekend after transfer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Fairfax correspondent Jewel Topsfield reports from Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cilacap: Bali nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are waiting to die on Nusakambangan island, with the Indonesian Attorney-General expected to announce they will be killed as early as this weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Australians were on Wednesday transferred to the penal island known as Indonesia's Alcatraz in a massive display of military might.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Executions delayed: Myuran Sukumaran arrives at Cilacap airport en route to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran, who will be executed with eight other drug felons, will be given 72 hours' notice of their deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Attorney-General H. M.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prasetyo is expected to hold a news conference on Friday to announce the timing of the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This could mean they would be held as early as Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Executions in Indonesia are usually held at midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Indonesian police block the street near the entrance of Kerobokan Prison before the transfer of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Asked on Wednesday if the executions would take place this week, Mr Prasetyo said "We will see", adding that he was waiting on the latest report on the killing field, the firing squad and the religious counsellors who will accompany the prisoners in their final hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He has repeatedly said the executions would be held as soon as possible once all those facing the firing squad were on Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This is because prison authorities are concerned about the unsettling effect of condemned men and women on other prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Australian government, which was not informed of the plan to transfer Chan and Sukumaran on Wednesday, warned of repercussions if the men were executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The wolf vechile carrying Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran leaves Kerobokan Prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I am sure that Indonesia understands it will have consequences," Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told Channel Nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>However, she said Canberra was unlikely to recall Australian ambassador-designate Paul Grigson from Indonesia in the wake of the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Brazil and the Netherlands withdrew their ambassadors to protest against their citizens being shot in the first round of executions held on January 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Armoured police vehicles carrying the two Australian prisoners are unloaded from a ferry on the prison island of Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also warned Australians against taking out their anger at the looming executions in Indonesia but confirmed the Australia-Indonesia relationship was going through a "very difficult period".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Abbott said he was "revolted" at the prospect of the executions and said "millions of Australians feel quite angry" and "sick in the guts" about what is happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"But I've got to say anger is not a very good basis on which to determine a nation's policy's and in the long run anger is not a very good basis on which to determine your own conduct."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Streets were blocked off in Bali and two buses of crowd-control police carrying riot shields and batons were at Kerobokan prison before dawn on Wednesday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A water cannon was also sent to the prison in case of trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In a dramatic demonstration of force, Chan and Sukumaran were flown to Cilacap, the closest town to Nusakambangan, accompanied by two Sukhoi fighter jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Andrew Chan boards the flight from Denpasar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The men were transferred to Wijaya Pura port in a Barracuda - an armoured personnel carrier - as part of a long convoy of police and military vehicles, many of which had sirens blaring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>There were chaotic scenes at the port, with armed police officers lining the streets as the Barracuda was driven onto a ferry to make the brief voyage across the narrow strait to the penal colony that has become known as death island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's families are making the agonising final journey to Cilacap, where they will be allowed to visit the Australians until just before the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran boards the flight from Bali to Cilacap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said family members would be able to visit Chan and Sukumaran until a few hours before the execution, when the pair would be placed in an isolation cell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Only a religious figure can accompany a prisoner on death row during their final hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"There will be the last moments when contact with others will be limited," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He confirmed the prisoners would each face a firing squad of 12 executioners, three of whom will have live ammunition so no one will know who fired the fatal shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"We want to show the world that Indonesia is truly trying hard to fight drugs," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said authorities were considering the last wishes of the Bali nine pair, including which religious figures would witness their deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>It is understood Chan, himself a qualified minister, would like to be accompanied by a family friend who is a pastor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Meanwhile, Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi - whom some credit as the most influential musician in the creation of heavy metal music - has appealed to metal-loving Indonesian President Joko Widodo to spare the lives of the two Australians on death row.</td></tr>
