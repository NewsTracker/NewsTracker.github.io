<h3>Hillary Clinton's campaign vows to disclose its biggest fundraisers in 2016 presidential bid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign says it will make public a list of its biggest fundraisers, a promise no other 2016 candidate has yet made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Campaigns are not required to provide a list of "bundlers" - people who ask their friends and family to write checks in support of a candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Because donors are limited to checks of $2,700 per election, these money-raisers play an important role in filling campaign coffers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the 2008 contest, Clinton, fellow Democrat Barack Obama and Republican challenger John McCain all voluntarily disclosed bundlers who raised at least $50,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Candidates are legally required to report only the registered lobbyists who are raising money for their campaigns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton says she wants to reduce the influence of money on elections.</td></tr>
