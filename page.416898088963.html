<h3>LeBron changes play, hits jumper at horn to beat Bulls (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) -- LeBron James watched his coach draw up the final play - and then drew one up of his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>''Give me the ball and get out of the way,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>James overruled Cleveland coach David Blatt's idea for a last-second inbounds play and drained a jumper from the corner at the buzzer to give the Cavaliers an 86-84 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday, evening the Eastern Conference semifinal series at 2-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>During a stoppage the Cavs only got because the officials were reviewing a play, Blatt designed a play that had James taking the ball out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The four-time NBA MVP has been in enough pressure situations that he vetoed his coach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I was supposed to take the ball out,'' James said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I told Coach there was no way I'm taking the ball out unless I could shoot it over the backboard and go in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>So I told him, 'Have somebody else take the ball out.' The play that was drawn up, I scratched it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>I just told Coach, 'Just give me the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>James, playing the final quarter on a sprained left ankle, finished with 25 points to help the Cavaliers win in another wild finish, returning the favor after Chicago took Game 3 on Derrick Rose's banked 3-pointer at the horn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This time, James got whistled for an offensive foul when he elbowed Mike Dunleavy Jr., and Rose scored on a driving layup with 9.4 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Blatt tried to call a timeout but didn't have one and assistant Tyronn Lue alertly pulled him off the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Then, following an animated break, James ended it with the 21-foot jumper over Jimmy Butler, setting off a wild celebration by Cleveland's players who pinned James to the scorer's table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Game 5 of the best-of-seven series that's had about everything is Tuesday night in Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>James rolled his left ankle in the third quarter, but fought off the injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He committed eight turnovers and struggled again from the field, hitting 10 of 30 shots after going 8 of 25 in Game 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But he also had 14 rebounds, eight assists and a shot that gave Cleveland fans some comfort after Rose broke their hearts on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''There's nothing you can do about it,'' Rose said of James' contested jumper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''He hit a great shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He's a hell of a player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Kyrie Irving, playing with a sprained right foot, was 2 of 10 and had 12 points and two assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Timofey Mozgov had 15 points and nine rebounds, and J.R. Smith, who was suspended for Games 1 and 2, came on strong for Cleveland down the stretch, scoring 11 of his 13 points in the fourth quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rose scored 31 points and Butler added 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They were the only players in double figures for Chicago, which was playing without Pau Gasol, out with a strained left hamstring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>His status for Game 5 is in question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''I thought the last two (games) could have gone either way,'' Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''They're hard fought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Cavaliers went more than 7 minutes without scoring in the third and got a major scare late in the quarter when James rolled his left ankle when stepped on Rose's foot and was called for a charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Blatt had a rough final few minutes, nearly costing the Cavs by trying to call a timeout and then having James change his play call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''Players make mistakes, coaches make mistakes and we have to be able to cover for one-another,'' James said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Rose hit two free throws with 1:32 remaining to make it 82-79, but he missed a 3 with about a minute remaining after Joakim Noah took a charge against James.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Cleveland's superstar then hit two free throws to make it a five-point game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Butler buried a 3 with 27 seconds left to cut it to 84-82.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Cavaliers called a timeout with 21.2 seconds left and burned two more timeouts trying to inbound it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>They finally got the ball to a double-teamed James, who got called for a foul after he turned and swung his elbow into Dunleavy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Rose drove for a tying layup with 9.4 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Blatt tried to call a timeout that he didn't have, but Lue restrained him, preventing a technical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>''Yeah, I almost blew it, to be honest with you,'' Blatt said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>James made sure he didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>James on his ankle: ''I wasn't coming out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>I can't afford to come out, not only because of the position that our team is in but because of who I am as a leader of this team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>I was going to fight through it no matter what.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>That's why we have a great training staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Cavaliers: The Cavaliers shot 38.7 percent and were 5 of 25 on 3-pointers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Bulls: Taj Gibson started for Gasol and finished with six points and eight rebounds.</td></tr>
