<h3>UAB president: University bringing football back in 2016 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- UAB President Ray Watts is bringing the football program back six months after deciding to cut three sports because of cost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Watts told The Associated Press that he decided on Monday morning to reverse the earlier decision after meetings with UAB supporters continued through the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said donors have pledged to make up the estimated $17.2 million deficit over the next five years if football is restored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Watts was scheduled to announce the decision to reinstate football, bowling and rifle in 2016 later Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He cut the programs last December after UAB commissioned a report saying it would cost $49 million over five years to field a competitive program, generating both a groundswell of criticism for the decision and renewed financial support for the Blazers program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''Our students, our alumni, the city of Birmingham and now many community members have stepped up with commitments to cover that $17.2 million operational deficit,'' Watts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Watts said UAB has dropped an indoor practice facility from the equation since the initial report, and has raised about 10 percent of the estimated $12.5 million- $14.5 million needed for a turf practice field and new fieldhouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Without football, UAB would have likely not have remained in Conference USA, which has a bylaw requiring members to field football programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Watts said he is sending documents to C-USA and NCAA notifying them of his decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''It didn't really come as a great surprise, but we're very pleased with the decision to bring back football,'' Bankowski told AP.</td></tr>
