<h3>Flynn scores winner, Canadiens take Senators 4-3 in Game 1 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Brian Flynn's goal was the winner at the end of a wild second period that saw five goals scored and Subban ejected for slashing as Montreal downed the Ottawa Senators 4-3 in the opening game of their NHL playoff series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Montreal takes a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference series into Game 2 on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It might not have Subban for that game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I agree it was a slashing penalty but I don't agree that it deserved five minutes,'' said Montreal coach Michel Therrien.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The game broke open when the Canadiens scored twice in a 15-second span of the second frame, the fastest two playoff goals by Montreal since 1998, with Torrey Mitchell and Tomas Plekanec scoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But only six seconds later, Lars Eller went off for slashing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Seven seconds after that, Subban took a chop at Mark Stone's hands and the Senators' scoring leader went down in pain, then rushed off for treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Subban was slapped with a five-minute major and game misconduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I think it's quite simple - it's a vicious slash on an unprotected part of the body,'' Senators coach Dave Cameron said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''You either do one of two things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The emotion-filled match featured the first goals as Canadiens by late-season pick-ups Flynn and Mitchell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Eller scored for Montreal short-handed during Subban's major.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Milan Michalek, Kyle Turris and Mika Zibanejad scored for Ottawa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Bell Centre crowd was roaring until Michalek got credit for the opening goal, which was put into the net by Montreal defenseman Andrei Markov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A rebound off the end boards got past two players and Markov tried to tuck it into Carey Price's pads when it went in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Senators scored twice through Turris and Zibanejad during Subban's major.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Then Flynn came out of a corner and slid the puck past goalie Andrew Hammond to give Montreal the lead with 2:43 left in the second period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''Losing a player, playing long stretches on the penalty kill, we didn't get any calls for the first 50 minutes or so, that's strong of us,'' said Eller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Stone, who went into the playoffs on a nine-game points streak, returned to play, left again late in the second period, then returned midway through the third frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''It's up to the league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Obviously it was a pretty big hack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It looked like he wanted to hurt me,'' Stone said of Subban's slash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It was a shaky game for Hammond, who got his team into the playoffs by going 20-1-2 down the stretch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Shots were 39-33 in Montreal's favor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Notes: A moment of silence was held before the game for Senators assistant coach Mark Reeds, who died this week of cancer at age 55.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>. Canadiens scoring leader Max Pacioretty sat out with an upper body injury but may return for Game 2 on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>. Michalek was back for the first time since he had an upper body injury March 21.</td></tr>
