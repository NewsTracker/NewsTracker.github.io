<h3>This Congressman Said Wolves Could Solve Homelessness</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Don Young of Alaska this week suggested the furry predators might be a way to solve homelessness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Young, a Republican, was carrying on during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing on Thursday and objecting to members of Congress asking for the gray wolf to be a protected species, according to an account in The Washington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"And we get 79 congressmen sending you a letter, they haven't got a damn wolf in their whole district," he said, aiming his comments at the witness, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I'd like to introduce them in your district," Young continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I'd introduce them to your district and you wouldn't have a homeless problem anymore."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>So what was the congressman actually trying to say?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The "analogy was purposely hyperbolic to stress the point that these predators pose serious threats to wildlife management and their listing has damaging impacts to local communities," a spokesman for the congressman told the Post.</td></tr>

<h3>Apple to replace AT&T on Dow Jones</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It replaces AT&T, which first joined the US stock market barometer in 1916.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Despite being one of the most successful US firms, Apple was excluded from the Dow because its high stock price would have distorted the price-weighted index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But a change in the structure of Visa shares, which is in the same sector, has made room for the iPhone maker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>From 18 March, Visa shares will be split four-for-one, which reduces the weighting of the information technology sector in the overall index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"As the largest corporation in the world and a leader in technology, Apple is the clear choice for the Dow Jones Industrial Average," said David Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple's own seven-for-one stock split last June also helped pave the way for it to join the Dow Jones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is calculated by taking the sum of the share prices of its 30 stocks and dividing the total by a number known as the Dow Divisor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The divisor is continually adjusted to accommodate structural changes to companies and to maintain continuity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As the Dow includes only 30 companies, critics argue it does not accurately reflect the broader market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The S&P index by contrast includes 500 stocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This brings the Dow into reality and the 21st Century," said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co, referring to Apple's entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It will make the Dow a more interesting index to watch, but also more volatile since it is replacing a nice, steady old name with an interesting and exciting tech and retail company."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With a market value of around $736bn, Apple is the biggest US company measured by market capitalisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since the launch of the iPhone in June 2007 its shares have risen 700%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>AT&T is worth $176.5bn and its exit from the Dow Industrials leaves Verizon as the only telecoms company on the index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>AT&T had an almost unbroken run on the Dow stock from 1916 with only a brief absence in 2004 to 2005.</td></tr>
