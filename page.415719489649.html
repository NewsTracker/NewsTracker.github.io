<h3>Ferguson City Council appoints interim city manager</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - The city of Ferguson, Missouri, has officially named an interim city manager to succeed the executive who resigned after a Justice Department report that found widespread racial bias in the police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>KSDK-TV (http://on.ksdk.com/1FUcpdY ) reports the Ferguson City Council voted Tuesday night to appoint Pam Hylton to temporarily replace John Shaw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hylton has been the assistant city manager of the St. Louis County town since April 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Shaw resigned two weeks ago following the report by the Justice Department spurred by last year's fatal shooting of unarmed, black 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The report also found bias in a municipal court system driven by profit extracted from mostly black and low-income residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Six Ferguson officials, including Shaw, have resigned or been fired since the report was released.</td></tr>
