<h3>71 Chadian soldiers killed fighting Boko Haram: army</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chad has sent about 5,000 troops to fight alongside soldiers from Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon against the Islamist radicals whose Nigeria-based insurgency has increasingly spilled over into neighbouring nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The regional fightback, concentrated in border areas south of Lake Chad and in northeast Nigeria, seems to have stopped the militants' advance for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chad army chief General Brahim Seid told reporters in his country's capital N'Djamena the "valiant soldiers" had died since February 3 in the "just and noble cause of bringing peace and security" to the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They (troops) have liberated 11 communities in Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria from the hands of Boko Haram," said Seid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Chadian forces will continue to hunt the terrorists of Boko Haram wherever they are found."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The stepped-up efforts against Boko Haram came after the Nigerian army was repeatedly criticised as ill-equipped and ineffective against the jihadists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nigeria's military -- with major backing from its neighbours -- has since claimed huge victories over Boko Haram in the northeast, retaking a series of towns and villages previously under rebel control over the last two months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's inability to get a hold on the insurgency that has killed some 13,000 people and sent 1.5 million fleeing their homes was a factor in his defeat at elections last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nigeria's president-elect Muhammadu Buhari will not take charge of the fight against Boko Haram until late May, but he has vowed to be a more effective commander-in-chief than Jonathan, in part by ensuring that the military is properly funded and equipped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The UN on Thursday launched an appeal for $174 million (164 million euros) to give "life-saving aid" to the almost 200,000 Nigerians who have fled the country due to the group's brutal attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After months of the aggressive campaign, regional military leaders believe Boko Haram's military capacity has been significantly weakened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They regularly claim to have inflicted heavy casualties on Boko Haram, though the numbers are impossible to verify independently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"That does not mean the threat has completely been averted," Niger army chief Seyni Garba said earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He noted that even if Boko Haram is weakened it has the power to carry out "massive assaults", including suicide bomb attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"There are still very small groups in certain communities," Garba said, referring to islands in Lake Chad, where the borders of Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger converge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A new attack happened Thursday when gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram Islamists killed two residents in Buratai village in northeast Nigeria.</td></tr>
