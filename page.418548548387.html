<h3>Why Germany refuses to write off Greece's debts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The International Monetary Fund says Greece's debts are too big to pay and need to be partly forgiven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Germany says that's out of the question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>German officials, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, say that as part of a new rescue package for Greece they will consider giving it more time to pay its debts and perhaps lower interest rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But no outright cut on what it owes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If pressed, Germany officials concede the IMF may be right in saying that Greece's debt pile is too big to pay, no matter how many years it gets to pay it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Still, they exclude any write-offs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The German position - joined by several other countries, including Finland and the Netherlands - seems to leave Greece in a tight spot: The debt might not be payable, but must not be reduced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Here are five reasons why Germany may be taking that stance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's taxpayers' money, and these are elected officials in a country where bailing out Greeks for previous profligacy is not popular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It particularly unloved among members of Merkel's and Schaeuble's conservative party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Countries that have been through economic crises, like Spain, are also taking a tough position on Greece since they did the hard work of reducing their own debts through painful spending cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The European Union treaty forbids countries from taking on each other's debts and, says Schaeuble, rules are rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That was a basic provision installed way back before the euro was founded, in part to ensure that the shared currency wouldn't mean Germany paying for other people's mistakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Of course, the European Union found a way to get around it to do the earlier bailouts, by citing an emergency relief clause that's also in the treaty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Give one country a break, and others may wonder why they can't have one, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain all got bailouts and imposed tough cuts along with pro-business reforms; those countries are beginning to see recoveries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Handing the left-wing Syriza government in Greece its chief demand, debt forgiveness, would encourage other anti-austerity political movements, such as Podemos in Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Spain, Portugal and Ireland all have general elections in the next nine months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Future eurozone governments may look at the debt writedown and feel less compelled to keep debt under control, an issue economists call "moral hazard."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In other words, bailouts encourage risk-taking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>German Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger says that the European approach of making countries' debt sustainable by getting budgets in shape has worked well elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said Germany still believes that approach can work in Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Why promise Greece a haircut before it does more to help itself?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Since its first bailout in 2010, Greece has been promising reforms of its wage-bargaining system, expensive pensions, shaky tax collection, clogged legal system and sweetheart deals for trades with restricted entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Somehow it all never quite gets done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Negotiations for a third Greek bailout package of about 85 billion euros will include conditions such as spending restraint, pension reform and pro-business changes that would ultimately improve Greece's ability to pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They also include a promise to ease the terms of Greece's debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The IMF's warning Tuesday that Greece needs debt relief going "far beyond what Europe has been willing to consider so far."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It isn't proposing to write off its own loans to Greece, saying it represents many poorer countries around the world.</td></tr>
