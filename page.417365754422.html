<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Voting has begun to choose FIFA's next president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Delegates from the world soccer body's 209 members were handing over secret paper ballots in alphabetical order at the FIFA congress Friday in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Afghanistan kicked off the voting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They can give the incumbent, 79-year-old Sepp Blatter, a fifth, four-year term in office or pick his 39-year-old challenger, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A second round of voting will take place immediately if neither gets two-thirds of the votes cast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan has told FIFA delegates in Zurich that "it will take a committed leader to fix this mess we are in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He spoke Friday to the congress before voting began to choose FIFA's next president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 39-year-old prince is running against incumbent Sepp Blatter, who is seeking a fifth, four-year term at the helm of the world's soccer body, which has been hit by U.S. corruption allegations this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prince Ali said "I know FIFA is not just about one man."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He promised to "fight racism and discrimination in all their forms and uphold human rights" as he turned FIFA into a more democratic, transparent and open organization.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Applause broke out after the handshake Friday between Jibril Rajoub and Ofer Eini, the respective soccer association presidents of the Palestinians and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Eini made the offer after Rajoub withdrew a motion to ask FIFA to suspend Israel from world soccer and both sides pledged to work together.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>The Palestinians say Israel restricts the movement of players in the West Bank and Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Israel has cited security concerns, especially regarding movement in and out of Gaza, which is ruled by the Islamic militant group Hamas.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>FIFA delegate Iesha Johansen of Sierra Leone has given a moving statement of thanks to FIFA, President Sepp Blatter, the English soccer delegation and others for their financial and emotional support as her nation struggled to fight the world's worst-ever outbreak of Ebola.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>"We all need to give peace a chance."</td></tr>
