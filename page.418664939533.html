<h3>Greek banks reopen as Tsipras eyes return to normal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A National Bank official opens the door of a bank branch while people wait to enter in Athens, Greece July 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>People line up outside a National Bank branch in Athens, Greece July 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>People wait to enter a National Bank branch in Athens, Greece July 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>People are given priority tickets by a National Bank branch official as they wait to enter a National Bank branch in Athens, Greece July 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A woman tries to enter a National Bank branch in Athens, Greece July 20, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>ATHENS Greeks queued outside banks on Monday as they reopened three weeks after closing to stop the system collapsing under a flood of withdrawals, the first cautious sign of a return to normal after a deal to start talks on a new package of bailout reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However capital controls will remain and payments and wire transfers abroad will still not be possible - a situation which German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday was "not a normal life" and warranted swift negotiations on a new bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The stock market will also remain closed until further notice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Queues formed outside bank branches in central Athens as people waited to take care of business frozen during the three week-long bank holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Limits on cash withdrawals have been made slightly more flexible, with a weekly limit of 420 euros in place of the daily 60 euro limit previously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Capital controls and restrictions on withdrawals will remain in place but we are entering a new stage which we all hope will be one of normality," said Louka Katseli, head of the Greek bank association.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Greeks will be able to deposit cheques but not cash, pay bills as well as have access to safety deposit boxes and withdraw money without an ATM card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bankers said there may be minor disruptions after the three-week interruption to services but they expected services to resume largely as normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I don't expect major problems, our network and the network of our competitors are ready to serve our clients," said a senior official at Piraeus Bank, one of the big four lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"There might be lines because many people will want to withdraw money from their deposit boxes," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The bank closures were the most visible sign of the crisis that took Greece to the brink of falling out of the euro earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Tsipras is eyeing a fresh start and swift talks on the bailout that will keep Greece afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The tough terms of the bailout will see tax hikes, pension cuts, strict curbs on public spending, an overhaul of collective bargaining rules and a transfer of 50 billion euros of state assets into a special privatization fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In exchange, Greece is hoping to receive loans of up to 86 billion euros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The decision to reopen banks was the first action by Greece's new cabinet after the 40-year-old leftist prime minister sacked rebels who had opposed the deal he struck with EU leaders last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Increases in value added tax agreed under the bailout terms have also taken effect with VAT on food and public transport jumping to 23 percent from 13 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Acceptance of the bailout terms that meant the banks could reopen marked a turnaround for Tsipras after months of difficult talks and a referendum that rejected a less stringent deal proposed by the lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He sacked party rebels in a government reshuffle on Friday and is seeking a swift start to talks on the bailout accord with European partners and the IMF before elections which Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis said were likely in September or October.</td></tr>
