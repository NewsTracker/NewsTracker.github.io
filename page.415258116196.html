<h3>Survivor of horrifying mine explosion in Ukraine undergoes oxygen treatment in pressure chamber as death toll rises to 33</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andrei Serebrennikov, who was exposed to dangerous levels of methane, is being treated at the Regional Hospital of Occupational Diseases in Donetsk after the incident on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The last missing miner was found dead tonight, following the blast that happened before dawn more than 3,200ft underground at the Zasyadko mine in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It is the largest city held by the separatist rebels who have been fighting Ukrainian forces since April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rebel officials said the accident was caused by methane gas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Zasyadko mine has a history of deadly accidents, including one in November 2007 that killed 101 workers, and two more the following month that killed a total of 57.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although the latest gas explosion was not directly caused by the fighting, miners say war may have contributed to the death toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Other parts of the mine had been damaged in the past by artillery strikes, which cut off access routes and may have made escape more difficult for those trapped below ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Another survivor, Ivan Lazarenko, lay in hospital yesterday - still unconscious and in bandages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If he recovers, it would be the second time this year he had escaped death at the mine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was trapped once in a lift when the mine was hit by incoming fire, his wife Tatyana Kosenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Were it not for the war between Russia-backed separatists and the Ukrainian authorities, Eduard Kiporov, one of those missing and presumed dead in the blast, would not have been working at all at Zasyadko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He took the job only because the mine where he normally worked, Oktyabrskaya, was bombed several months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'They constantly shot at this mine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They went into that mine every day and had no idea whether they would come back out or not, either from artillery fire or some accident,' said his sister Julia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The area near the Zasyadko is littered with the debris of missiles, a short distance from the graveyard where victims of previous disasters are buried and where fresh graves had been dug for those killed in Wednesday's blast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last July, a bus carrying miners to work in Krasnopartizan in Luhansk Province was struck by fire from Grad rockets killing four people and injuring 16 miners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A Ukrainian soldier has been killed and another wounded fighting pro-Russian separatists in the east, military officials said yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It came as Kiev accused rebels of increasing violations of a ceasefire deal, which President Petro Poroshenko has described as the last chance for peace with the pro-Russian rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Meanwhile haunting photographs showed 23 Ukrainian soldier's bodies being transferred back from pro-Russian rebels to Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Accusations of continued violence on both sides show the fragility of the peace accord agreed in Minsk last month, which calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the frontline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Some 6,000 people have been killed in fighting since separatists took up arms last year in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, in response to the overthrow of the Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Interior Ministry adviser Zoryan Shkiryak said the rebels were not failing to pull back, and also building up forces in southern Donetsk, near the Ukrainian-held port city of Mariupol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The military said rebels had attacked Ukrainian troop positions or civilian targets 40 times in 24 hours, including 17 artillery attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The rebels accuse Ukrainian forces almost daily of firing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The conflict has plunged ties between Russia and the West to Cold War-era lows as Kiev, along with the United States and the European Union, say they have evidence that Moscow is arming the rebels and boosting their ranks with regular army soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Russia has repeatedly denied the accusations and accused the United States of pushing Kiev's pro-Western government into conflict with its own people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Ukraine's army, which has gained experience in fighting with separatists, will also be trained by foreign advisers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'We will provide military trainers to the Ukrainian Armed Forces,' Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told journalists after his meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart in Kiev.</td></tr>
