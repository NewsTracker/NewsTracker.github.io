<h3>Nike offers partial refund to end FuelBand lawsuit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) " Nike will give partial refunds or gift cards to people who bought FuelBand fitness trackers in the last 3 1/2 years, resolving a lawsuit that says the products can't accurately tally how many steps a user is taking or how many calories they've burned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A website maintained by Gilardi & Co., a firm that administers settlements, says Nike Inc. will give $15 payments or $25 gift cards to people who bought FuelBands between Jan. 19, 2012 and June 17, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nike and collaborator Apple deny the allegations in the lawsuit but agreed to settle to avoid a continued legal tussle, according to court documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nike launched the FuelBand in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's a wrist band that tracks movement and translates it into what Nike calls "Fuel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Users can set daily goals for how much movement that they want to achieve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The band can connect wirelessly to a smartphone app and its features include a pedometer and a clock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nike hasn't disclosed sales figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last year, it laid off some employees who worked on the devices but said it would continue to make them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The lawsuit said the companies engaged in false advertising because they knew the devices could not track steps, calories or NikeFuel as accurately as they claimed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The lawsuit also alleged breaches of the terms of the devices' warranty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple Inc. and Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
