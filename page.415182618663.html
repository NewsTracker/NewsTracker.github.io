<h3>Community debuts new trailer for Yahoo that spoofs Avengers: Age of Ultron after being canceled by NBC</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Playing on the popularity of another hotly anticipated premiere - Avengers: Age of Ultron - the trailer dubbed the show 'Community: Age of Yahoo,' and announced its return, March 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After Jeff (Joel McHale) assures everyone there is 'no cause for alarm,' Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) steps in to introduce 'New Shirley,' aka Paget Brewster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yvette Nicole Brown, who played the original Shirley, had previously announced she would not be returning for the new season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>New students join the ranks of Greendale's finest, including Cougar Town's Brian Van Holt, Parks and Recreation's Jason Mantzoukas, and Keith David.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It seems that while it may be new, the season will hold onto some of the fans' favorite aspects, such as wacky costumes, dream sequences, and jokes about the community college they're always trying to save - apparently Greendale once gave a degree to a dog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Season six of Community will air on Yahoo!</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Action abounds: Ray gun fights await viewers of the sixth season, which begins March 17 on Yahoo!</td></tr>
