<h3>US-backed offensive against Islamic State in Iraq stutters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this photo from a militant website, "lion cubs" hold rifles and Islamic State flags as they exercise at a training camp in Tal Afar, near Mosul in northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Baghdad: A US-backed offensive against Islamic State faltered in its first week as several hundred militants entrenched in Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's Anbar province, withstood punishing airstrikes and held off a far-larger force of Iraqi ground troops, senior US and coalition commanders said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The slow going in what officials portray as a major test of efforts to bring Iraq's fractured security forces into a common front against IS comes as a truck bomb late on Friday killed more than 100 people, including women and children, in a mostly Shiite Muslim market town about 55 kilometres north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The explosion in Khan Bani Saad, one of the deadliest since US combat troops withdrew from Iraq in December 2011, caught shoppers out for the Eid al-Fitr celebration that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>IS claimed responsibility, posting grisly pictures online of bodies and wreckage-strewn streets and saying the attack was aimed at government-allied Shiite militia fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Residents and Iraqi security forces gather around a hole caused by a suicide car attack at a market in Khan Bani Saad, north-east of Baghdad, on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The push by pro-government forces to retake Ramadi, which fell to IS militants in May, includes about 10,000 members of the Iraqi army, federal police and Shiite militias and Sunni tribal fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But they have struggled to gain ground against heavy resistance, including hundreds of booby traps and other defences built by a small but capable force of 250 to 350 IS fighters believed to be holed up in the city, about 100 kilometres west of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Progress has been steady but difficult," said Brigadier James Learmont, a British senior officer detailed to the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division as deputy commander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They've had time to prepare defences."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Islamic State propaganda channel shows "lion cubs" in training in northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>US and other coalition warplanes pummelled militant positions in the city and its outskirts with 29 air strikes on July 12, the first night of the offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But they sharply reduced the air attacks as it became more difficult to find viable targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Fighting was also reported near Fallujah, another major Sunni-dominated city in the Euphrates River valley that the militants captured in January 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fallujah is "like a wasps' nest", said Mowaffaq al-Rubaie, Iraq's former national security adviser and now an MP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>More than 100 people were killed in the suicide bombing of the mainly Shiite town of Khan Bani Saad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A government offensive in Anbar this year petered out without success, and it wasn't clear whether the use of Shiite irregular troops would succeed or lead to greater sectarian conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Anbar stretches from the Syrian, Jordanian and Saudi Arabian borders to the edge of Baghdad, and saw the heaviest US casualties during the eight-year US-led war in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The abrupt government defeat in Ramadi in May forced the White House to reassess its strategy for pushing IS back, and US President Barack Obama has offered only guarded assessments of the seesawing progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>At a White House news conference on Wednesday, Mr Obama said his goals for the end of his term in 2017 include ensuring "that we are on track to defeat [Islamic State], that they are much more contained and we're moving in the right direction there".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A member of the Iraqi security forces looks at the site of the Khan Bani Saad attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>US and Iraqi critics have urged the White House to authorise a more direct American role in the war, including putting US advisers into combat with Iraqi units and assigning forward air controllers to front lines to help direct air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>General Martin Dempsey, the outgoing chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who visited Baghdad on Saturday, questioned top commanders about whether the US should get directly involved in ground combat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I asked, 'Are we at that point?'" General Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Members of the Shiite militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Units march in Baghdad on July 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The commanders did confirm reports that efforts to train Iraqi troops are behind schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Coalition forces can train as many as 24,000 Iraqi troops a year, but only 9700 have gone through the training this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Brigadier Learmont said the shortfall was the result of Iraq's inability "to provide the trainees while constantly fighting" IS on multiple fronts in northern, western and central Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>General Dempsey said Iraq's Shiite-led government is rife with sectarian divisions and disagreements about who should take the lead in trying to retake Anbar, Iraq's regular army or the Popular Mobilisation Units, the mostly Shiite militias that are backed by Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Shiite militias initially took the lead in trying to retake Tikrit this year, but when a month-long offensive stalled they were ordered to pull back so US warplanes and Iraqi troops could move in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Human rights groups later accused some Shiite troops of extrajudicial killings and other sectarian abuses against the city's Sunni residents.</td></tr>
