<h3>One Direction to split up</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>THE teen sensations - featuring Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan - are set to part company for a year to focus on solo projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>THE British boy band One Direction will break up in March, according to a report in London's The Sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The teen idol sensations - featuring Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan - are set to part company for a year to focus on solo projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A 1D source told The Sun: "The guys have been together for five years, which is an incredible run for any boy band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They fully deserve to have at least a year to work on their own projects. There is absolutely no bad blood between them and they are all 100 per cent behind the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is definitely not a split and they fully intend to get back together at some time in the future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There is not to be a tour for the band's fifth album and the shock news could mean their last full concert will be at Sheffield's Motorpoint Arena on October 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Millions of fans may still get the chance to see their heart-throbs as a string of TV spots and performances already pencilled in before the end of the year are still expected to go ahead, it is claimed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The boys are to have a break over the festive period before getting back together to complete their promotional commitments for their record label in February, according to The Sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The plan had been on the cards "with or without Zayn" Malik, who left the group in March, an unnamed source told the tabloid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The source claimed: "Of course they would have preferred that he had stayed in the band but they would have taken this extended hiatus even if he hadn't left."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It is believed the break and the decision not to tour was rubberstamped in a meeting in London last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Zayn allegedly quit One Direction because of the endless touring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It means they could each take their money-spinning careers on very different journeys in talks that could get under way within weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There is "a lot of interest" in Styles from Hollywood, Tomlinson is "very much in contention to be a judge on X Factor" next year and all of them are now faced with "a massive amount of options", according to the source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It seems Payne may want to finetune his songwriting, producing and DJ skills rather than a solo career, the report says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In March the band spoke out to quash rumours they were set to split up in the wake of Malik's departure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The band vowed to continue as a four-piece after the shock departure of Malik, who said he wanted to live like a "normal" 22-year-old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A flood of reports then suggested the group were on the verge of breaking up but Payne thanked their devoted fans who are known as "directioners" for sticking with the band and "not thinking it's finished".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He tweeted: "I can see a lot of people thanking us for staying but you're the real Heros (sic) here thanks for not thinking it's finished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Bradford-born Malik quit after having been "signed off with stress".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It came amid reports he had cheated on his then-fiance and Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The couple have since split up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Malik is believed to be working on a solo album with acclaimed music producer Naughty Boy, who has worked with a string of hit-makers including Emeli Sande, Cheryl Cole and Leona Lewis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>One Direction have evolved into one of the greatest boy bands of all time.</td></tr>
