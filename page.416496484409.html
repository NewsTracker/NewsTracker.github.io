<h3>Software developers try on Apple watch, see more apps coming</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO, April 24 (Reuters) - Software developers who tried on an Apple Watch for the first time on Friday predicted a rush of new apps over the next few months, particularly in areas including health and messaging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Developers, who had been limited to using software simulators of the watch, discovered new possibilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ross Cohen, chief operating officer of BeenVerified.com, which makes a caller ID app for the watch, said he only realized on Friday that the watch goes on and off automatically as you raise or lower your wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The simulator did not have a microphone, leaving some developers to guess how well it could hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Having the watch on hand will speed development, said Danielle Keita-Taguchi, marketing analyst at Y Media Labs, which has designed apps for companies like American Express, EMC and eBay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"A lot of Fortune 500 companies really want to leverage this new technology quickly," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Health, transportation and social media will be the three main industries that will utilize the Apple Watch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tracking firm App Annie counted 3,061 total apps supporting Apple Watch on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some 10 percent were games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Productivity apps were 8 percent and lifestyle and health/fitness each accounted for 7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Notable absences included social network Facebook, message service Snapchat and any apps from Google Inc. A Google spokesperson said "only time will tell" if it would make any apps for Apple's device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Snapchat could not be reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earlier this week Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts who asked about the watch, "We're going to watch closely and build what our community wants us to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>So far developers see the watch's main benefits as saving time or the labor of frequently taking out a phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I've got my phone with me already, why do I also need the watch?" asked Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group, which backs a host of software companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"What is the extension benefit to having it on my wrist versus in my pocket?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>McIlwain's firm has invested in Redfin, the online real estate service, which has one answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Its Apple Watch app that let users find nearby homes for sale and dictate notes on homes visited.</td></tr>
