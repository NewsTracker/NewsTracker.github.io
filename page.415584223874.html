<h3>Netanyahu campaign pledge could cost Israel at UN</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The White House could "re-evaluate" its backing of Israel at the UN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied abandoning his commitment to a Palestinian state, but said conditions had made that possibility remote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In response to Prime Minister Netanyahu's re-election, Palestinians plan to resubmit a UN Security Council resolution to set a deadline for Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In December, the Council rejected a resolution that would have called for Israel's withdrawal by 2017, but this time around Palestinians could hope for previously unattainable support from the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Steps that the United States has taken at the United Nations had been predicated on this idea that the two-state solution is the best outcome," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Now our ally in these talks has said that they are no longer committed to that solution. That means we need to re-evaluate our position in this matter, and this is what we will do moving forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The day before Tuesday's elections, Netanyahu said he would not allow the establishment of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Those remarks had further damaged strained relations with the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution," Netanyahu told the US news channel MSNBC on Thursday, backing off his campaign promise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Netanyahu also called himself "proud to be the prime minister of all Israeli citizens - Arabs and Jews alike."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Tuesday, election day, he had triggered outrage by warning that Arabs had begun "turning out in droves" to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The United States had announced on Wednesday that multinational negotiations on Iran's nuclear program would not be affected by the prime minister's re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Netanyahu took a hard-line stance in the final days of campaigning, apparently seeking to draw voters away from smaller right-wing parties and rally them behind his nationalist Likud party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When asked the night before voters went to the polls if he could say that no Palestinian state would rise under his rule, Netanyahu had replied, "Indeed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Words matter and that is certainly true in this instance," the White House's Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On Thursday, President Mahmoud Abbas convened the top body of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Ramallah to discuss strategy with Netanyahu assuming a third consecutive term in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"What we heard recently is very worrying," Abbas told the PLO Executive Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Palestinian president called the Israeli government "not serious" about a two-state solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu says the Palestinian Authority should cut out Gaza Strip rulers Hamas and engage Israel in "genuine" peace talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The prime minister has begun laying the groundwork for forming his next government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu's victory will not hamper US efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, according to the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Israeli prime minister's right-wing Likud will hold about a quarter of Knesset seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looked likely to remain in the job after his Likud party clearly won the most seats in Israel's election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The international reaction has been mixed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu's election victory is bad news for American-Israeli ties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>With the man that has politicized the relationship unlike anyone before heading Israel's new government, the bilateral climate will remain icy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>After an expected change in leadership in Israel failed, the country's current prime minister is likely the next one, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That's not good news for Israel or the Mideast, says DW's Bettina Marx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>US President Barack Obama has called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to congratulate him on his electoral win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Obama also reiterated the US' support for a two-state solution in the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Following an initial vote count, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party look set for victory, ahead of the center-left Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A win would mean a third term in office for Netanyahu.</td></tr>
