<h3>Rangers beat Devils, win NHL's President's Trophy (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The postgame activity after the Rangers 4-2 win over the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night was businesslike, from congratulating goaltender Cam Talbot on the ice to talking about heading into the playoffs with home-ice advantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was good to get the job done, but there is more to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''It's not an easy thing to do,'' coach Alain Vigneault said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''You look at the teams still fighting to get into the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's a challenging thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For our group, it's one thing in the direction that we're looking to get to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I'm very proud of our group but we all know that we are going to be judged by what we do in the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>New York won't know who it wlll face in the opening round of the Eastern Conference playoffs, but Game 1 will be at Madison Square Garden next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Rangers never trailed against the Devils after getting goals from Kevin Hayes and Ryan McDonagh in a 47-second span in the first period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Talbot made 19 saves and James Sheppard and Carl Hagelin added third-period goals as the Rangers swept the four-game season series with New Jersey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''We battled hard all season long to get to this point but we know that the job's not finished yet,'' said Talbot, the backup who played a major role this season by posting a 17-5-3 record since Feb. 4, when starter Henrik Lunqvist was lost for nearly two months with a neck injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The win was the Rangers' fifth straight - four with Lundqvist in net - and it improved their record to 52-21-7 for 111 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 52-wins ties the franchise record and the point total is one less than that franchise mark, both set in 1993-94, the last time they won the Stanley Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''It is a great accomplishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Like any team, we had to handle adversity, injuries, ups and downs, travel, everything that goes about an NHL season,'' McDonagh said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''For us to clinch and say we won the regular season is a huge confidence boost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Patrik Elias and Steve Bernier scored and Cory Schneider made 36 saves in the Devils' final home game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Rangers will be looking to return to the Cup finals for the second straight year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They lost the final to the Los Angeles Kings last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Rangers never trailed in this game but it was nothing like Saturday's 6-1 rout of New Jersey in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Despite being outshot by a 40-21 margin and having to kill off seven penalties, the Devils were right in the game until Hagelin scored into an empty net with just under than 2 minutes to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Sheppard have given the Rangers a 3-1 lead midway through the third period, deflecting Dominic Moore's shot past Schneider for his seventh goal of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Bernier closed the gap to a goal less than a minute later, with a backhander that Talbot originally stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>As the puck lay in the crease, the goaltender and Derick Brassard scrambled to clear the puck but Talbot kicked it into his own net.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Talbot was outstanding earlier in the period, stopping Adam Henrique twice and and Scott Gomez in close with a backhander to preserve the Rangers' 2-1 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Hayes gave the Rangers the lead at 13:45 of the first period with his 16th goal of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Devils defenseman Eric Gelinas turned the puck over behind his net and Martin St. Louis poked the puck out front to Hayes for a shot past Schneider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>McDonagh doubled the margin less than a minute later with a goal just 7 seconds after Jacob Josefson was sent off for hooking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Derick Brassard won the ensuing faceoff, and Hayes and Keith Yandle moved the puck to the Rangers' captain from the left point that beat a well-screened Schneider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Devils, who had only two shots in the opening 17 minutes, got on the board with their third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>With Tanner Glass of the Rangers in the penalty box, Bernier found Elias alone between the circles for his 12th goal of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''I think we got in penalty trouble,'' Devils forward Mike Cammalleri said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''It's tough to get a flow and a momentum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Rangers had a two-man advantage for 1:27 in the opening minutes but only managed one shot on goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It foreshadowed a night in which they converted on 1 of 7 extra-man chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>NOTES: Rangers F Mats Zuccarello was scratched with general body soreness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Sheppard replaced him in the lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>... Injured Rangers D Kevin Klein, who has not played since Mar. 11, had X-rays and is coming along, Vigneault said before the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>... In addition to 1993-94, the Rangers also previously won the Presidents' Trophy for the 1991-92 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>... Devils C Stephen Gionta missed his third straight game with back spasms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>... Devils F Tuomo Ruutu played in his 700th NHL game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>... Devils Jacob Josefson was called for three of the team's seven penalties.</td></tr>
