<h3>Boko Haram leaves grave of throat-slit corpses near Damasak</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Soldiers from Niger and Chad who liberated the Nigerian town of Damasak from Boko Haram militants have discovered the bodies of at least 70 people, many with their throats slit, scattered under a bridge, a Reuters witness said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In what appeared to be an execution site for the Islamist group, the bodies were strewn beneath the concrete bridge on one of the main roads leading out of the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At least one was decapitated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau has allegedly pledged formal allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The bodies were partially mummified by the dry desert air, while grass has began to grow around the corpses, suggesting that the killings had taken place some time ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Boko Haram has killed thousands of people in a six-year insurgency aimed at establishing an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Damasak was seized by the Islamist group in November but recaptured by troops from Niger and Chad on Saturday as part of a multinational effort to wipe out the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chadian soldiers, who said the bodies were discovered on Thursday, spoke of at least 100 corpses in the area around the dry river bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Reuters witness was able to count at least 70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A strong smell of decomposition in many parts of town suggested there could be more bodies concealed there, the Reuters witness said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A trail of blackened blood was visible along the side of the bridge facing the bodies, suggesting they had been thrown off the side after being killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Among the dead was the imam of the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>All but around 50 of the town's residents had fled by the time Damasak was recaptured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Those who remained were mostly too old or too sick to leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"People were in town when they [Boko Haram] attacked, they fired at us, we ran away to the bushes but they continued to fire and chased some people to kill them," said Damasak resident Mbodou Moussa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Chad's military spokesman Colonel Azem Bermandoa said the Chadians had asked Nigeria's military to occupy the town, which lies close to the border with Niger, and would remain there until Nigerian troops arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The regional offensive was launched this year with Chad, Niger and Cameroon as Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and biggest economy, prepares for presidential elections on March 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At the start of this year, Boko Haram controlled around 20 local government areas, a territory the size of Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>With the help of its foreign allies, Nigeria's army said on Tuesday it had pushed the rebels out of all but three districts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Thursday, however, two security sources told Reuters that Boko Haram had killed at least 10 people in the town of Gamburu, on the border with Cameroon, demonstrating it can still attack civilians despite being forced into retreat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to tackle the insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>His challenger Muhammadu Buhari has campaigned on a reputation for toughness gained when he was military ruler of Nigeria in the 1980s.</td></tr>

<h3>Germany's SPD won't back down in U.S. trade talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"What the SPD doesn't want won't happen," Sigmar Gabriel, who is also Germany's deputy chancellor, told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in an interview published on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The European Commission is trying to prevent differences on arbitration from blocking the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which would encompass almost half the global economy and could generate $100 billion a year in additional economic output on both sides of the Atlantic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Many in Europe, including the European Parliament, fear U.S. multinationals will use a so-called investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism to challenge Europe's food, labour and environmental laws on the grounds that these restrict free commerce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The United States will not accept a deal without it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Unblocking the issue with a revamped form of ISDS could help negotiators reach a trade deal by the end of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom defended the ISDS mechanism this week, saying European companies needed it because U.S. law does not bar discrimination against foreign investors and that if ISDS were modernised, governments would not be bullied by big multinationals to change national laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gabriel appeared adamant that Europe should not accept what he termed the "privatisation" of arbitration, though he added that Malmstrom was helping to overcome scepticism about TTIP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We won't accept any pressure for further liberalisation or privatisation. We won't lower any social, environmental or consumer protection standards," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"And we will not -- I am completely sure of this -- see any privatisation of arbitration."</td></tr>
