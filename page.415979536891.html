<h3>High political stakes for Clinton on Iran nuclear agreement</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton can claim a piece of the victory if the U.S. and other world powers ultimately finalize a nuclear agreement with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the soon-to-be Democratic presidential candidate also will own a piece of the failure if the final negotiations fall apart or result in a weak deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton's statement after Thursday's tentative deal suggests that the former secretary of state knows that those are the stakes for her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The nuclear negotiations will figure prominently in the foreign policy debate in the 2016 presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton occupies a unique space on this issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As President Barack Obama's first secretary of state, she helped lay the groundwork for the diplomacy with Iran.</td></tr>
