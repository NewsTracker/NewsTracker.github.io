<h3>Apple Watch sales plummet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sales of the Apple Watch have fallen by 90 per cent since the gadget was released in April, research has shown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While Apple has not yet released official figures, a report by market research firm Slice Intelligence claims sales of the iWatch, which starts at 299, dipped to 4,000 a day last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This is far less than the 200,000 a day sold in its first week - and the 10million iPhone 6 handsets snapped up during the weekend after they were released.</td></tr>
