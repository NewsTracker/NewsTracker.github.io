<h3>Female intuition: Spotting Moroccan music talent</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"You live it on both sides, with the crowd and with the artists," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It's the nicest feeling you can ever have to be backstage. Imagine seeing 10,000 people singing a song that you worked on. It's like having a baby actually - you make it, you see it growing up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Haddadi got into the business five years ago when she saw her artist friends struggling to make a living from their music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She realised there was a lack of managers and agents and seized the opportunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I believe that the biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams - and my dream was to inspire and to help others," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The music industry is not yet taken seriously as a career in Morocco, says Haddadi, who comes from a family of engineers and doctors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Despite their reservations, her family supported her and she went out and got her first client, DJ Van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She didn't tell him that she was just 18 and still at school - she pretended to be 21.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The bluff worked, and Van asked her to produce his album.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It was her first project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Not a single, not a tour, not a booking - an album," says Haddadi proudly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Now I don't prove myself any more. It's not ego, but I know I'm the best."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"As a woman I get a lot of sexual harassment - not from my artists, but from other artists in the business, from partners in the business, even from fans," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The biggest challenge has been to be taken seriously in this "exclusive men's club".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most male musicians cannot accept that a woman might tell them what to do - their pride will not allow it, says Haddadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When she approached a big Moroccan artist - she doesn't mention his name - he told her he could never employ her as a manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I cannot give my career, my life to a woman. I cannot do that," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The turning point came when she realised she had to think differently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"If you want people to stop judging you as a woman in this business, stop judging yourself as a woman. Judge yourself as a manager, not as a female manager. Judge yourself on how you can push your artists to the limits."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Now that she has an established group of artists who trust her, the next hurdle is to build up the Moroccan music industry as a whole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The biggest problem we have is distribution," says Haddadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"You can make music, but where are you going to sell that product? I would love my artists to have their rights, their royalties" - and not just so that she can get her percentage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"To have a productive artist he needs to wake up every morning not worrying about how he's going to pay his rent, he just needs to wake up and think about his art."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She has chosen not to accept an offer of work in the US, but to stay in Morocco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I hope one day I can say I made the right choice," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I have the chance to earn my living by living my dreams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I think I have the best job in the world - if I can take just one song from one of my artists, and pour it in the ears of just one person, and they feel the positivity from the song, then I will leave my mark on this world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Haddidi says the situation for women of her generation has progressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Over the past 10 years Moroccan women have become more independent, they earn money, they party. I go nightclubbing with my friends, in a female group - it's not a problem."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Moroccan women can travel alone, they can vote, run for election, can do business, be independent, says Haddidi - but these rules don't apply to all levels of society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Poorer women still live in a traditional society where "she gets a lot of sexual harassment on the street because she is wearing jeans", she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Now we are dealing with radical Islam - women are the devil. But I will say we are really lucky if you compare with other countries."</td></tr>

<h3>Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov wrote notes the day before he was shot dead</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, was gunned down as he walked with his Ukrainian girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya on Friday night near Red Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in Russia during Russian President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Former Russian deputy prime minister and opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was shot dead near the Kremlin last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In his final note before his death, Mr Nemstov is claimed to have written about how he heard Russian paratroopers had been fighting in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now it has emerged that the day before his death, Mr Nemtsov and close aide Olga Shorina were discussing a sensitive investigation he was preparing into Moscow's backing for separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But fearing that his conversations with Ms Shorina were being listened in on by the Kremlin, he resorted to writing instead of talking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In his final note, which has been shown to Reuters, Mr Nemtsov wrote: 'Some paratroopers from Ivanovo have got in touch with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ms Shorina said: 'He did not want to say anything, just in case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, it has not been possible to independently confirm the authenticity of the handwritten note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ms Shorina added that Mr Nemtsov has planned to publish one million copies of his report on Ukraine, in order to reach as wide an audience as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She explained that most of the material gathered for his report was from open sources, and that he had not been intending to reveal any explosive new information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However she said in the course of his research, he had been contacted by relatives of a group of Russian soldiers, who according to him has been in action in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He claimed they were the serviceman who were based in Ivanovo, a city 185 miles north east of Moscow, which houses units of the Russian military's 98th paratroop division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Shorina added: 'He was maintaining contact with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Nemtsov's mother, secretary and daughter pay their last respects at Mr Nemtsov's funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The aide said she and another Nemtsov associate, Ilya Yashin, would try to salvage the information Mr Nemtsov had been gathering and attempt to publish the report in a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But as far as she was aware, he had only managed to write down a table of contents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She said that for previous reports, Mr Nemtsov had stored most of the information in his head, and would dictate it to her when he was ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Meanwhile, Mr Yashin said he and Mr Nemtsov had spoken about the Ukraine report about a day and a half before his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said: 'He told me he had been in touch with relatives of Russian soldiers killed there and he was planning a trip to Ivanovo to talk to the parents of those killed soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Since last summer, reports have been circulating inside the country that many serving Russian troops have died in combat in eastern Ukraine, where the separatist war has killed more than 6,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>However, Moscow adamantly denies sending arms or troops to the region, saying any Russians fighting in Ukraine are volunteers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mr Nemtsov's death came a week ago when after dining next to Red Sqaure, the 55-year-old was shot four times in the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Putin has called his death a shameful tragedy, and the Kremlin has denied any involvement.</td></tr>
