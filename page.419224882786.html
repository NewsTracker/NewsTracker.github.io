<h3>Flight MH17: possible parts of missile system found at Ukraine crash site</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dutch prosecutors have said for the first time that they have found parts that could belong to a Buk missile system at the site in eastern Ukraine where Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was brought down last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The announcement represents the first time prosecutors have confirmed possible physical evidence of a missile bringing down the plane and killing all 298 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The prosecutors, who are leading an international criminal inquiry into the crash on 17 July last year, said in a statement that the parts "are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Though prosecutors have previously said a missile strike is the most likely explanation for the crash, they have never revealed they are in possession of possible missile parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, they cautioned that the conclusion could not yet be drawn "that there is a causal connection between the discovered parts and the crash of flight MH17".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prosecutors will now enlist the help of weapons and forensics experts to further investigate the suspected missile parts, said spokesman Wim de Bruin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He declined to give more details of the parts - found during Dutch recovery missions to the crash site - that are under investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dutch authorities have conducted several missions to the site to recover human remains, victims' belongings and parts of the downed Boeing 777.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was heading from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was brought down over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Russian-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces have blamed one another for shooting down the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both sides deny responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A report by the Dutch Safety Board into the cause of the crash is expected by the end of October, while the separate international criminal investigation is likely to take months more to complete.</td></tr>
