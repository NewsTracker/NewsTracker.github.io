<h3>2-time plane crash survivor Austin Hatch now a student aide (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ANN ARBOR, Mich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Austin Hatch, who survived two deadly airplane crashes and went on to suit up for Michigan, is giving up playing basketball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Michigan coach John Beilein announced Monday the Big Ten approved a medical exemption waiver that will allow Hatch keep his scholarship and serve as an undergraduate student assistant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''Basketball has always been a huge part of my life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, it is what I play, not who I am,'' Hatch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It was a goal of mine to return to the game that I love so much and I feel very blessed to have the opportunity to play for Michigan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hatch spent eight weeks in a coma with a brain injury after a 2011 crash that killed his father and stepmother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The single-engine Beechcraft A36 Bonanza flew into a garage near Charlevoix Municipal Airport in northern Michigan, about 10 days after Hatch verbally committed to play for Michigan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A 2003 crash killed his mother, brother and sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His father, Dr. Stephen Hatch, was the pilot both times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hatch, a 6-foot-6 guard, played a total of five minutes over five games as a freshman last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He attempted two 3-point shots and made 1 of 3 free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''As I have progressed through this first season, I know that I am not where I want to be, both academically and athletically,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''My priority is academics, and I feel that it is in my best interest to devote more time to my studies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hatch grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but went to live with his uncle in Southern California in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''I don't want to be known by the time my career comes to an end here as just 'a cool story,''' he said early last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''Obviously what happened to me is kind of unique, but that is what happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That is not who I am.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Beilein said he had been discussing a switch from player to undergraduate assistant the last few months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said it's in Hatch's best interest to go on the medical scholarship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''This change allows Austin to devote the necessary time he needs to be successful in his studies and obtain a Michigan degree,'' Beilein said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''We also wanted to be sure we continued our commitment to Austin keeping his full scholarship in place for the next three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Beilein said Hatch can continue to be a valuable member of the team as a leader, mentor and assistant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said Hatch would travel with the team when it fits into his academic schedule.</td></tr>
