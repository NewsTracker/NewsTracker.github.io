<tr><td>4</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Baltimore's chief prosecutor, just 35 years old and on the job for less than four months, is facing the biggest challenge of her career: deciding whether evidence supports criminal charges against police officers in the death of Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby ousted an established white opponent by promising to hold police accountable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She accused him of being too cozy with officers and too out of touch with the citizens of Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mosby and her husband, a Baltimore city councilman, are black and live just blocks from the poverty-stricken community where riots broke out Monday following Gray's funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But even her supporters say Mosby's close ties to the community won't save her from criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"She better be ready. It's going to be baptism by fire," said J.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wyndal Gordon, a longtime defense attorney in Baltimore who has litigated against officers in excessive-force cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"How she will handle this will define her administration and the future of that office."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Six officers have been suspended with pay while Mosby decides what to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Police gave her their internal report Thursday, but her office is conducting its own investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She has not announced a timetable for her decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mosby grew up in Boston and met her husband, Councilman Nick Mosby, while they were students at Tuskegee University in Alabama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After clerking at U.S. Attorney's offices in Boston and Washington, she joined the Baltimore State's Attorney's Office in 2005 and moved up the ranks before leaving to work for an insurance company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She defeated incumbent Gregg Bernstein, who outraised her three-to-one, in last June's Democratic primary, and faced only write-in opposition in the general election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Her official biography declares that "she is the youngest chief prosecutor of any major city in America."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I think it's very unique that a chief prosecutor who - as young as she is, who lives in a community that has a high amount of violence - that's very unique and she's probably the only one in the entire country," Nick Mosby said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"She's from the inner city, she lives in the inner city, she knows the inner city."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mosby has three legal options: charge the officers, decline to charge them or seek a grand jury indictment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Practically speaking, she is almost certain to seek an indictment, said Andrew Levy, a Baltimore defense attorney and an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland School of Law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Charging the officers without going to a grand jury would require Mosby's office to persuade a judge that there is probable cause that a crime was committed, a procedural step prosecutors often avoid in high-profile cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Declining to charge the officers could be seen as a betrayal by the protesters who have flooded city streets since Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mosby could present a grand jury with a menu of potential charges including assault, involuntary or voluntary manslaughter, or even murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Juries in Baltimore criminal trials tend to be distrustful of police officers, an attitude that could work in Mosby's favor if she decides the officers committed crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"The conventional wisdom would be that a Baltimore city grand jury would not be reluctant to indict a police officer," Levy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Some of her critics say her campaign pledges and political success could compromise justice in the Gray case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Warren Brown, a veteran Baltimore defense attorney who supported Mosby's opponent, said the prosecutor's decision would be inextricably linked to her and her husband's political aspirations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He said Mosby is being pressured to indict the officers on murder or voluntary manslaughter charges in Gray's death, which he doesn't think the evidence supports.</td></tr>
