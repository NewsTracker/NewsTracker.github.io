<h3>Google Gives Up on Google+ as a Facebook Rival</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google executive Brad Horowitz announced a "pivot" away from Google + as a social network on July 27, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google put the final nail in the coffin of its ambition to make Google+ a real competitor to Facebook , Twitter and other leading social networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Brad Horowitz, who took the reins of Google+ earlier this year , said Monday that users will no longer need a Google+ account to engage with others on Google products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Instead, any Google email or account will do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google launched Google+ four years ago, seeking to create a big social network with a billion or more people updating their status, posting photos and keeping in touch with friends, family and colleagues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company wanted it to be a "platform layer" that unified Google's sharing models, as well as a product and a mobile app, Horowitz explained in a (yes, you guessed it) Google+ update.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This was a well-intentioned goal, but as realized it led to some product experiences that users sometimes found confusing," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among the most confusing - and irritating - was a requirement that a user have a Google+ account and profile to log into many other Google services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The most notable rant came in late 2013 when Google imposed this requirement on YouTube viewers, who had been posting comments on the video site for years before Google+ was even a glimmer in Larry Page's eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Why the f- do I need a google+ account to comment on a video," YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim wrote on his YouTube page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fittingly, YouTube is one of the first places where Google is yanking this requirement, according to a Google blog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>YouTube told users that they won't need a Google+ account to upload videos, create channels or to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"They thought they could muscle their way to becoming the next big social network," said Aaron Goldman, chief marketing officer of 4C Insights, a social-media data firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"They are finally figuring out what this is."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Former Google+ head Vic Gundotra said in late 2013 that Google+ had 300 million monthly active users, although exactly how active these people were was always questioned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At the time, Facebook had over one billion monthly actives and it has more than 1.4 billion now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Horowitz said Google+ will focus on connecting users around specific interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His said his team is now called SPS, which stands for Streams, Photos and Sharing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>For example, Google Photos, a photo- and video-storage service launched earlier this year, lets users share however they'd like - without a Google+ profile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Other things people often share on social networks, like their location, are being moved to other Google apps like the messaging and video-chat service Hangouts, Google said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"In the coming months, a Google Account will be all you'll need to share content, communicate with contacts, create a YouTube channel and more, all across Google," the company said.</td></tr>
