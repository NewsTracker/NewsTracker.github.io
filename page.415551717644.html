<h3>Netanyahu vows to 'ensure welfare, security' of Israelis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Wednesday to ensure the "welfare and security" of Israelis, after his rightwing Likud party won a resounding general election victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I will do everything I can to ensure the welfare and security of all the citizens of Israel, and God willing, we will succeed and prosper," he said at Jerusalem's Western Wall -- the holiest site at which Jews can pray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I am thrilled by the weight of responsibility the people of Israel have placed on my shoulders," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I appreciate this decision of the citizens of Israel to elect me and my partners against all chances and against great forces," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Likud rallied to take 30 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament) after Tuesday's vote, having been several seats behind the centre-left Zionist Union in polls published just days ahead of the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Zionist Union secured 24 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>President Reuven Rivlin will still need to decide which party leader has the best chance of forming a coalition government, under Israel's proportional voting system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Netanyahu looks best-placed to do so, given almost guaranteed support from smaller rightwing and religious parties, and possible backing from centre-right Kulanu, whose leader Moshe Kahlon is expected to play the role of kingmaker.</td></tr>
