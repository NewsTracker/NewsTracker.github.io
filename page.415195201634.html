<h3>India bans rapist's TV interview blaming women for sexual assaults</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>During the interview Mukesh Singh said Indian women have only themselves to blame if they venture out at night and attract the unwanted attention of others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Singh was the driver of the bus the night Jyoti Singh boarded with her friend after a night out at the cinema.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 23-year-old was raped and beaten with iron bars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She later died from her injuries in an incident that prompted widespread demonstrations across India and outrage around the world.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>British filmmaker Leslie Ukwin produced the documentary "India's Daughter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I got an insight and an understanding into the way he (Mukesh Singh, one of the convicts in the gang rape case) views women and that is what is extremely shocking. Not what he did but what he thinks that led him to do what he did and it's not just he who thinks that. It is a societal problem," said Ukwin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>India, where many people have long believed that women are responsible for rape, was shocked into action after the 2012 attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Singh and three other men were convicted in 2013.</td></tr>
