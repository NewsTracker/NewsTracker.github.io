<h3>Apple Music promises revolution, but traditional DJs are what set it apart</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's an old-fashioned concept remade for the mobile era: human DJs beaming out songs to people all over the world listening on their smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Real-time radio, of all things, is what truly distinguishes the newest and splashiest streaming service, Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The nuts and bolts of the service, which launched Tuesday after a breathless promotional run-up filled with promises of revolution, are fundamentally similar to those of competitors such as Tidal or Spotify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple has about 30 million songs to stream at your request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You type in "Duran Duran" and tap on "Hungry Like the Wolf," and you're in business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If you choose to stay after a free three-month trial, it'll cost you $9.99 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Apple has Beats 1, a live Internet radio station built into its app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Complete with high-profile DJs and programmed shows, it sets the service apart from the pack and best illustrates Apple's ambition - to become a destination spot not unlike media giants of yore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>When Zane Lowe, the former BBC personality now working as the voice of Beats 1, played AC/DC's "For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)" in his debut show Tuesday morning, everyone who tuned in to the station heard it at the same time - a simple but radical disruption of the individualized listening experience we've become accustomed to online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's in essence the opposite of what Apple Music's predecessor, the iTunes Store, did more than a decade ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>By now you're familiar with unbundling, that digital-age process whereby songs, movies and television networks have been loosened from the tyrannical grip that record labels and cable providers once exerted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thanks to YouTube, nobody has to sit through a bunch of weak album tracks to hear a great single; thanks to HBO Now, nobody has to pay Time Warner hundreds of dollars to watch "True Detective."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mixing and matching from here and there, we've all become our own chief content officers, each of us the president of MTMe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Of course, Apple and its many competitors have been major players in the Great Unbundling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But with their sleek design, exclusive tracks and carefully curated playlists, these services now aim to be more than a mere utility serving a user's immediate need.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They want you to come and listen - and then stay for more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Given its pull as the world's most powerful music retailer, Apple has some content the other platforms don't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Taylor Swift, for instance, is famously allowing her album "1989" to be streamed here and nowhere else; ditto "The Chronic" by Dr. Dre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There are music videos too, which Spotify doesn't offer (though some other services do).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And Apple Music pulls in whatever songs you've purchased from iTunes in a fairly intuitive way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But with the shared experience of Beats 1, we're meant to listen together minus the fragmented self-determination that drives so much of our music consumption today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The novelty is exciting, which doesn't mean it's perfect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>For one thing, there's the matter of time zones, which Beats 1 blithely disregards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Yet the Californian's getting-ready-for-a-night-out is the Frenchman's climbing-miserably-out-of-bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>How to properly soundtrack both at once?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>For another, Lowe is relentlessly optimistic about the value of new music - and of his importance to its dispersal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That's great when he's playing something you're glad to have discovered, like "We Try But We Don't Fit In," a tender, fuzzy guitar-pop tune by the band Day Wave, unknown to me until Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But when he's crowing about Apple's being the only place to hear a lackluster new Pharrell Williams track - and then playing the song twice in a row - you might find yourself longing for your old digital silo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>(Other Beats 1 DJs include Ebro Darden and Julie Adenuga, while pop stars such as Elton John and Ellie Goulding have signed on to present shows as well.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Apple Music emphasizes discovery in other ways, including a vast collection of branded playlists assembled by various tastemakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Pitchfork, the popular indie-rock website, has one called "Cantankerous Singer-Songwriter Dudes," which should give you an indication of the breadth of options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But nothing about those, at least as I experienced them over 36 hours of clicking, made me want to stick around the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>At this point in streaming music's development, ultra-specific playlists are commodities - not to mention something of a distraction from what appears to be Apple's core mission here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>I'm more interested in seeing if the world's richest company can bundle the world back up.</td></tr>
