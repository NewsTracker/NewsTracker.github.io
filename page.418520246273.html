<h3>Global stocks uneven as focus on Greece, China drop</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Global stock markets were uneven Tuesday as investors digested the details and possible risks in Greece's preliminary rescue deal and China's main index fell after three days of gains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Oil prices fluctuated on news that Iran, a big crude producer, had struck a deal on its nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>KEEPING SCORE: In early trading, Germany's DAX fell 0.4 percent to 11,439.23 and France's CAC 40 shed 0.2 percent to 4,990.84.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.2 percent to 6,722.57.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Wall Street, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 were off 0.1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>GREECE RESPITE: Greece struck a preliminary rescue deal with other European Union governments that should avert an imminent financial catastrophe but guarantees years more hardship for its people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The agreement removes the immediate threat Greece would default on its debts and leave the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But in exchange for a three-year loan program, the Greek prime minister has to persuade skeptical legislators to pass tax increases and other key demands into law by Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>ANALYST'S TAKE: "Whether Greece has walked the plank to an economic and political collapse is still unknown," said Bernard Aw of IG Markets in a report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"While the agreement is definitely very positive for market sentiments, as the prospects of Grexit have significantly reduced, this does not mean the odds are eliminated in the medium term. Firstly, Greek lawmakers still need to pass the measures agreed upon into legislation. Secondly, political instability may surface if Tsipras loses his majority and a unity government is required. We would see a difficult road ahead. For now, calmer waters."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>ASIA'S DAY: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 1.5 percent to 20,385.33 and Sydney's S&P ASX 200 advanced 1.9 percent to 5,577.40.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>The Shanghai Composite Index still is down more than 20 percent from its June 12 peak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>State-owned brokerages and government pension funds have pledged to buy stocks, and executives and big shareholders are barred from selling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hundreds of companies have suspended trading in their shares.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Analysts say it is unclear whether the market can hold up once temporary barriers to selling are relaxed.</td></tr>
