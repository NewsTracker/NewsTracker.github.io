<h3>Kristen Stewart addresses her sexuality: ‘Google me, I’m not hiding’</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kristen Stewart has addressed months of speculation about her sexuality following reports that she was in a relationship with another woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But when asked by Nylon Magazine if she was out, her answer was more ambiguous: "Google me, I'm not hiding".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Stewart refused to define her sexuality as anything other than fluid, telling the magazine she believed society would be less rigid about defining sexuality as essentially gay or straight within the next few years.</td></tr>
