<h3>Remains of Germanwings crash victims head home</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PARIS - Dozens of relatives of victims of the Germanwings crash in the French Alps are awaiting the return of remains of their loved ones, roughly 2-1/2 months after the disaster killed all 150 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A total of 44 coffins were expected to be flown Tuesday from Marseille, France, to Duesseldorf, Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Germanwings' parent Lufthansa has said other remains will be repatriated by month's end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Elmar Giemulla, a lawyer for families of 34 victims, said many relatives "don't want to realize that their children are dead. It will be brutal when they see the coffins tomorrow, but it is necessary, because they need closure."</td></tr>
