<h3>Tunisia fires police chiefs over attacks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tunisia is aiming to restore faith in its tourism sector by reopening the National Bardo Museum less than a week after a jihadist attack there that killed 20 foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Museum officials said Tuesday's reopening, which will be marked with a ceremony, was "a message" to the gunmen who killed the tourists and a police officer there last Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's a challenge but also a message... we want to show that they haven't achieved their goal," museum curator Moncef Ben Moussa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The museum is due to reopen with a ceremony organised by the culture ministry, including a concert by the Tunis symphony orchestra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tunisia fears that last week's carnage claimed by the Islamic State group - the deadliest assault on foreigners in the North African country since 2002 - will hit its vital tourism sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a move aimed at restoring confidence, Prime Minister Habib Essid sacked the heads of police for Tunis and the area around the museum, after finding "several deficiencies" in security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Essid, himself a former interior minister, "decided to fire a number of officials including the Tunis police chief and the police chief for the Bardo".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A policeman in charge of security at the museum has been arrested, judiciary spokesman Sofiene Sliti said, without disclosing the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Bardo attack was the first claimed by IS in Tunisia after the militant group's apparent expansion to strife-torn Libya from its Syria and Iraq strongholds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With feeble growth and a graduate unemployment rate of 30 per cent, Tunisia relies heavily on tourist income.</td></tr>
