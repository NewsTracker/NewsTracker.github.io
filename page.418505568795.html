<h3>U.S. FTC exploring Apple Rules for Streaming Music Rivals in App Store</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Javascript needs to be enabled in your browser to use Yahoo Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO July 10 (Reuters) - U.S. government antitrust regulators are looking into claims about whether Apple&#x2019;s treatment of rival streaming music apps is illegal under antitrust law, according to three industry sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple recently launched a new music streaming service, Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It also provides the App Store platform for competing streaming services including Jango, Spotify, Rhapsody and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple takes a 30 percent cut of all in-app purchases for digital goods, such as music streaming subscriptions and games, sold on its platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While $9.99 has emerged as the going monthly rate for music subscriptions, including Apple&#x2019;s, some streaming companies complain that Apple&#x2019;s cut forces them to either charge more in the App Store than they do on other platforms or erode their profit margins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Federal Trade Commission is looking at the issue but has not begun a formal investigation, said the three industry sources, who requested anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The agency has had meetings with multiple concerned parties, one source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The agency meets with companies routinely, and a formal investigation may not materialize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Antitrust lawyers interviewed by Reuters were divided on whether Apple&#x2019;s policies had the makings of an antitrust violation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The FTC also declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As all-you-can-eat music subscriptions become more popular among listeners, a wave of companies have rushed in to cater to the demand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Apple has long been a leader in digital music through its iTunes Store, but it has been a relatively late entrant to on-demand streaming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Streaming services&#x2019; chief grievances with Apple stem from the company&#x2019;s 30 percent cut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>To avoid it, customers can sign up for a streaming service through their Web browser, but the streaming industry sources argue that many consumers do not realize that is an option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tyler Goldman, CEO for North America of the music streaming company Deezer, said the bite that Apple takes out of his company&#x2019;s $9.99 U.S. subscription fee leaves little for Deezer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>&#x201C;It will be an issue for the industry going forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>You can either raise your prices and not be competitive with Apple&#x2019;s price, or you can have no margin,&#x201D; he said, adding that he was unaware of whether Deezer has talked to the FTC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Two of the industry sources say that the antitrust concerns focus on restrictions in the App Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>These include a prohibition on advertising in the app that the company is on other platforms, a ban on marketing in the app that consumers can also buy directly from the company&#x2019;s website, and a ban on linking to a company&#x2019;s website from within the app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>These restrictions apply to all apps, not just music streaming apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Although Google also offers a music subscription service and charges a 30 percent transaction fee in its app store, its policies for app sales have drawn less ire from rival streaming services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Industry sources say the company places fewer restrictions on those transactions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Although Apple dominates the digital music business primarily through iTunes, its share of the global smartphone market is relatively small.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Google&#x2019;s Android operating system accounts for 78.9 percent, with Apple&#x2019;s iOS system clocking in at 17.9 percent, according to research firm Gartner based on sales in the first quarter of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Antitrust lawyers knowledgeable about the tech industry were split on whether Apple&#x2019;s policies violated antitrust law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Apple is free to charge whatever fee it likes for transactions in the App Store, some argue, and companies do not have to sell their goods there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It is legal to have a monopoly but it is not legal for monopolies to use their clout to hurt competitors, said Jeffrey Jacobovitz of the law firm Arnall Golden Gregory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Apple&#x2019;s critics may be seeking to convince the FTC to use Section Five of the FTC Act, which prohibits &#x201C;unfair or deceptive acts or practices,&#x201D; to pursue Apple, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Since the Justice Department&#x2019;s successful prosecution of Apple for colluding with publishers to push up the prices of ebooks, the FTC may be inclined to take a closer look at Apple&#x2019;s involvement in the music business, said Jacobovitz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Another antitrust lawyer dismissed most of the concerns as companies complaining about actions that were undoubtedly aggressive, but still legal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re (Apple) tough business people,&#x201D; said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
