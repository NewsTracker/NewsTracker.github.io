<tr><td>7</td><td>TAJI, Iraq (AP) - As the U.S. mission to Iraq expands, so do its efforts to arm and train the country's security forces to combat the Islamic State group, with large-scale operations continuing to recapture territory from the Sunni militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hundreds of American advisers are working at the Camp Taji military base just north of Baghdad to train Iraqi forces on issues like weaponry and better coordination and integration of ground action with coalition airstrikes.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>In November, President Barack Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could more than double the total of U.S. forces to 3,100.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The boost in advisers and trainers complements the air campaign launched by the U.S. in August 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Iraqi military has struggled to recover from its collapse in June when the Islamic State group captured country's second-largest city, Mosul, and swept over much of northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In the face of the advance, commanders disappeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pleas for more ammunition went unanswered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In some cases, soldiers stripped off their uniforms and ran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Twelve U.S. advisory teams had been operating in Iraq since August, stationed in joint operations centers in Baghdad and Irbil, as well as in some of the outer provinces, including volatile Anbar province, which has been under partial control of the militant group since early 2014.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>It's one of the first major operations in which the U.S.-led coalition is not taking part, with U.S. officials saying they weren't ask to participate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Iranian advisers have played a prominent role on the front lines of Iraq's Salahuddin province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If Iraqi forces are unable to push IS back and recover lost territory, Obama would be faced with a choice of accepting failure in Iraq or committing U.S. combat troops - something both U.S. and Iraqi officials have spoken firmly against.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>Operations to recapture Tikrit have been on hold for nearly a week, with Iraqi officials saying they're trying to minimize casualties by not rushing the final assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>At the provincial military headquarters, Iraqi soldiers sleep four to a room and pass the downtime by playing backgammon or volleyball - no soccer fields are available - or by listening to music.</td></tr>

<tr><td>34</td><td>Across the grounds of the university-turned-command center, several bodies lay decomposing on the pavement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The unburied corpses are allegedly of Islamic State militants, and senior military officials say they are kept there to raise fighter morale and remind them of victories past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"My wife and my kids were crying when I left, but I told them I am not afraid," said Amjad Ali Karim, a 31-year-old member of the militias.</td></tr>
