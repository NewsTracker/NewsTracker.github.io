<h3>Hillary Clinton email trove reviewed for release, security</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton's extensive use of private emails has raised questions in the buildup to her expected presidential run about whether she adhered to the letter or spirit of accountability laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The official said the department would review 55,000 pages of emails amassed from Clinton's personal files to determine if there were any instances where she improperly transmitted sensitive information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The official was not authorized to be quoted on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>State Department policy holds that information that is not classified as secret but contains sensitive national security or diplomatic information can only be conveyed on secure channels except for certain circumstances, the official explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton's extensive use of private emails heightened security risks for her communications, chiefly the potential for inadvertent disclosure of such sensitive information and danger from hackers, several information security experts told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia, said Thursday his department "will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Officials said Thursday the review could take months to complete, potentially a drawn-out distraction for Clinton and an unnerving development for the many Democrats who see her as the party's presidential nominee-in-waiting for 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The review was prompted by the disclosure that Clinton, in a departure from predecessors, relied exclusively on the private account for emails about government business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The emails were sent from a private computer server using an Internet address that traces back to Clinton's family home in Chappaqua, New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The department announced the review soon after Clinton addressed the matter for the first time, saying on Twitter: "I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clinton aides and the State Department both say she never received or transmitted classified information on her private email account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But unclassified diplomatic details and internal matters are sometimes considered sensitive and can be targeted by hackers and foreign governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"She had other ways of communicating through classified email through her assistants or her staff," said Marie Harf, speaking for the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Officials have said Clinton turned over more than 55,000 pages of emails to the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clinton's use of a private email account for official business appeared to contradict instructions from her own office in June 2011 to all State Department employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In a cable from Clinton's office, employees were advised to "avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It cited reports that unspecified "online adversaries" were targeting personal email accounts of State Department employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The cable was first obtained by Fox News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The State Department told the AP that Clinton's instructions in 2011 only applied to emails containing "sensitive but unclassified" information, a category that includes personal information about employees or the public, business secrets, details of ongoing investigations or records about visa or asylum applications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Only one instruction in the cable directly referred to rules about such information, an existing ban on anyone auto-forwarding government emails to their personal accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Even though the instructions bore Clinton's name, it was not clear whether she wrote them or was aware of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Virtually every cable leaving the department's headquarters in Washington would have had Clinton's name on it while she was in town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Clinton's private email practices gave her significant control over access to her message archives, highly unusual in government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They also could complicate the State Department's legal responsibilities in finding and turning over official emails in response to any investigations, lawsuits or public records requests.</td></tr>
