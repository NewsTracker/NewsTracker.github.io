<h3>CIA spy 'fired for falling in love with undercover colleague 21 years his junior' sues agency for $25 million</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The officer filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the pseudonym Mack L. Charles in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Charles' lawsuit alleges that he had a solid record as a CIA officer, reaching the bureaucratic equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in the military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He served in a war zone, won awards and received good ratings, the lawsuit says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But he ran afoul of his bosses after he filed an age discrimination complaint in 2009, the lawsuit says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His complaint asserted that managers sought to impede his romantic relationship with another CIA non-official cover officer - 21 years his junior - who became his fiancee, the suit says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The pair had planned to spy overseas together as a 'tandem couple,' but haven't spoken to her since his firing, the lawsuit says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In March 2011, Charles claims that a senior manager 'took the monstrous step' of ordering the woman to cease all contact with him, threatening her with an assignment at CIA headquarters in Washington if she disobeyed, effectively an end to her career overseas, reports the Daily Beast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The suit also accuses the CIA of illegally barring the former officer from publishing his novel, tentatively titled Madhouse: A Forbidden Novel of The CIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The CIA faces occasional employment lawsuits like any other government agency, but this one is unusual because of the plaintiff's claim to have been a non-official cover officer, or NOC, in CIA parlance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Most CIA case officers work out of embassies posing as diplomats, giving them a level of protection should they be arrested while committing espionage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>NOCs pose as businessmen, scholars or scientists in an effort to distance them from the U.S. government and afford them access to people who would never set foot in a U.S. embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If caught spying overseas, they could be jailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The NOC program is even more secretive than traditional espionage, and officers who participate often operate using their real names instead of aliases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The CIA allocated billions of dollars to expanding the NOC program after 9/11, but the effort was largely a failure, former officers have said - a charge Charles repeats in his lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The suit says the leader of the CIA's Global Deployment Initiative - its main non-official cover program - tried to get Charles fired in 2009, but a CIA board declined to take that step.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After that, the lawsuit says, another senior officer, who headed the Special Activities Division - the CIA's paramilitary arm - wrote a memo alleging that Charles had in the past fudged expense accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That allegation is false, the lawsuit claims, but it says the allegation led to Charles' termination in December 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled against Charles' discrimination complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The lawsuit alleges that the officer who wrote the memo, who is not identified by name, had a 'checkered career' that included a drinking problem, and was asked to retire amid sexual harassment allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When he submitted his novel to the CIA's Publication Review Board, the lawsuit says, Charles was told he could not publish any of it for fear his true name, which he used while working undercover for the CIA, would be revealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The suit notes that at least one other former NOC has published a book under a pseudonym, Ishmael Jones, while keeping his true name a secret.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Jones did so without seeking permission from the CIA, leading the agency to obtain a court ruling in 2012 seizing the proceeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Charles and his supporters are asking the public for financial donations to help fund his legal battle and have setup a GoFundMe.com page.</td></tr>

<h3>Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey threatened by Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Islamic State has declared a new target in its war on the West -- a co-founder of Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Twitter has routinely shut down Islamic State social media accounts, particularly those that threaten or link to beheadings and other atrocities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The militant group, also known as ISIL or ISIS, posted an online threat on Sunday warning Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey that "your virtual war on the internet will cause a real war on you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Twitter issued a one-sentence statement saying that its "security team is investigating the veracity of these threats with relevant law enforcement officials."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The threat was posted in Arabic under a headline "Foundation for the conquest of Jerusalem for the Islamic State," and "Twitter a target for the caliphate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Islamic State is fighting to create an extremist state -- or caliphate -- across a wide area of Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Jack, how will you protect your helpless employees when their necks are on the line and they become an official target for soldiers of the succession and their supporters among you?" the online post states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"What will be your response to their families and sons, and their plight in this failed war?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The post includes a matted photo of Dorsey with a target on his face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"From the beginning of this failed war, we've said that this is not your war," the ISIL post says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"But you did not understand and kept closing our accounts on Twitter, but we always come back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Twitter rules note that "you may not publish or post direct, specific threats of violence against others."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Also banned: "any unlawful purposes or in furtherance of illegal activities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Twitter and other social media sites have been cracking down on Islamic State accounts since June, when a major offensive resulted in large swaths land falling into the militant group's hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the group's social media savvy and resilience have kept their campaign alive on the Internet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Dorsey, 38, a web developer and entrepreneur, founded Twitter in 2006 with Noah Glass, Biz Stone and Evan Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Twitter has more than 500 million users, more than half of which remain active on the site.</td></tr>
