<h3>Apple, Google, Microsoft cop tax audit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Technology giants Apple, Google and Microsoft have told the federal inquiry into corporate tax avoidance that they are being audited by the tax office for alleged tax avoidance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple Australia managing director Tony King, Google Australia and New Zealand managing director Maile Carnegie and Microsoft's global tax chief Bill Sample were under fire over the low level of taxes the companies have been paying in Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The companies are also accused of channelling profits through low-tax or no tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Bermuda, and using marketing hubs in Singapore, where the official corporate tax rate is 17 per cent, but where they can lower their tax rates further through a range of incentives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple Australia managing director Tony King.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google reported its 2013 Australian tax as $7 million, paid on a $46 million profit - a rate of 15 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But this does not include an estimated $2 billion worth of income it earns through advertising locally on its lucrative search engine business - which are booked overseas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ms Carnegie conceded that revenue gained by Google for advertising services from Australia customers was booked in Singapore, although she would not disclose the value of this revenue as it would be in "breach of US financial disclosure rules".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ms Carnegie said since Google was headquartered in the United States and created most of its intellectual property there, that's where it paid the bulk of tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This, she said, was no different to Australian miners such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, which derive profits from China, but still count most of their revenue in Australia, and thereby pay more tax here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Microsoft global vice president for tax Bill Sample.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If you look at someone like a Rio Tinto, about 35 per cent of its customer base is in China, and they're paying less than 1 per cent of tax in China, because their Australian headquarters are bearing the risk," Ms Carnegie said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greens leader Senator Christine Milne asked the executives about the "double Irish sandwich with Dutch associations" - a nickname given to one of the complex tax minimisation schemes multinationals such as Apple are accused of using.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple's Tony King said he did not know what this was, despite it being globally recognised as Apple's main tax structure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr King said Apple Australia bought products such iPads and iPhones from overseas operations, and resold them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It then gets taxed on its local profit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We purchase our products on an arms length basis from affiliates and declare all of our income in accordance with Australian tax law," Mr King said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Microsoft's Bill Sample said there had been $2 billion in software product and service revenue booked in Singapore but only $100 million in Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Labor Senator Sam Dastyari said: "Any inquiry that results in people learning about a Double Irish Dutch sandwich and a Bermuda black hole is a good day for public policy. It's important to shine a light on the dark corners of corporate tax minimisation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Dastyari will write to Senate Clerk Rosemary Laing to see what power the Senate has to appeal against the public interest immunity claim at the heart of an ATO decision to keep secret the names of mining companies accused of dodging tax by shifting profits offshore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The use of hubs, while not illegal, has come under question by governments seeking to raise revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In 2012-13 Australian companies sent more than $100 billion to related parties in the low-tax nation of Singapore and another $15.6 billion to "hubs" in Switzerland, according to the ATO's own submission to the inquiry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said Australia was losing billions of dollars a year because the tax system is not up to the task of capturing revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The inquiry will over the coming days also grill big four accounting firm and resource company executives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Fairfax Media has also learned that that Uber and Airbnb will face questioning by the Senate Economics References Committee in coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Tax Office is looking to claw back more than $1.1 billion in revenue from multinationals by 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan has vowed the ATO will beat that 2013 budget target, and said that it expects to get much of it by the end of the year through audits of the "most aggressive" technology companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The inquiry continues in Canberra on Thursday.</td></tr>
