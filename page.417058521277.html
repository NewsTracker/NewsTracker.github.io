<h3>CANNES WATCH: France's 'My King' is a roller-coaster romance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Relationship drama "My King" pairs Emmanuelle Bercot and Vincent Cassel, two of the busiest people in Cannes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bercot stars in the French film as one half of a couple enduring a roller-coaster 10-year romance, and also directed the festival's opener, juvenile-delinquent drama "Standing Tall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cassel plays her charming, possessive partner - the king of the partly ironic title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He's also in two other royalty-themed Cannes entries, appearing as a lustful fairy-tale king in Matteo Garrone's "Tale of Tales" and lending his voice to animated "The Little Prince."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Directed by French actress-filmmaker Maiwenn, "My King" is a female take on relationships, in a year when the place of women in the film industry is being hotly debated at Cannes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"My King" is one of only two female-directed films among 19 competing for the Palme d'Or, and "Standing Tall" - which is not in competition - is the first film by a woman to open the festival since the 1980s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"People keep referring to women here, women there," Maiwenn said, a touch wearily, at a press conference for "My King" Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Maybe in a couple of years' time they will start saying there aren't enough Moroccans ... We aren't chosen because of our gender or this or that. We're chosen because of our film."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"My King" is unmistakably the work of a female director, offering an intense and sometimes humorous take on male-female relationships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both characters torment one another, but the story unfolds from the point of view of Bercot's Tony, as she falls in and out of love with Cassel's duplicitous Georgio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"In the script I felt the character was really despicable and I made tremendous efforts ... to save him," said 48-year-old Cassel, who played the mercurial choreographer in Darren Aronofsky's ballet drama "Black Swan."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I really fought for the status of men. People say it's difficult being a woman, and I've no doubt about that, but it's also difficult being a man - especially in a love story."</td></tr>
