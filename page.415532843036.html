<h3>Japanese import impresses Waratahs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The South African-born Japanese international arrived at the Super Rugby champions this week, having impressed coach Michael Cheika, who studied video of the 22-year-old backline utility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"He can move," Cheika said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"He's got some ball skills too; I've seen him move the ball around a bit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"For us, he'll play out in the wider parts, probably centre or wing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That's where Matsushima has featured in his six Tests for Japan after debuting for the Cherry Blossoms last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Matsushima is a product of Toin Gakven High School in Tokyo and has spent time with the Sharks' development team in Durban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Waratahs signed him last month in an arrangement between the Australian and Japanese rugby unions in which he's considered a special addition to the Super Rugby titleholders' 35-man squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We look after him playing over here and he gets the experience playing in the professional environment," Cheika said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The Japanese have been trying to push that so that they improve the quality of their players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I wouldn't call him an exchange student. He's here. As far as I'm concerned, he's another contracted player."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cheika said that as with any other player, form would dictate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If he's got the form, he'll get a run."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Matsushima said he was excited by his opportunity to play in Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I am very looking forward to have a new experience and learn a lot of things," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I want to grow more, not only a better player but also as a person."</td></tr>
