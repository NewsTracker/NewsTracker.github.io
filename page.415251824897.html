<h3>Our House Of Cards Economy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Could the fictional jobs program work in real life?" asks Hunter Schwarz in the Washington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>To deal with high unemployment rate and his low approval ratings, the fictional President Underwood aims to create 10 million jobs with an AmWorks program having the "size and scope of the New Deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"If you want a job," says Underwood, "you get a job."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In Underwood's scheme, the government generates jobs in the short run by giving up to $45,000 to private sector firms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Longer term, Underwood talks of investing in infrastructure, maintenance and repair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the short-run, he funds a pilot program by raiding FEMA funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Longer term, he talks of covering costs by cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cost tab?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>$500 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Schwarz asked Stan Veuger, a resident scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, for his assessment as to how AmWorks would play out in reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Basically, not very well," was the unsurprising answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Socialist countries typically have something like Overall, it's a terrible idea."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Analysts on the right, like the American Enterprise Institute, are however markedly less skeptical about corporate welfare, in which unprecedented sums of government money are shoveled through the central bank into the economy, providing essentially free money to the corporate sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With this largess, profits have risen, the stock market is at record levels, unemployment is declining and corporate bonuses have continued to soar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>From this perspective, President Underwood's political misstep was to shovel the government money to individuals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If he had found a way to shift $500 billion to the corporate sector, he would have been praised by the talking heads as an economic genius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Yet is our current prosperity real?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Or is it as fictional as President Underwood's AmWorks?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Prosperity: real or fiction?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>For some time, Deloitte's Center for the Edge has been pointing out that the rates of return on assets and on invested capital of US firms have been on a steady decline for decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Last year, in Harvard Business Review, William Lazonick pointed out that share buybacks have amounted to some $3.4 trillion from 2004 to 2013, often bought at the top of the market, thus using financial engineering to bolster share prices and assure executive bonuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Even the business-friendly journal, The Economist, called this the equivalent of "corporate cocaine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"One of the puzzles of our economy today is that on the one hand, we have record low real interest rates, that are expected to be record low for 30 years if you look at the index bond market. And on the other hand, we have record high profits. And you tend to think record high profits would mean record high returns to capital, would also mean really high interest rates. And what we actually have is really low real interest rates. The way to think about that is there's a lot of rents in what we're calling profits that don't really represent a return to investment, but represent a rent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Thus corporate profits have soared as a share of national income, but there is no sign of a rise in the rate of return on investment or in the productivity statistics, which have been dismal since 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Rising profits thus reflect the rents of monopoly power rather than real returns to capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some like Mike Konczal in the Next New Deal are preoccupied with distributional issues, such as: who should be getting those rents?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Is it fair that they flow to the top 1%?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Shouldn't they be shared around more?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The more serious question is: how do we generate a growing real economy in which profits reflect real growth of goods and services, rather than zero-sum financial engineering?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Why aren't governments and corporations focused on growing the real economy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A plausible hypothesis is that the big, steeply-hierarchical bureaucracies that we have inherited from the 20th Century are faced with a fundamental shift in power in the marketplace from seller to buyer, and are unable to cope the continuous innovation needed to prosper in this new context.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>As a result, they resort to the artificial means of financial engineering and share buybacks, aided by the "government cocaine" of seemingly endless supplies of cheap money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The result is a House of Cards economy in which apparent prosperity masks hidden risks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Ultra-low global interest rates drive market participants into riskier assets, while low interest rates encourage using greater leverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The underlying problem?</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>We don't know where all the leverage is buried and will only find out after the fact, as we should have learned from the increasingly severe financial crashes over the last few decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The current low level of corporate defaults, supported by free government money and financial engineering, can't last forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>So far, "investor have only reaped the benefits of owning riskier assets but have not suffered from the 'risky' part of that theme," notes investment manager, Vitaliy Katsenelson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"But suffering will come, unless you believe that QE injections have miraculously modified the laws of financial gravity so that by taking more risk you simply get ever-higher returns."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>We already see signs of massive and unprecedented volatility-a 50% decline in oil price in a few months in the absence of any external crisis, and a 16% shift in a major currency-the Swiss Franc-in one day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The problem is that we don't know where increased volatility will strike next or when, or what type of extreme leverage will aggravate the shock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Katsenelson also offers an interesting analogy: "The arguments in favor of GMO crops are that they increase yields, decrease the need for pesticides and mitigate soil erosion. The argument against them is simple but more ambiguous: We don't know the long-term consequences of growing and eating GMOs. It's the same thing with QE, which is even less organic to the economy than GMOs are to the soil and the human body. We know the positives, but it is the hidden consequences, the things we don't know, that scare me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>In the meantime, Fed chairs, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, are acclaimed as saviors of the American Economy and models for the rest of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Just this week, the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, announced that it will begin its big new stimulus program this coming Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The central bank had announced in January that it would embark on a program of large-scale asset purchases intended to fix the collapse in consumer prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>In thus emulating the Federal Reserve, Draghi predicted improvements in the economy and in the eurozone's inflation picture as a result of the effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Who can resist this financial cocaine?</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Back in 1720, Isaac Newton, arguably the smartest human being who ever lived, intellectually knew that the South Sea Company was a fraud and a bubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Yet even he couldn't resist investing-and losing-most of his life savings in it, when he saw how much money others seemed to be making.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>It is hard not to follow the crowd when so much money is involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>At present, most of our prosperity is built on rents and artificial highs rather than growth of the real economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Yet there is also is a part of the economy-the Creative Economy-that is based on real growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Still largely unknown to macro-economists, the Creative Economy comprises firms like Apple [AAPL] dedicated to delighting customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Making money is the result, not the goal of their activities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The focus of the Creative Economy is on continuous innovation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>It sets out to provide what the new force in the marketplace-the customer-is demanding: "better, cheaper, faster, smaller, more convenient and more personalized."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The dynamic of the Creative Economy dynamic is enablement, rather than control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>It aspires to liberate the full talents and capacities of those doing the work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>It is oriented to understanding and creating the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>It believes in banking, not necessarily banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>It believes in accommodation, not necessarily hotels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>It believes in transport, not necessarily cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>It believes in health, not necessarily hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>It believes in education, not necessarily schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The Creative Economy involves a Copernican revolution in management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>It is still relatively small but it is growing rapidly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>It is also spreading like a virus and has established footholds in most of the big old organizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>This economy-the Creative Economy-is thriving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>The Creative Economy is the antithesis of the House of Cards economy of zero-sum games, financial engineering and government cocaine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>It produces real goods and services for real people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>The dynamic of firms in the Creative Economy is in some ways very new but it also reflects something very old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>These firms reflect what John Houseman used to tell us so often about Smith Barney: "They make money the old-fashioned way. They earn it."</td></tr>
