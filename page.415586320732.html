<h3>Lufthansa pilot strike grounds most long-haul flights</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A pilots' strike grounded more than half of Deutsche Lufthansa AG's lucrative long-haul flights on Thursday, the latest action to pile pressure on management in a protracted row over early retirement benefits and cost cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lufthansa is trying to cut costs to levels nearer those of its rivals as it is squeezed by budget carriers Ryanair and easyJet on European routes and by airlines such as Turkish and Emirates on long-haul flights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Including Thursday's strike, pilots have walked out 13 times since last April, affecting almost one million passengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Other Lufthansa employees are starting to worry the row could damage the business for good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We fortunately have very loyal customers, but if this continues in the long run and we aren't able to offer the reliability we need, then it could become a problem for our customers," Peter Gerber, chief executive of Lufthansa Cargo, told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lufthansa Cargo said all its freight-only flights would operate on Thursday, but the strike would affect the freight it carries in the holds of long-haul passenger planes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Lufthansa cancelled 84 of its planned 153 long-haul flights for Thursday, affecting 18,000 passengers, a spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) is extending the strike to short- and medium-haul Lufthansa flights on Friday and said it would strike again on Saturday on long-haul and cargo flights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lufthansa said it was cancelling 700 short- and medium-haul flights on Friday, equivalent to about half its scheduled flights, while another 90 were being cancelled because of a strike by Italian air traffic controllers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It said it would still be able to fly about a third of its scheduled flights on Saturday, but said the additional strike represented a new escalation of the conflict, which it feared was having a long-term impact on the reputation of the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Pilot strikes cost Lufthansa more than 200-million ($213-million) in lost operating profit last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Experience so far shows that bookings drop sharply after a strike is announced, stay low for a couple of days and then recover fairly quickly, a Lufthansa spokeswoman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However, continuing strikes could force corporate travel managers to push travellers onto other airlines, especially as Lufthansa mainly serves transfer passengers who could just as easily fly via hubs in London, Amsterdam or the Gulf, independent aviation consultant John Strickland said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The only winners are Lufthansa's competitors, whether long-haul or short-haul," Strickland said, adding that it was still crucial for Lufthansa management to push through structural changes to keep up with rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The row involves early retirement benefits that VC wants to keep but which Lufthansa wants to change for new starters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The pilots also want Lufthansa to enter joint mediation on other outstanding issues, such as pay and bringing costs down on flights to tourist destinations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Lufthansa has rejected the demand.</td></tr>

<h3>EU agrees Russia sanctions to stay until Ukraine peace terms met</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The compromise reached at an EU summit in Brussels maintains EU unity on sanctions against Moscow over its role in the Ukraine conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Strains have been growing within the 28-country bloc over sanctions which some member governments have only supported reluctantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>EU governments were divided on whether to act now to renew economic sanctions on Russia which expire in July or to wait several months before taking a decision to see if the Ukraine ceasefire holds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>EU leaders backed a compromise hammered out by European Council President Donald Tusk together with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, two of the architects of the Ukraine peace plan reached in Minsk last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Leaders "agreed that the duration of economic sanctions will be clearly linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements, bearing in mind that this is only foreseen by the end of 2015", Tusk told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>EU leaders were also "ready to take further decisions if necessary", he said, in a clear threat of additional sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A formal, legal decision on whether to extend sanctions on Russia's financial, defense and energy sectors that expire in July will only be taken at the next EU summit in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the link to the Ukraine peace agreement effectively extends economic sanctions until the end of the year because the Minsk accord sets a year-end deadline for Kiev to recover full control over its border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The agreement only referred to economic sanctions, however, leaving open the possibility that some of the visa bans and asset freezes the EU has imposed on scores of Russian and Ukrainian citizens and organizations could be lifted before year-end if the situation in eastern Ukraine improved, EU diplomats said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"If things deteriorate on the ground, we will strengthen sanctions. If, on the other hand, the situation remains stable and improves, then we might envisage a re-examination of the scale of the sanctions package and possibly ease it," a French diplomatic source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some EU ministers have said an offensive by pro-Russian separatists against the port of Mariupol would trigger stepped-up sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Merkel made clear when speaking to Germany's lower house of parliament earlier on Thursday that economic sanctions on Russia would not be eased until the terms of Minsk had been fully met.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We cannot and will not lift the sanctions that expire in July or September until the demands of the Minsk agreement have been fulfilled. That would be wrong," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Minsk agreement, which set out a series of steps to defuse the Ukraine crisis including a ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons, came under renewed strain on Wednesday, with Ukraine and Russia clashing publicly over the next steps and further Ukrainian military casualties from rebel attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Merkel also spoke by phone to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday and they agreed there would be no easing of sanctions until Russia had fulfilled all of its commitments under Minsk, the White House said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said EU leaders should discuss renewing existing sanctions or scaling up sanctions if Russia failed to implement the Minsk deal, but he rejected any talk of easing the measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"If Putin splits the unity ... among the leaders of the EU member countries, this will be the biggest success story of President Putin and this will be a disaster for the free world," he told reporters in Brussels after a pre-summit meeting with Tusk on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yatseniuk also said the EU had not yet responded to Ukraine's request for U.N. peacekeepers or an EU police mission to monitor the ceasefire.</td></tr>
