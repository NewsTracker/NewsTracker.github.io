<h3>Premarket: Global stocks sour as Apple results leave bitter aftertaste</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Disappointment over U.S. corporate earnings, most notably at Apple Inc., the world's largest company, pushed stocks lower on Wednesday and investors towards the shelter of bonds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Retrenchment and caution dominated trading in other assets, with the dollar slipping a little further from its recent highs and commodities such as gold and oil resuming their downturn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Stocks will look to corporate earnings on both sides of the Atlantic for direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Meanwhile, the Greek parliament will vote on reforms it must undertake for talks on a multibillion-euro bailout to start this week, which will help determine broader sentiment in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The FTSEuroFirst 300 index of leading European shares fell 0.5 per cent in early trade to 1,588 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Germany's DAX fell 0.6 per cent to 11,534 points and France's CAC 40 was down 0.5 per cent at 5,079 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Britain's FTSE 100, which is more exposed to the mining and energy sectors, was down 0.7 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>British investors are also awaiting the latest Bank of England policy minutes, which may show a more hawkish tilt towards raising rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Despite a beat at the earnings level and a surge in revenue from China, the market latched onto disappointing overall iPhone shipments relative to street expectations," said Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank in London, of Apple's results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Combined with a near-4 per cent fall for Microsoft in extended trading after a similarly disappointing report, (U.S.) futures have fallen this morning."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>S&P futures showed Wall Street expected to open down around 0.5 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>European bourses were also weighed down by a 4 per cent fall in chip maker Arm Holdings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Although ARM posted a 32 per cent rise in second-quarter profit, the results from Apple, a major customer, hit hard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 1 per cent, its biggest decline in two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Japan's Nikkei stock index ended down 1.2 per cent, snapping its six-day rising streak and pulling away from Tuesday's nearly four-week closing high as the Apple news reverberated on related tech shares.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Following its tumble to a five-year low on Monday, investors remained wary of gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It reversed Tuesday's rebound to trade down 0.7 per cent on the day to $1,090.95 per ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We believe gold should range trade around current levels, but do not dismiss the possibility of further price falls, given the lack of safe-haven interest," Barclays commodities analysts wrote in a note to clients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Crude oil futures were still under pressure too, as investors worried about ample supply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>U.S. crude was down 1.5 per cent at $50.10 and Brent shed more than 1 per cent to $56.43.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In currencies, the euro edged up to $1.0950, continuing its rebound from Monday's three-month low of $1.0808, and the dollar index slipped 0.1 per cent to 97.218.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>On Tuesday, it rose as high as 98.151, a level not seen since late April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sterling was the biggest mover among major currencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It was up 0.4 per cent against the dollar at $1.5615, supported by expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates around the turn of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>On Greece, Standard & Poor's upgraded its sovereign credit rating on Tuesday by two notches and revised its outlook to stable from negative, citing euro zone countries' initial agreement to start negotiations with Athens on a third bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>European bond markets awaited the Greek parliament vote, sticking to narrow ranges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Benchmark 10-year Bund yields fell a basis point to 0.77 per cent, and Italian yields were steady at 1.96 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"The newsflow since last week's deal does not fill us with great hope about the design of the pending deal, which is one reason we retain a fairly pessimistic view about what has been solved in Greece," said Michael Michaelides at RBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries slipped a basis point to 2.33 per cent.</td></tr>
