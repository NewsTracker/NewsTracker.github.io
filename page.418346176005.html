<h3>Microsoft's Xbox Music Renamed Groove Music in Upcoming Windows 10</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This article, Microsoft s Xbox Music renamed Groove in upcoming Windows 10, originally appeared on CNET.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Microsoft has changed the name of Xbox Music to Groove.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Microsoft is rebranding its current Xbox Music service to Groove, and will start rolling it out with Windows 10 PCs as of July 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Those currently subscribing to Xbox Music Pass don t need to do anything; they ll automatically get Groove Music Pass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The renamed Microsoft Groove service costs $9.99 a month, or $99 per year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Windows 10, the upcoming version of Microsoft s operating system, is set to start rolling out at the end of this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Xbox Video, as Windows Insiders already know, also is being renamed to Movies & TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Windows Insiders will be able to test Groove once Microsoft releases the next Windows 10 preview build for PCs, according to a Microsoft blog post Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After Twitter user @TimN_FL discovered a new page that referred to Xbox Music Pass as Groove Music Pass earlier Monday, a number of us Microsoft watchers were wondering what was in the works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After all, there s already a Windows Phone/Windows 8 music app in the Store called Groove: Smart Music Player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That app, developed by Canadian startup Zikera, is also available for iOS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Groove player app from Zikera that exists today is powered by Last.fm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>(Last.fm is a part of CBS, which also owns CNET.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But it seems the new Microsoft Groove and Groove Music Pass have nothing to do with Zikera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When I asked if Microsoft had bought Zikera, a Microsoft spokesperson said "we have nothing more to share at this time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There s nothing on Zikera s site that indicates they have been bought by Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This story originally posted as "Microsoft rebrands Xbox Music as Groove" on ZDNet.</td></tr>
