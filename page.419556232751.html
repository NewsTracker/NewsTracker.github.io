<h3>Islamic State claims 30 killed for sodomy, UN meeting told</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Islamic State extremist group has claimed responsibility for executing at least 30 people for sodomy, the head of an international gay rights organization said Monday at the first-ever U.N. Security Council meeting spotlighting violence and discrimination against lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It's about time, 70 years after the creation of the U.N., that the fate of LGBT persons who fear for their lives around the world is taking center stage," said U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power, who organized the meeting with Chile's U.N. envoy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"This represents a small but historic step."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Diplomats said two of the 15 council members, Chad and Angola, did not attend the informal, closed meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jessica Stern, executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, told the council that courts established by the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria claim to have punished sodomy with stoning, firing squads and beheadings and by pushing men from tall buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fear of the extremist group, which controls about a third of Syria and Iraq, has fueled violence by others against LGBT individuals, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Subhi Nahas, a gay refugee from the Syrian city of Idlib, told the council that President Bashar Assad's government "launched a campaign accusing all dissidents of being homosexuals" when that country's uprising started in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Soon afterward, gay hangouts were raided and many people were arrested and tortured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Some were never heard from again," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front took Idlib in 2012, he said, its militants announced "they would cleanse the town of those involved in sodomy," and arrests and executions of accused homosexuals followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last year, when the Islamic State took the city, the violence worsened, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"At the executions, hundreds of townspeople, including children, cheered jubilantly as at a wedding," Nahas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If a victim did not die after being hurled off a building, the townspeople stoned him to death. This was to be my fate too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He was able to escape to Lebanon, then to Turkey, where he was threatened by a former school friend from Idlib who had joined the Islamic State group, and finally to the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Stern stressed that persecution of LGBT people in Iraq and Syria began long before the emergence of the Islamic State group, also known as Daesh, and "murder is only the most extreme form of violence" that also includes rape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She called for specific strategies to combat LGBT attacks, including U.N. action to relocate those most in need and bringing the gay community into broader human rights and humanitarian initiatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Monday's meeting follows the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June legalizing same-sex marriages in all 50 states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Chile's President Michelle Bachelet declared in April 2013 that she would seek to legalize same-sex marriage, though that hasn't happened yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>According to a report in June by the U.N. human rights chief, at least 76 countries retain laws used to criminalize and harass people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A gay Iraqi man who called into Monday's meeting from somewhere in the Middle East using the pseudonym Adnan said he fears for his life because "in my society, being gay means death, and when ISIS kills gays most people are happy because they think we are evil."</td></tr>
