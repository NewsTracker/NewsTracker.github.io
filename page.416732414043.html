<tr><td>6</td><td>Saved: Mr Tamang was rescued on Saturday with only minor injuries to his ankle and hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pitching in: An RAF C-17 aircraft delivers aid in Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A team of humanitarian experts chartered the aircraft to get to the group, who were marooned at a remote mountainside religious retreat in Bihi, near Lho, for a week after the devastating earthquake struck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The team of emergency staff from the Department for International Development (Dfid) flew the group to Kathmandu where they boarded planes on Saturday to start their journey back to the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Police also pulled three women alive from under rubble on Sunday in Sindhupalchowk, one of the worst-hit districts, although it was not immediately known how long they had been trapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The rescues were rare good news for the devastated country after officials on Saturday had ruled out finding more survivors buried in the ruins and the focus shifted to trying to deliver aid to thousands in remote Himalayan areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The death toll from the disaster has hit 7,250, according to the Emergency Operations Centre, with more than 14,000 injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More than 100 were also killed in India and China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said the death toll was likely to jump once relief teams reached mountain villages flattened in the worst quake to hit the nation in more than 80 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'There are still villages where we know that all houses have been destroyed, but have not yet been able to reach,' Mahat said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'The aftershocks have not receded and we expect the final casualty numbers to climb much higher,' the minister said, as he appealed for hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign donations to help rebuild the country.</td></tr>

<tr><td>21</td><td>Nepal has been forced to close its only international airport to large jets flying in relief supplies and aid workers because the only runway cannot handle the strain of the stream of aircraft flying in to help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Medium and small-size jets will still be allowed to land, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Birendra Shrestha, the manager of Tribhuwan International Airport, located on the outskirts of Kathmandu, said bigger planes were banned because the runway was deteriorating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Doing what they can: Nepalese soldiers clearing debris at the Swayambhunath temple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It was built to handle only medium-size jets and not the large military and cargo planes that have been flying to the airport since the magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The past week has seen a steady procession of big jets trying to fly in goods and relief workers, as well as a swarm of journalists, but the small airport has parking slots for only nine jets and only one runway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>There have been reports of cracks on the runway and other problems at the only international airport in Nepal and the only one capable of handling jetliners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'This runway is the only lifeline for Kathmandu,' said Mr Shrestha.</td></tr>

<tr><td>34</td><td>Bereft: Lila Khanal gazes over the rubble of her collapsed home in Pokharidanda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The country's poor infrastructure and a weak national government beset by in-fighting among coalition partners have compounded the difficulties of mounting a vast emergency relief operation in the world's highest mountains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>'One of the big challenges of working in Nepal, and we knew that this would happen should a major earthquake happen here, is the nature of the terrain,' the UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told AFP in Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>'There are a lot of villages which are on the top of hills, they're quite small villages but there are no real roads that go up to those villages, and we know that there are quite a few areas like that because the epicentre is in a mountainous region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Indian Air Force pilot Avik Abhijit S Bali described how he had to abandon efforts to rescue survivors from a remote village in Gorkha, one of the worst-hit districts, because he could not land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>'We tried for 20 minutes but there was no possibility of landing in a village that was on a slope and covered in debris from collapsed houses,' he told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>With authorities saying up to 90 percent of homes in the two worst-affected districts have been destroyed, the United Nations says providing shelter is the priority.</td></tr>

<tr><td>52</td><td>Britain has added a further 5.3 million to aid relief efforts to help people affected by the Nepal earthquake disaster.</td></tr>

<tr><td>57</td><td>And many more families are continuing their agonising wait to hear if their loved ones survived the natural disaster, which triggered avalanches that swept away Everest Base Camp.</td></tr>
