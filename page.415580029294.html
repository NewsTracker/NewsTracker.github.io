<h3>Social Q?s: Advice on Being Left Out of Family Photos</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Eighteen years later, we are still together, but have decided not to marry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His aunt apologized to me ages ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But my boyfriend's brother still insists that I not be included in family photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>My boyfriend stood up to him, and this brother is no longer welcome in our home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But when we attend family functions, he acts friendly to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>How should I handle this?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Here's a theory: This may have nothing to do with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>You didn't mention any spat or ill will with the brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Perhaps he acts all friendly toward you because he likes you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And this Kodak drama is really just one brother tweaking another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Trust me: I have two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And none of our partners have ever signified as strongly as the ancient rivalries of 30-year-old footraces or urinating-the-farthest contests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>(No offense, in-laws.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Encourage the brothers to spend time together, explicitly not trying to resolve this petty feud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Perhaps a woodsy hike or movie date would restore some fraternal feeling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As for your behavior, you can never go wrong taking the high road, even though this guy has hurt your feelings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Acting politely would only heighten his jerk-itude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Though in (partial) defense of your aunt's rule, the best family portrait I have includes a guy I dated for six minutes in 1992.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Airbrush, anyone?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the past year, I attended the funerals of two friends' parents and made generous contributions to suggested charities in their honor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Now, my beloved father has died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>(We provided envelopes for my father's charity at his wake.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The first friend attended the wake and funeral and sent a lovely card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The second sent a nice note, period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I would like to salvage these friendships, but I believe that they are dissing my dad by not making a contribution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Should I discuss this with them?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>I am sorry for your loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Please do nothing, for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>I am pretty sure that when the dust settles, and you begin feeling a little better, you will see that these friends did no damage that requires salvaging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>They both sent their condolences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>You may have some free-floating anger now (mixed in with your grief), and this "suggested donation" business may be convenient flypaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Wait a few months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>If you are still upset, ask yourself: Is playing tit-for-tat over charitable contributions the best way to honor my father?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>I bet he would want you to let this go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>And gifts are always optional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Our son is getting married.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>We invited his fiancee's parents (who were visiting from out of town) to our home for dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>We had a good time, and they reciprocated by inviting us out to eat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>At the table, the fiancee's father announced that they like to share meals at restaurants, and without asking what we would like, he ordered the entire meal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>(If it matters, we didn't care for anything he ordered. Still, we went along with him.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>My wife got over this quickly, but I find it offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>How can we politely put our foot down next time?</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Question for you: Did you ask your in-laws-to-be whether they liked coq au vin before you served them dinner at your place?</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>(I know, who doesn't? But still.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>And I assume they picked up the tab at the reciprocation meal, which gives them a wee bit more leeway as hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>They probably got carried away, ordering family style to symbolize the union of two great clans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>(Or they may be a gigantic control freaks.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Next time, simply ask: "What are you thinking of ordering? I'd love to try the cassoulet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Hard to imagine anyone taking offense at that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>And if sharing food is not your thing (some people hate it), just say, "How about communal starters, then ordering our own main courses?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Finding a compromise here seems the least you can do for you son - particularly since he may never order food for himself again.</td></tr>
