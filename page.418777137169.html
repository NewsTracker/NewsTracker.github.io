<h3>WWE cuts ties with Hulk Hogan amid report that he used slurs (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>STAMFORD, Conn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. has severed ties with Hulk Hogan amid a report that one of the biggest stars in professional wrestling history used racial slurs in a conversation caught on a sex tape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The company deleted most references to Hogan on its website and issued a statement Friday saying it had terminated its contract with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Friday, a joint report from RadarOnline.com and The National Enquirer said that Hogan had used racial slurs in a conversation caught on a sex video that is the subject of an invasion of privacy lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a statement, the 61-year-old Hogan apologized for using ''offensive language'' in a conversation eight years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It was unacceptable for me to have used that offensive language; there is no excuse for it; and I apologize for having done it,'' Hogan said, calling his departure from a WWE a resignation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hogan, perhaps the biggest star in WWE's five-decade history, was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years in its signature event, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He won six WWE championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005 by Sylvester Stallone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hogan is currently seeking $100 million from the website Gawker for posting part of the sex tape of him with Heather Cole, the ex-wife of Hogan's one-time friend and radio show host Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gawker, which removed the video from its website under a court order, said it had the right to publish the edited video because Hogan talked in detail about his sex life before the video's release, which made the story newsworthy.</td></tr>
