<h3>A Rihanna Documentary Is Coming</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In addition to her many upcoming and ongoing projects, global pop singer Rihanna is going to be the focus of a documentary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While it has no title or tentative release date just yet, the film does have the beginnings of staff in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Peter Berg will direct the feature, which is supposedly going to be "much more a character study than a music film", so expect to get to know the singer better than we already do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The movie is so far being described as an "unfiltered look into Rihanna's life and how she's ascended to become a global icon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This is not the first time that Berg and the Barbadian pop star have worked together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The director, who has previously sat behind the camera for Friday Night Lights (both the movie and the subsequent television show) and Hancock, gave her a break into movies by casting her in his epic Battleship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While the military/action thriller might not have been critically lauded, it was a success at the box office, and it seems Berg's interest in Rihanna was piqued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>(from left to right) Paul McCartney, Rihanna, and Kanye West in a still from their music video for "FourFiveSeconds".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Berg is also familiar with the music world, having directed videos for Maroon 5 ("Maps", "One More Night"), Christina Aguilera ("Keeps Gettin Better"), and Enrique Iglesias ("Addicted").</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After a short time out of the spotlight (or, at least as "out of the spotlight" as one of the biggest figures in the world can be), Rihanna has been busying herself lately with plenty of new material.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The singer recently nabbed another big hit with her Kanye West and Paul McCartney-assisted "FourFiveSeconds", which the trio performed at the Grammys last month (where Rihanna also took home her fourth trophy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The single is expected to be on a forthcoming album, the details of which are murky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There have been plenty of rumors and false reports over the past year or so, but the singer hasn't given much away in terms of a title, sound, or date of release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The pop star also just released a new track called "Towards The Sun", which is the lead single from the soundtrack of the upcoming Dreamworks film Home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rihanna recorded the song specifically for the album, which she is also curating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As if that wasn't enough, she also has a voice role in the film, which also stars Jennifer Lopez, Steve Martin, and Jim Parsons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Is Rihanna Dropping A Surprise Album?</td></tr>

<h3>CIA chief: Social media hampers fight against 'terror'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>John Brennan, the CIA director, said such communications only added to the difficulty of dealing with diffuse threats and attacks across the world from groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"New technologies can help groups like ISIL coordinate operations, attract new recruits, disseminate propaganda, and inspire sympathisers across the globe to act in their name," Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The overall threat of terrorism is greatly amplified by today's interconnected world, where an incident in one corner of the globe can instantly spark a reaction thousands of miles away; and where a lone extremist can go online and learn how to carry out an attack without ever leaving home," Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Brennan cited a recent spate of attacks, including shootings at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, at a cafe in Copenhagen, Denmark and a Pakistani school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"These attacks underscore a disturbing trend that we have been monitoring for some time: The emergence of a terrorist threat that is increasingly decentralised, difficult to track, and difficult to thwart."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The security concerns over the last year underscore an increasingly volatile world with more outbreaks of instability since the fall of the Soviet Union, Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And while agencies such as the CIA have worked to boost their capability of fighting cyber-based threats, those bent on committing "acts of terror" have used technologies to romanticise their ideology, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"A lot of it is inconsistent with realities of Iraq and Syria. But this phenomenon now has generated a lot of appeal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Brennan said governments would have to work with private industry and other partners to identify and track down extremists, pointing to the ongoing conflict in Syria and Iraq and the challenge of foreign fighters engaging in the conflict there as a top priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The director also said that intelligence was not the only solution to global instability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"What we need to be able to do is to help policy makers understand some of the forces that are at play and how certain developments and actions may affect that calculus. And that's what I think is important for the CIA," said Brennan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The CIA has stepped up its expertise in cyberspace, creating new units within the agency called "mission centres", intended to concentrate focus on specific challenges or geographic areas, such as weapons proliferation or Africa.</td></tr>
