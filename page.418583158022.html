<h3>Google self-driving car involved in first injury accident</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Google Inc. revealed Thursday that one of its self-driving car prototypes was involved in an injury accident for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the collision, a Lexus SUV that the tech giant outfitted with sensors and cameras was rear-ended in Google's home city of Mountain View, where more than 20 prototypes have been self-maneuvering through traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The three people on board complained of minor whiplash, were checked out at a hospital and cleared to go back to work following the July 1 collision, Google said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The driver of the other car also complained of neck and back pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In California, a person must be behind the wheel of a self-driving car being tested on public roads to take control in an emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google typically sends another employee in the front passenger seat to record details of the ride on a laptop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In this case, there was also a back seat passenger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google has invested heavily as a pioneer of self-driving cars, technology it believes will be safer and more efficient than human drivers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This was the 14th accident in six years and about 1.9 million miles of testing, according to the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google has said that its cars have not caused any of the collisions - though in 2011 an employee who took a car to run an errand rear-ended another vehicle while the Google car was out of self-driving mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 11 of the 14, Google said its car was rear-ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a blog posted Thursday, the head of Google's self-driving car program, Chris Urmson, wrote that his SUVs "are being hit surprisingly often" by distracted drivers, perhaps people looking at their phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The clear theme is human error and inattention," Urmson wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We'll take all this as a signal that we're starting to compare favorably with human drivers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In a telephone interview, Urmson said his team was exploring whether its cars could do something to alert distracted drivers before a collision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Honking would be one possibility, but Urmson said he worried that could start to annoy residents of Mountain View.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Google's SUV was going about 15 mph in self-driving mode behind two other cars as the group approached an intersection with a green light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The first car slowed to a stop so as not to block the intersection - traffic on the far side was not moving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Google car and the other car in front of it also stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Within about a second, a fourth vehicle rear-ended the Google car at about 17 mph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>On-board sensors showed the other car did not brake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The driver of that car reported "minor neck and back pain."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The SUV's rear bumper was slightly damaged, while the vehicle that struck it lost its front bumper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mountain View police responded, but did not file an accident report.</td></tr>
