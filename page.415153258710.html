<h3>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Says Speech Not Meant to Disrespect President Obama</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Israeli Prime Minister defended his address to Congress, which is slated to take place Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was appreciative of President Barack Obama in his Monday address to the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, D.C.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Speaking before a crowd of 16,000 at the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee Policy Conference on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted his upcoming speech to Congress was not meant as a sign of disrespect to President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I deeply appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel - security cooperation, intelligence sharing, support at the U.N. and much more," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I am deeply grateful for this support and so should you be."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The purpose of my address to Congress tomorrow is to speak up about a potential deal with Iran that could threaten the survival of Israel," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I have a moral obligation to speak up in the face of these dangers while there's still time to avert them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The nuclear negotiations with Iran have been a prominent topic at AIPAC's Policy Conference, which includes a day of lobbying on Capitol Hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The bipartisan, pro-Israel organization has advocated for passing additional sanctions on Iran to increase pressure on that regime to reach a deal, but the Obama administration has asked Congress to hold off until diplomacy plays out between six major powers and Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The negotiations aim to relieve sanctions on Iran in exchange for assurance the country's nuclear program is solely peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>U.S. legislators have put an additional sanctions bill on hold until March 24; the current negotiations are slated to conclude at the end of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Netanyahu vehemently opposes the negotiations out of concern that the U.S. will agree to a deal that endangers Israel's security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Israel and United States agree that Iran should not have nuclear weapons," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But we disagree on the best way to prevent Iran from developing those weapons. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The public clash on the issue has made the already strained relationship between Netanyahu and Obama even more so, even though the two leaders continue to cooperate on security issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Israeli prime minister accepted an invitation to address Congress from House Speaker John Boehner, who did not inform the Obama administration beforehand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The administration called it a "breach of protocol" and said Obama will not meet with Netanyahu while in Washington so as not to to influence upcoming Israeli elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Obama has spoken at AIPAC in the past, as have Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Biden and Kerry are both traveling internationally Monday, and the administration is being represented at AIPAC this year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power and National Security Advisor Susan Rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Power addressed the AIPAC plenary Monday morning before Netanyahu and emphasized the U.S. commitment to Israel's security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She rejected the politicization of the prime minister's visit, saying the U.S. commitment to Israel "transcends politics."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We believe diplomacy is the preferred route to secure our shared aim, but if diplomacy should fail we know the stakes of a nuclear-armed Iran as well as everyone here. We will not let it happen," Power said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"There will never be a sunset on America's commitment to Israel's security. Never."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Power said the U.S. is ready to work with Israel and the Palestinians towards a two-state solution, but "progress toward that solution will require brave leadership and tough decisions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"And as successive U.S. administrations have made clear for decades, Israeli settlement activity damages the prospects for peace," Power said to a smattering of applause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Also on Monday, Kerry underscored U.S. dedication to Israel in remarks in front of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, and criticized the body for unfairly targeting Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"No one in this room can deny that there is an unbalanced focus on one democratic country," Kerry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"It must be said the [council's] obsession with Israel actually risks undermining the credibility of the entire organization."</td></tr>
