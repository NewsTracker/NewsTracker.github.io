<h3>U.S. announces massive attack plans for 25,000 Iraqi soldier to retake Mosul from ISIS in spring offensive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The official from U.S. Central Command said the operation would involve 12 Iraqi brigades, five of which would be trained for the mission by the coalition in the coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Those five would make up the core fighting force that would launch the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But they would be supplemented by three smaller brigades serving as reserve forces, along with three Peshmerga brigades who would contain the Islamic State fighters from the north and west.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>News of the offensive comes amid reports the terror group is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds, Mosul and Raqqa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Islamic State fighters parade in a commandeered Iraqi security forces armoured vehicle through the Iraqi city of Mosul in June last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sources say morale has plummeted in recent weeks following the loss of the Syrian city of Kobane and disgust over the horrific murder of the Jordanian pilot who was burned to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In its de facto capital of Raqqa, activists say disillusioned jihadi militants are trying to steal identity papers from locals in a bid to flee to Turkey or areas controlled by the Nusra Front, an Al Qaeda affiliate fighting ISIS in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The group, Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, says ISIS is becoming increasingly concerned about the problem and is making announcements in mosques re-iterating that its fighters are banned from such thefts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile, one activist in Mosul said residents were desperately finding ways to circumvent a written guarantee imposed by ISIS that allows the jihadists to take property from people who flee the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some were being helped by corrupt ISIS officials who are agreeing to turn a blind eye for a $500 bribe, it was reported by The Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Giving further details of the planned assault on Mosul, the U.S. official said there also would also be a fighting force, largely made up of former Mosul police and tribal forces, who would have to be ready to go back into the city once the army units clear out the Islamic State fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Included in the force would be a brigade of Iraqi counterterrorism forces who have been trained by U.S. special operations forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The brigades include roughly 2,000 troops each.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The official was not authorized to discuss the operation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Military leaders don't often disclose as many details of an operation before it takes place, but in some cases it can have an impact on the enemy, trigger a reaction or even prompt some militants to flee before the assault begins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The operation itself comes as no surprise to the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Iraqi leaders have for months made it publicly clear that they were planning an operation to retake Mosul and that they were eager to get started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In addition, U.S. officials had already acknowledged that they were beginning preparations for the Mosul mission, including using airstrikes to shut down supply lines that the insurgents were using to get equipment or people in and out of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Asked why U.S. Central Command was telegraphing the timeframe and details of the operation to the enemy, the official said it was important to highlight the effort the Iraqi security forces are putting into the mission and how committed they are to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The official said the U.S. will provide military support for the operation, including training, air support, intelligence and surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The official said there has been no decision made yet on whether to send in some U.S. ground troops to help call in airstrikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That decision would be made by senior defense and military leaders and President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Islamic State militants overtook Mosul last June, as the group marched across large sections of Iraq and Syria, sending Iraqi forces fleeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>At this point, officials estimate there are between 1,000 to 2,000 Islamic State insurgents in the city of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Military leaders have been talking about retaking the city for some time, but they have said they won't launch the operation until the Iraqi troops are ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The official said they wanted to retake Mosul in the spring, before the summer heat and the holiday month of Ramadan kick in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"But by the same token, if they're not ready, if the conditions are not set, if all the equipment they need is not physically there and they (aren't) trained to a degree in which they will be successful, we have not closed the door on continuing to slide that to the right," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Under the plan, the approximately 3,200 Iraqi forces that have completed the training already or are going through it now would replace the five main brigades wherever thay are now, and those five units would then go through several weeks of final training before the Mosul operation begins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The official also revealed for the first time that Qatar has agreed to host a training site for coalition forces to train moderate Syrian rebels who would return to Syria to fight the Islamic State forces there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Other sites are in Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The training facility in Jordan is ready to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The technical agreement on the Turkey training site was signed Thursday, and it is nearly ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The facility in Saudi Arabia will be ready to open in one to three months, and the site in Qatar will be finished in six to nine months, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The U.S. and other coalition nations will train the Syrian fighters so they can return to their own country and battle the Islamic State group.</td></tr>

<h3>'Two and a Half Men' wraps after 12 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Charlie Harper lives - at least, he lived until the final moments of Thursday's series finale of "Two and a Half Men."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A baby grand piano fell on the millionaire playboy as he made a momentous return to his Malibu beach house, clearly finishing him off four years after his presumed death with the firing of Charlie Sheen, who had played him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was a kookie, sly twist, followed a moment later by a second piano falling on the show's co-creator, Chuck Lorre, who had only a split-second to gloat that he had pulled a fast one on viewers: Charlie Sheen hadn't, as widely expected, made a conciliatory return to the show after all as it ended its 12-season run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Portrayed by a body double, Charlie Harper was only seen from behind as he approached his front door and met his startling, presumably final, demise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sheen, of course, had been dumped from the CBS sitcom four years ago after scandalous behavior and stormy feuding with Lorre, and from the first moments of the finale the viewer was set up not only to expect the return of Charlie Harper, but of Sheen in the role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Quickly evidence mounted that Harper hadn't really fallen to his death in front of a Paris subway train, as had been reported at the time by Rose, the crazy one-night-stand-turned-wife who back then had followed him to Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Instead, Rose (Melanie Lynskey) had been holding him hostage for four years in a dungeon underneath her house back in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>All this she explained midway in the episode as she stopped in at his old homestead, the posh beach-front digs still occupied by his brother Alan (series veteran Jon Cryer) and Walden, the subsequent owner of the house (played by Ashton Kutcher, who joined the show after Sheen left).</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rose told them that Charlie had escaped from the pit a few days earlier and was on the loose, threatening revenge on Alan and Walden - and maybe on Rose herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Now that you're all caught up, I'll say my good-byes," Rose said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I'm not gonna stick around to find out what he's gonna do to me just because I loved him too much."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Indeed, Alan and Walden realized there had never been a death certificate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Walden: "How do you know he's really dead?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Alan: "Of course he's dead! I have his ashes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Walden: "How do you know that they're HIS ashes?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Alan: "What do you want me to do? Test them for herpes?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The pair reported the possible danger Charlie posed to an LAPD lieutenant played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of the show's cameo performances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Bewildered, he recapped the case (and in the process, the series' wacky 12 seasons) and advised them to wrap "this whole thing up. This whole thing has been going on waaaay too long."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Yeah," said Alan, in one of the episode's self-referential wisecracks, "a lot of people have been saying that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Two and a Half Men" premiered in September 2003, tailored for Sheen and his real-life image as a bad boy and freewheeling bachelor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The character he played, who was flush from writing jingles, shared his home with his uptight brother and Alan's young son (Angus T. Jones, who, now grown and departed from the show, made a guest appearance on the finale).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Sheen was fired from the show in March 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That spring, he roared back with a bizarre nationwide tour of live appearances billed as "My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat is Not An Option."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Among his "truths" were ugly rants directed at Lorre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Lorre got his comeuppance Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>On his production "vanity card," Lorre explained that Sheen had been offered the role of Crushed Charlie in the episode, but said that Sheen had other ideas for how it should go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>There would be no rapprochement with Charlie Sheen, no mercy for Charlie Harper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Then, ever the comedian, Lorre invoked one of Sheen's notorious slogans, "Winning," from his director's chair as he savored the scene, then dropped a piano on himself.</td></tr>
