<h3>Apple trying to entice musiciansÂ including Taylor Swift into deals for Beats streaming</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The company is in talks with Florence and the Machine to give Apple limited streaming rights to a track from their album set to be released in June, Bloomberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple has also approached Taylor Swift and others about partnerships, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Beats-ing the competition?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Beats Music will be re-launched in coming months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There will be a $9.99-a-month subscription for individuals and a family plan for $14.99, according to sources, Bloomberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple bought audio equipment and music streaming company Beats for about $3 billion in May 2014, hoping to catch up in fast-growing music streaming industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Music streaming service Tidal, launched last month by rapper Jay Z, is also trying to convince artists to sign exclusive deals for their content, to fend off competition from services such as Spotify and Google Inc's YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Competitors: The Jay Z-backed Beats competitor Tidal has a slew of big name co-owners including Madonna, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tidal isn't new, but it's getting a reboot from rapper Jay-Z, who bought the Scandinavian company behind it, Aspiro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Madonna, Rihanna and Beyonce are among the co-owners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That's notable because many artists complain about how little payment they get from other music services, such as Spotify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As owners, artists could insist on better deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The membership-based service will provide music and video content that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline.</td></tr>
