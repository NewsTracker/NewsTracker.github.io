<tr><td>3</td><td>Ending years of reluctance, Turkey late last month carried out airstrikes against IS targets in Syria and agreed to allow U.S. warplanes to use Incirlik Air Base for operations, taking a more front-line role in the U.S.-led coalition's fight against the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>U.S. officials said the first armed drone missions out of Turkey began last weekend and that the military was planning to add manned aircraft flights from the country.</td></tr>
