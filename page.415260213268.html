<h3>Ferguson police practices created 'oppressive and abusive' situation, Obama says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday condemned the Missouri city of Ferguson for "oppressive and abusive" actions against African-Americans that were laid bare in a U.S. Justice Department report accusing police and court officials of a range of illegal actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The president's comments came as U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Friday dismantling the police department was a possibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We are prepared to use all the power that we have... to ensure that the situation changes there," Holder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"That means everything from working with them to coming up with an entirely new structure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said three city workers who demonstrated "egregious racial bias" are no longer employed by the city, and said Ferguson officials are pursuing other reforms to try to reach a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Justice Department said it found that the mostly white police force routinely targeted African-Americans for arrests and ticketing in part to raise revenue for the city through fines and fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It also found officers followed a pattern of using excessive force and illegally arresting people without cause, deploying attack dogs and tasers on unarmed people "unreasonably."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"What we saw was that the Ferguson Police Department in conjunction with the municipality saw traffic stops, arrests, tickets as a revenue generator, as opposed to serving the community, and that it systematically was biased against African Americas in that city who were stopped, harassed, mistreated, abused, called names, fined," Obama said in comments made at a town hall-style meeting in South Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The federal investigation started after a white Ferguson police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager on Aug. 9, triggering nationwide protests and illuminating long-held complaints in Ferguson and elsewhere about police treatment of minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Justice Department said it did not find grounds to prosecute police officer Darren Wilson for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown, but it did find racially disparate practices rampant through the police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Obama on Friday said he fully supported the decision not to charge Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"That was the decision that was made, and I have complete confidence and stand fully behind the decision that was made by the Justice Department on that issue," Obama said at the town-hall meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The city and the Justice Department are attempting to negotiate reforms to address the problems found, and Knowles said the city has hired a consultant to work with the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Knowles said city leaders plan to meet with Justice Department officials in about two weeks to review reform strategies, and try to agree on a settlement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles says the city is looking at the report and working with the Justice Department but wouldn't comment on whether the local police chief would be asked to resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Relations between the city and the Justice Department have been tense over the last several months amid the federal probe, and city officials have bristled at some of the report's allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"There are a lot of things in that report that are very troubling and need to be addressed, but there are also things that are an overreach," Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Knowles would not comment on whether Police Chief Tom Jackson would be asked to step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Several community and civil rights leaders, as well as some lawmakers, have called for Jackson's ouster for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We're looking at where the breakdown was and then we'll make changes accordingly," Knowles said.</td></tr>

<h3>U.S. believed security for Seoul ambassador adequate before attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert (3rd L) leaves after he was slashed in the face by an unidentified assailant at a public forum in central Seoul March 5, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government experts believed security for the U.S. ambassador to South Korea was adequate before he was slashed by a knife-wielding attacker, in spite of current high tensions with North Korea, the State Department said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>U.S. ambassador Mark Lippert needed 80 stitches after his face was cut at a forum discussing Korean unification in Seoul on Thursday by an assailant who had made multiple visits to North Korea between 1999 and 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>South Korean police said they were investigating possible links between the attack and the visits, but State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the motive was still not known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are still getting all the facts about how people were screened to get in to this event, how they were on the list, how they were allowed in," she told a regular news briefing, adding that the embassy was coordinating with the Korean-led probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The attack was carried out by 55-year-old Korean nationalist Kim Ki-jong, now under arrest, who said he was protesting against annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises that began this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Harf said security for U.S. ambassadors around the world was based on assessments by experts from the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and said Lippert had been assigned a single South Korean National Police bodyguard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Since the attack, Harf said, Lippert's security had been boosted with several other South Korean police officers and the United States would "see if anything else needs to be done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She said she had not heard of plans to boost diplomatic security elsewhere in the world following the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Their professional judgment was that it wasn't."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Other South Korean police were present at the time of the attack but not at the request of the U.S. embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lippert was in stable condition and recovering from the attack but was expected to remain in the hospital until Tuesday or Wednesday, she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>North Korean state media has said the attack against Lippert was "deserved punishment" for the military drills, calling the assault "the knife of justice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Harf called the North Korean statement "outrageously callous but unfortunately consistent with the nature of this regime and its rhetoric."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Lippert arrived in Seoul last year and has a reputation for an informal, approachable style.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He would usually walk the short distance from his residence to the embassy and could also be seen walking his basset hound, Grigsby, in central Seoul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two retired former U.S. ambassadors said security was largely a judgment call for individual ambassadors and there was a constant trade off between security and the desire to be seen as open and accessible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The only way you are going to stay perfectly safe is if you stay holed up in the embassy and I would argue that the ambassador's not doing his job in those circumstances," said Steven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine now at the Brookings Institution think tank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>James Jones, who had an eight-person personal security detail in Mexico, said South Korea should not be a major security issue "other than what overflows from North Korea."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Your security details will always want to have more security than you think is necessary, than you think is politically wise, so you make the decision on whether you want more or less and they have to abide by that decision," he said.</td></tr>
