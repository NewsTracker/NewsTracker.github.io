<h3>Cyclone Pam leaves trail of destruction in Pacific's Vanuatu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A shipping container lies in the street in the center of Port Vila, Vanuatu's capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Damage caused by Cyclone Pam on the outskirts of the Vanuatu capital of Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tropical Cyclone Pam reportedly claimed at least five lives 14 March in the South Pacific and the toll was feared to climb from one of the strongest such storms on record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The cyclone ripped its way through an area dotted with islands, bringing powerful winds, heavy rain and rough seas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>People checking a severely damaged building on Vanuatu island, South Pacific region, 14 March 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Residents of cyclone-ravaged Vanuatu hunkered in emergency shelters for a second straight night Saturday after venturing out to find their homes damaged or blown away by the powerful storm, aid workers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Packing winds of 168 miles per hour, Cyclone Pam tore through the tiny South Pacific archipelago early Saturday, leaving a trail of destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Power remained out across Vanuatu later Saturday and people on many of the outer islands had no access to running water or outside communications, said Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer in the capital, Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Morrison said communications have been so problematic that her aid group hasn't yet been able to account for many of its own staff of 76 on the islands and authorities have been unable to assess the extent of the damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I can say that for anybody who wasn't in a secure shelter last night, it would have been a very, very tough time for them," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 spread over 65 islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>About 47,000 people live in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Morrison said authorities did a good job Friday moving thousands of people in Port Vila into 23 evacuation centers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With the winds and rain easing Saturday, many people stepped out only to find that their homes were missing a roof or had disappeared altogether, and were forced to return to the shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Teetering trees and downed power lines in Port Vila have made many areas hazardous, Morrison said, adding that she had heard reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's still really quite dangerous outside. Most people are still hunkering down," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, estimated that 54,000 children were among those affected by the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the scope of the damage caused by the cyclone wasn't yet clear, but he feared it could be widespread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We hope the loss of life will be minimal," Ban said during the World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The U.N. said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who was attending the conference, told participants, "I do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Morrison said the first priority was to ensure people had adequate food, drinking water and shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Beyond that, she said, there would need to be a long and concerted rebuilding effort in the months ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She said the winds peaked between about midnight Friday and 1 a.m. Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A westward change of course put populated areas directly in the path of Cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were unconfirmed reports of 44 deaths in Vanuatu's northeastern islands after Pam moved off its expected track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>New Zealand on Saturday pledged 1 million New Zealand dollars ($734,000) to help with relief efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Australia was preparing to send a crisis response team if needed, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"There are destructive winds, rain, flooding, landslides, sea surges and very rough seas and the storm is exceedingly destructive there," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We are still assessing the situation, but we stand ready to assist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The small island nation, located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, has repeatedly warned that it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change, with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing residents to resettle on higher ground and reducing yields on traditional crops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Scientists say it's impossible to attribute single weather events like Cyclone Pam to climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The cyclone also caused damage to other Pacific islands, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Authorities in New Zealand are now bracing for Cyclone Pam, which is forecast to pass north of the country on Sunday and Monday.</td></tr>

<h3>Kurds Say ISIS Used Chemical Weapons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The allegation by the Kurdistan Region Security Council, stemming from a Jan. 23 suicide truck bomb attack in northern Iraq, did not immediately draw a reaction from ISIS group, which holds a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, Iraqi officials and Kurds fighting in Syria have made similar allegations about the militants using the low-grade chemical weapons against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a statement, the council said the alleged chemical attack took place on a road between Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, and the Syrian border, as peshmerga forces fought to seize a vital supply line used by the Sunni militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It said its fighters later found "around 20 gas canisters" that had been loaded onto the truck involved in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Kurds say samples of clothing and soil from the site were analyzed by an unnamed lab in an unnamed coalition partner nation, which found chlorine traces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The fact ISIS relies on such tactics demonstrates it has lost the initiative and is resorting to desperate measures," the Kurdish government said in the statement, using an alternate acronym for the Sunni militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chlorine, an industrial chemical, was first introduced as a chemical weapon at Ypres in World War I with disastrous effects as gas masks were not widely available at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While chlorine has many industrial and public uses, as a weapon it chokes victims to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the Syrian civil war, a chlorine gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus in 2013 killed hundreds and nearly drove the U.S. to launch airstrikes against the government of embattled President Bashar Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The U.S. and Western allies accused Assad's government of being responsible for that attack, while Damascus blamed rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There have been several allegations that ISIS has used chlorine as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In October, Iraqi officials claimed ISIS militants may have used chlorine-filled cylinders during clashes in late September in the towns of Balad and Duluiya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Their disclosures came as reports from the Syrian border town of Kobani indicated that the extremist group added chlorine to an arsenal that already includes heavy weapons and tanks looted from captured military bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Insurgents have used chlorine gas in Iraq before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In May 2007, suicide bombers driving chlorine tankers struck three cities in Anbar province, killing two police officers and forcing about 350 Iraqi civilians and six U.S. troops to seek treatment for gas exposure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Those bombers belonged to al-Qaida in Iraq, which later became ISIS.</td></tr>
