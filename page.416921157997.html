<h3>Dior's cruise show draws celebrity crowd before Cannes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>French actress Marion Cotillard arrives at the Dior Resort 2015 catwalk show presented in Cannes, southeastern France, Monday, May 11, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With stunning views of the French Riviera and the spatial brilliance of the famed "Bubble House" as a backdrop, Dior faced some serious competition for the best visuals at its cruise show Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the fashion house did not disappoint, presenting a collection both abstract and traditional, filled with bold colors and asymmetrical designs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The cruise show was back on the Riviera after showing in Brooklyn last spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This year, Dior selected the Palais Bulles owned by fashion designer Pierre Cardin, nestled in the mountain tops outside of Cannes, which plays host to the film festival that kicks off Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The celluloid set was there in all its glory: Oscar winner Marion Cotillard, Zoe Kravitz, Theresa Palmer and Dakota Fanning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cardin joined them at the intimate show, staged in one of the outdoor spaces of his mansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dior creative director Raf Simons said the collection was inspired by the Riviera, and the looks of some of the dresses reflected the brilliant blues and greens of the ocean, made metallic in a multicolored skirt and a matching dress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There were fashions for a casual beach day and more formal events, and some that required a very specific occasion - a green tweed knitted hot pants body suit, for example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fanning was among those impressed by show.</td></tr>
