<h3>Chile's Calbuco volcano erupts for the third time forcing thousands to flee</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chilean volcano Calbuco has erupted for the third time in eight days, sending a new cloud of ash and gas high into the sky and forcing thousands of people to flee the area once again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Calbuco spewed more than 200 million tonnes of ash last week, coating nearby towns, wrecking parts of the salmon industry and forcing the cancellation of flights as far as Buenos Aires 870 miles away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The volcano has been quiet this week, but geological officials had warned it was still unstable and could erupt again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Calbuco, one of the most active along a chain of around 2,000 in Chile, is in the scenic Los Lagos region, a popular tourist destination around 1,000km (620 miles) south of the capital, Santiago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new eruption began at 1.09pm (4.09pm GMT) yesterday, the government's geology service Sernageomin said, although officials it was less powerful than those of last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>TV pictures showed a thick, grey plume spreading quickly into the sky on Thursday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was heading south-east over the Andes into Argentina, said government meteorologist Arnaldo Zuniga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>LATAM Airlines' Chilean arm LAN, which cancelled some flights last week as a precaution because of the ash cloud, said flights in Chile and Argentina were unaffected so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A 20km (12-mile) exclusion zone has remained in place around the volcano since the first sudden eruption on April 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But some residents have been making short visits to their homes to begin clearing away thick layers of ash and debris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>About 1,500 more people had been evacuated yesterday, interior minister Mahmud Aleuy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said there were indications that the eruption was not as powerful as those of last week, when ash and gas reached 17 km (10.5 miles) into the atmosphere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'This emission is notably weaker than the previous ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>We are talking about a column of ash no higher than four kilometers,' said Aleuy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Officials said, however, that heavy rain or snow on Friday could lead to complications such as lahares - destructive flows of debris that can wipe out anything in their path.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'This emission should begin to weaken in the coming hours... but we are in an eruptive process, on red alert, and the situation can change at any time,' said Sernageomin head Rodrigo Alvarez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The second spectacular blast from the Calbuco volcano covered nearby towns and villages in a thick layer of ash last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Local authorities evacuated 4,000 people from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt - 620 miles south of the capital Santiago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Even Professor David Pyle who has studied over a century of eruptions across Chile's 1000-mile stretch of volcanoes ranks this one among the strongest - and claims its ash could cross the Pacific to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He ranked the second explosion 'a three or four' on the Volcanic Explosivity Index which means it could unleash an astonishing ten billion cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Professor Pyle told MailOnline: 'Based on a 15km-high plume and an eruption of around an hour and a half, that's quite strong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This particular volcano has erupted a number of times over the last hundred years.</td></tr>
