<h3>Clinton cautious about Obama's Pacific trade deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As she kicks off her presidential campaign, Clinton is under pressure from the liberal wing of her party to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal involving the United States, Japan, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico and seven other Pacific rim nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Labor unions and other progressive organizations say the pact would hurt U.S. jobs and encourage abuse of workers and the environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a statement Friday, Clinton's Democratic presidential campaign said she believes that any new trade measure should "protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The agreement should also "strengthen our national security," the campaign said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton thinks the U.S. should reject any final deal that does not satisfy those criteria, the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade's sake," according to the campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>More specifically, the statement said, she will be "watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation, improve labor rights, protect the environment and health, promote transparency and open new opportunities for our small businesses to export overseas."</td></tr>
