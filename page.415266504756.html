<h3>Wine from Civil War-era shipwreck uncorked in South Carolina</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The verdict: A heady sulphur bouquet with distinct notes of saltwater and gasoline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The wine was uncorked at a Charleston Wine + Food event titled "From Deep Below: A Wine Event 150 Years in the Making."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>About 50 people bought tickets to watch as a panel of wine experts decanted and tasted it on Friday evening, organizers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I've had shipwreck wines before," master sommelier Paul Roberts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They can be great."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To peals of audience laughter, the panel said the cloudy yellow-gray liquid smelled and tasted like a mixture of crab water, gasoline, salt water and vinegar, with hints of citrus and alcohol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It could have been a Spanish fortified wine, a spirit, or medicine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But after 151 years at the bottom of the ocean, it's now mostly saltwater, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Wine chemist Pierre Louis Teissedre of the University of Bordeaux who had analyzed samples drawn through the cork earlier said the "nose" of the wine was a room-clearing mix of camphor, stagnant water, hydrocarbons, turpentine and sulphur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Analysis showed it was 37% alcohol, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The wine was one of five sealed bottles recovered by marine archaeologists from the Mary-Celestia, an iron-hulled sidewheel steamship that sank under mysterious circumstances during the U.S. Civil War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The boat was leaving Bermuda with supplies for the Confederate states when it struck a reef and sank in six minutes, said Philippe Rouja, a cultural anthropologist and custodian of historic shipwrecks for the Bermudan government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rouja and his brother, Jean-Pierre Rouja, were diving on the shipwreck in 2011 after winter storms swept over the site when they found a bottle of wine inside a secret boatswain's locker in the bow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Subsequent dives turned up the additional bottles, as well as sealed bottles of perfume, women's shoes, hairbrushes and pearl shell buttons, Philippe Rouja said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This year marks the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War, which was fought from 1861 to 1865 and began in Charleston Harbor with the Battle of Fort Sumter.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran adjust to harsh new life inside 'Iron' prison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Even inside the walls of Nusakambangan's "Iron" prison, Bali nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been able to find opportunities for humour as they await their executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The pair were last week transferred amid unprecedented security to the harsh surroundings on the penal island, where frugal food rations and limited visits from family have replaced the support networks they built up at Bali's Kerobokan prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Executions delayed: Myuran Sukumaran arrives at Cilacap airport en route to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are already forming a close bond with another death row inmate in their isolation block, a Nigerian who Indonesian authorities continue to misname even though they arrested him 17 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to a report in the Jawa Pos newspaper by a journalist who infiltrated the party of officials and lawyers who visited the men on Friday, the identity mix-up has caused much mirth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When the visitors arrived, Chan remarked and laughed - "I spoke to Raheem. It was not his real name - it was a fake passport!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Raheem Agbaje Salami"s real name is Jamiu Owolabi Abashin. He was arrested in 1998 for smuggling 5.3 kilograms of heroin into Surabaya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Andrew Chan arrives at Cilacap airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran talk constantly with Abashin through the cell walls in their four prison block in Besi, or "Iron" prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Besi is one of seven penitentiaries in the prison complex on Nusakambangan, the island in Central Java where the Indonesian government plans to execute Chan, Sukumaran, Abashin and seven others simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jamiu Owolabi Abashin, aka Raheem Agbaje Salami, has struck up a friendship with the Bali nine duo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>According to the Jawa Pos, "Andrew and Myuran looked very friendly, there was light talk with everyone, and once in a while they laughed very freely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"They didn't look panicked or upset," wrote the reporter who, as is common in the Indonesian language press, only used initials for a byline, in this case "Idr".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Andrew looked cheerful. Myuran was a little more quiet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The account fits with that of other visitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The duo's fortitude is remarkable given the shadow of death that hangs over them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Their new home, Besi or "Iron" prison, is an austere place, where the standard meal on offer is rice with vegetables.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meat is served only on special occasions, or when guests arrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tempeh or tofu is the main protein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It's a world away from Bali's Kerobokan prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>By their own deeds, and the free-wheeling approach to corrections management at Kerobokan, the Bali nine duo created a haven of sorts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The classes and courses they oversaw gave them purpose, and a little money has always gone a long way to making life more comfortable - a less crowded cell and takeaway food, just for starters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>While others reputedly use cash to buy drugs and even procure prostitutes and outside visits, the two Australians have ploughed their money into their courses and helping out prisoners with medical procedures and legal appeals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It was no paradise, but there are gardens, a tennis court and a generally tolerant approach from guards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Schapelle Corby, the other famous drug smuggler who lived in Kerobokan, always rejected any notion that she be allowed to serve out her term in an Australian prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It is all very different at Besi prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Father Charlie Burrows, a local priest and a regular visitor, said conditions at Besi were "OK, but it's an old prison" built in 1929.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Even so, says Father Burrows, "they wouldn't be in a situation where they could mix with other prisoners."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Father Burrows says the budget for food for prisoners is 14,000 rupiah a day ($1.50) This is generally rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The main source of protein is tempeh or tofu and then there might be some green vegetable called Kangkung (water spinach).</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Father Burrows says people on death row are probably given special treatment, such as a flask of tea, biscuits or extra bottles of water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The jailers are quite humane because they have to live with the prisoners. They live and let live and avoid hassle and bad feelings. They would be concerned to give them the best treatment possible in light of the executions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Pasir Putih, the new supermax prison on Nusakambangan, is more comfortable, but holds a coterie of jihadists and the notorious extremist cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, the spiritual leader of the Bali bombers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Unlike Kerobokan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>where visitors can come twice a day, five days a week, the Australians can receive family and friends on Monday and Wednesday, and only during the morning.</td></tr>
