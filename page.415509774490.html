<h3>Mets pitcher Zack Wheeler has torn elbow ligament (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- - Mets pitcher Zack Wheeler has a torn elbow ligament, a blow to a team hoping to compete for the playoffs following Matt Harvey's return from Tommy John surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said Wheeler has a complete tear, all but guaranteeing the 24-year-old right-hander will need elbow-ligament replacement surgery and miss the 2015 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''I feel terrible for Zack, especially the way he finished last year,'' Mets manager Terry Collins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''For this to happen at this time, I'm sure he's really down about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wheeler had MRIs of his elbow in late September, January and Saturday, and Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said the first two did not show any ligament damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The team did not restrict Wheeler's throwing program during the first three weeks of spring training, even though there was concern about his elbow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Until Monday, Mets officials said Wheeler's latest MRI was only precautionary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Wheeler said he would have been able to throw through the pain had it been the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''He says he could have pitched, so I'm not that concerned about it,'' Collins said Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Alderson said the team was warned by doctors in January that Wheeler's elbow ''was a concern and was going to have to be managed'' this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''It wasn't clear that the ligament was involved at that time, but we understood that we were going to have to manage his medical condition over the course of this season,'' Alderson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''When he complained of the elbow pain, it wasn't a surprise to us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Wheeler had his latest MRI on Saturday in Port St. Lucie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The scan was reviewed Monday at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and he was with a torn ulnar collateral ligament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Mets said Wheeler planned to travel Monday or Tuesday to New York to confirm the diagnosis and discuss with team medical director Dr. David Altchek on how to proceed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The announcement came one day after the Mets said Josh Edgin, the team's most-established left-handed reliever, will have elbow-ligament replacement surgery this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The only other left-handed relievers in camp are Sean Gilmartin and three pitchers with minor league contracts - Scott Rice, Dario Alvarez and Jack Leathersich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Wheeler's injury could end New York's thoughts of trading Dillon Gee for a shortstop or offensive help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Harvey now heads a rotation that includes NL Rookie of the Year Jacob deGrom, Jonathon Niese, Bartolo Colon and Gee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Collins said Gee would replace Wheeler in the rotation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Gee was the Mets' opening-day starter last year but primarily had been working out of the bullpen this spring training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Gee is scheduled to start Thursday against Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''That's why we have him,'' Collins said of Gee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''He'll be the guy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Wheeler was selected by San Francisco with the sixth overall pick in the 2009 amateur draft and was traded to New York two years later in the deal that brought outfielder Carlos Beltran to the Giants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He has gone 18-16 since his big league debut in June 2013, exciting the Mets with a fastball that averaged 96 mph last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Wheeler made his only spring training appearance March 9, allowing six runs, two hits, two walks and two hit batters in 1 2-3 innings against Miami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He pitched a perfect first, then got in trouble in the second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Wheeler is among the prized young pitchers the Mets have been trying to rebuild around as they try to end a streak of six straight losing seasons, one shy of the team record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Harvey, who threw four scoreless innings against the Red Sox on Monday, said the team still can contend for a playoff spot without Wheeler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''Whoever they put in, we're going to be fine,'' Harvey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''Obviously it's a big blow to us to have Zack down, but Dillon Gee has won a lot of games and can step in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Harvey, 25, established himself as a big league All-Star before being diagnosed with a torn elbow ligament in August 2013, an injury that caused him to miss last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Syndergaard, a 22-year-old right-hander, could make his big league debut this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He was drafted by Toronto with the 38th overall pick and acquired after the 2012 season in the trade that sent NL Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey to the Blue Jays.</td></tr>

<h3>American Ebola patient takes a turn for the worse</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>-- An American health care worker who contracted Ebola while volunteering in a Sierra Leone treatment unit has been downgraded to critical condition at the National Institutes of Health, doctors said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The agency said in a statement that the patient's status was changed from serious condition to critical condition, meaning the person's condition has apparently worsened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The patient is being treated at the National Institutes of Health's hospital near Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The patient was flown in isolation from Sierra Leone on a chartered plane last week and arrived early Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The patient's name, age and gender have not been released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The person is a clinician working with Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The group has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The NIH hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, is equipped with special isolation facilities for treating patients with highly contagious diseases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's same hospital where nurse Nina Pham was successfully treated after she contracted Ebola from a patient in Dallas last October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman said that besides the patient at NIH, there are 11 other Partners in Health workers being brought to the United States for monitoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha is monitoring four people who may have been exposed in Sierra Leone, and the hospital says one of them was moved into a biocontainment unit after developing symptoms on Sunday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"At this point, this person has not tested positive for the Ebola virus," Phil Smith, M.D., medical director of the Biocontainment Unit at Nebraska Medicine, said in a press statement Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"However, because of a change in symptoms, we decided the most prudent course of action was to bring the individual to the Biocontainment Unit, where we can better monitor symptoms and safely perform testing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Smith emphasized that the general public was not at risk because the person was separated from other patients and staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In addition to the people being monitored in Nebraska, three others arrived in the Washington area on Sunday to be near the NIH campus in Bethesda, and four were going to Atlanta to be near Emory University Hospital; one arrived Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Those workers have not tested positive for Ebola but may have been exposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>CDC workers in Sierra Leone are involved in investigating the illness of the first patient, including looking for other people the person was in contact with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It's possible other people will be transported to the United States for monitoring, said the spokesman, Tom Skinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The World Health Organization reports more than 10,000 people have died of Ebola since the outbreak began in West Africa last year.</td></tr>
