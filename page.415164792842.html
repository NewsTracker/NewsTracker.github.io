<h3>Boris Nemtsov's Ukrainian girlfriend who witnessed murder allowed to return to Kiev</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ganna Duritska, who was walking with Nemtsov when he died, arrived safely at Kiev airport, her lawyer Vadim Prokhorov - who was accompanying her - told reporters, adding that she needed to rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nemtsov was shot dead shortly before midnight Friday while walking across a bridge just a short distance from the Kremlin together with 23-year-old Duritska.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Putin, whose rule has seen the steady suppression of independent media, non-Kremlin controlled political parties and opposition-minded business figures, called the murder a "contract killing" and said it was a provocation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Soon after the killing, Putin promised an all-out effort to catch the perpetrators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Monday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pledged that the "heinous crime" would be "fully investigated".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A reward of three million rubles ($48,000) was offered for information on Nemtsov's death, a substantial amount in Moscow, where the average monthly salary is 60,000 rubles ($960).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Duritska said earlier Monday she had given all the information she could to investigators but that they were preventing her from leaving Russia, citing concerns for her security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"For three days they have escorted me in police cars to the Investigative Committee," Duritska told the independent Dozhd television channel, referring to the agency in charge of the probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ganna's mother Inna Duritska, who lives in Kiev, told AFP she feared that her daughter's de facto house arrest meant investigators might be preparing to make her a pawn in the deepening Russia-Ukraine crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After she was allowed to leave Russia, Yevhen Perebyinis, a Ukraine foreign ministry spokesman, wrote on his Twitter feed that "Ukrainian diplomats in Moscow provided all the necessary assistance for her return home".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Moscow and Kiev have been foes since the ouster last year of Kremlin-backed president Viktor Yanukovych and Russia's seizure of the Ukrainian Crimea province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ukraine's current pro-Western government has also been battling a pro-Russian insurgency in the east since April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nemtsov was said by friends to have been working on a report containing what he said was proof of secret Russian military involvement in the bloody uprising by pro-Moscow militias in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He had also spoken of his fear of being killed in Russia, where a string of other prominent opposition figures have been murdered since Putin came to power 15 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But there was no imminent sign of danger on Friday when he was fatally shot in the back, Duritska - who was uninjured in the apparently well-prepared shooting - said earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Speaking via a fuzzy Skype connection from a Moscow apartment, Duritska said she did not see where the assassin came from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But she did notice a light-coloured car quickly drive off, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Shocked opposition figures in Russia and Western leaders called for a full and transparent probe into the murder of Nemtsov, who served as Boris Yeltsin's first deputy prime minister in the 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On Sunday, tens of thousands of people joined a memorial march in Moscow, numbers not seen at an opposition-linked event since mass anti-Putin rallies in 2011 and 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The powerful Investigative Committee leading the probe has offered several possible motives, including that the country's opposition could itself have ordered the hit on Nemtsov as "a sacrifice".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The murder took place in one of the most heavily policed areas of Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>However, some Russian media reports suggested that low-level criminals, not professional hit men, may have carried out the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The broadsheet said they used ammunition that was years old and possibly an unreliable home-made weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The murderer - or murderers - fired four bullets into Nemtsov's back and several more were found at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The weapon may have been a Makarov pistol, used by Russian armed forces, or an easily-acquired Izh gas pistol, converted to fire live rounds, the newspaper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A converted weapon of this type was used in 2006 to kill journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya at her home in central Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That murder remains unsolved.</td></tr>
