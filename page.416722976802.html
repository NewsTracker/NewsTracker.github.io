<h3>US: Baltimore lifts curfew, National Guard begins pullout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baltimore: Baltimore's mayor on Sunday lifted a curfew that was imposed across the East Coast city following widespread riots, as thousands of National Guard troops began withdrawing from the scarred metropolis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake had faced growing calls for the curfew to be scrapped, particularly from store and restaurant owners who said the 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM nightly restriction was wrecking business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"My goal has always been to not have the curfew in place a single day longer than was necessary," Rawlings-Blake wrote on Twitter on Sunday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I believe we have reached that point today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Baltimore took the unusual step of a citywide curfew after rioters torched cars, pelted police with stones and ransacked stores on April 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities imposed the curfew on April 28 after protests over the death of a man who sustained fatal injuries while in police custody turned violent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The curb on nighttime activity was initially supposed to remain in place until May 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The riots stemmed from protests over the death of Freddie Gray, 25, who suffered a serious spinal injury while in the back of a police van on April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He died a week later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>To help prevent repeat violence, authorities sent about 3,000 Maryland National Guard troops into Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Soon after the curfew ended, Governor Larry Hogan held a brief press conference and said the troops had already started to leave the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The trucks are pulling out this morning. It's going to take a little bit of a while," Hogan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's not going to happen instantaneously. It's going to take a couple of days to get everybody out. We had to build an entire city to save the city."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hogan called for "healing" and prayer in Baltimore and spoke of the financial ramifications of the riots and curfew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's going to be devastating," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Monday night we lost 200 businesses. Most of them were minority-owned businesses. Many of them didn't have insurance. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Friday, prosecutors said Gray should never even have been arrested and had committed no crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Six Baltimore police officers, three white and three black, were charged with multiple counts including second-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Baltimore's police union has condemned what it calls "an egregious rush to judgement," as it defended the officers and expressed confidence they would be cleared.</td></tr>
