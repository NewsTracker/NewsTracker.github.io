<h3>Joko Widodo says execution of Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will not be delayed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Indonesian President Joko Widodo says there has been no delay in plans to execute Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, despite the postponement this week of their transfer to the island where they are slated to be killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His remarks came as Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo was quoted as saying it was better for the pair to face a firing squad in the near future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We actually think the sooner the better," Mr Prasetyo said in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>According to Indonesian media reports of a press conference held at the presidential palace in Bogor late on Friday, Mr Joko insisted that any postponement in the transfer was due to "technical issues", rather than pressure from Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Moreover, there would be "no delay" in the executions themselves, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is our legal sovereignty," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is only about technical matters."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The comments are the first Mr Joko has made on the matter since last weekend, and since plans to move the pair to Nusakambangan island at midnight on Tuesday were cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Combined with Mr Prasetyo's reported remarks, they bode ill for Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Joko's reference to "technical matters" mirrors comments by Mr Prasetyo that the planned transfer could not go ahead because isolation rooms and executions fields were not ready on Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That rationale was later disputed by officials on the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Another reason given was that the families of the condemned men deserved more time with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran were arrested in 2005 after organising the smuggling of 8.3 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Joko also said the Australian government did not mean to put pressure on the Indonesian government to cancel the executions when Prime Minister Tony Abbott had brought up the tsunami relief Australia had given to Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Indonesian President said Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop had spoken with Vice-President Jusuf Kalla to clarify Mr Abbott's remarks that he wanted "reciprocity" in exchange for the $1 billion provided to Indonesia in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"She has explained that it wasn't the intention. Actually we wanted to say something but since it has been explained, we cancelled it," Mr Joko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ms Bishop appealed directly to Mr Kalla for an indefinite stay of execution for the Bali nine ringleaders, unveiling a fresh diplomatic push for the two countries to work together on tackling drug syndicates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Earlier on Friday, she told Fairfax Media she had telephoned Mr Kalla following Mr Abbott's comments pointing out the $1billion in aid Indonesia was given after the 2004 tsunami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Those comments were viewed by many to have inflamed the already-tense relationship over the planned executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ms Bishop told Fairfax Media she called Mr Kalla to clarify that Mr Abbott was not trying to link the two issues but merely emphasising the long history of support and friendship between the two countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A time-frame for the executions was not discussed during the phone call, in which she told the Vice-President that Australia was grateful for the delay in the transfer of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to Nusakambangan Island, where their executions are slated to take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I said I hoped we could seek an indefinite stay of execution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ms Bishop also expressed a hope that Indonesia and Australia could work together on ways to tackle the drug problem and drug syndicates.</td></tr>

<h3>Car bombs kill more than 30 in eastern Libyan city: speaker</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The three car bombs exploded in Qubbah, a small town near the seat of the official government in what appeared to be another high profile attack by the group after the storming of a Tripoli hotel and the killing of 21 captive Egyptian Copts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Monday, Egyptian air force jets bombed Islamic State targets in Derna in far eastern Libya, after the ultra-radical group released a video showing the Coptic Christian migrant workers being decapitated on a beach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"They killed and wounded tens in revenge for the bloodshed of Muslims in the city of Derna," said a statement issued by the "Islamic State, Cyrenaica province".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It could not be verified by Reuters but this group has issued statements before which were not subsequently contested by others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The bombs exploded shortly before Friday prayers at a petrol station, the local security headquarters and the town council in Qubbah, home town of Parliamentary Speaker Aguila Saleh, security officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His house is close to the town council, but he was out of town at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Forty-two people were killed, among them five Egyptian workers, and 70 people were wounded, security officials and medics said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Four years after rebels overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, the oil-producing North African state is in chaos, with two governments and parliaments allied to armed factions fighting for control, while Islamist groups exploit the power vacuum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Previous suicide and car bomb attacks, mainly in the east of Libya, have tended to target police and army bases rather than civilians, with security officials blaming Islamist groups such as Ansar al-Sharia which are believed to have links with militants claiming allegiance to Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are announcing seven days of mourning for the victims of Qubbah," Saleh told Al Arabiya television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I think this operation was revenge for what happened in Derna."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hours after the attacks, troops loyal to the official government used military helicopters to attack militant targets in Derna, a military source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>War planes also attacked forces loyal to the rival government in Ben Jawad, said Ali al-Hassi, a military spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The area is a launchpad for rival forces which have been trying to take the Es Sider oil port.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The internationally recognised prime minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, is based in Bayda, some 40 km (25 miles) from Qubbah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Saleh works out of Tobruk, another eastern town now home to the House of Representatives, the elected parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The capital Tripoli on the Mediterranean coast in the far west is under the control of the rival government and parliament, set up after a faction called Libya Dawn seized the city in summer, forcing Thinni to flee to the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Last month, militants claiming affiliation with Islamic State stormed the Corinthia luxury hotel in Tripoli, killing five foreigners and at least four Libyans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Supporters of the group, which has seized large areas of Iraq and Syria, have also taken over government and university buildings in Sirte, a central city and birthplace of Gaddafi, according to residents.</td></tr>
