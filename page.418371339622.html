<h3>Microsoft to lay off 7,800 from Nokia handset business</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Microsoft said on Wednesday it would cut 7,800 jobs and write down about $7.6 billion related to its Nokia handset business, which it acquired in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Most of the job cuts will be in the phone hardware business, underscoring the company's shift from hardware to its core software business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Redmond, Wash., company was widely expected to write off all or part of the $7.2 billion it paid for Nokia's handset unit, a deal that left the company with a money-losing business and only 3 percent of the smartphone market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Microsoft's shares, after opening up about 1 percent, slipped to about break-even, at $44.29, in early morning trading on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The latest round of job cuts is on top of the 18,000 job cuts the company announced last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Microsoft, which had more than 118,000 employees worldwide as of March 31, said it would take a restructuring charge of about $750 million-to-$850 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company said it would record the charge in the fourth quarter.</td></tr>
