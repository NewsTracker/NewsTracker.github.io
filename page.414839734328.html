<h3>McCartin could play in AFL against 'Dons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Coach Alan Richardson is rapt with how the key forward has coped with his first pre-season, saying his only hiccup had been a skin infection before Christmas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Saints have confirmed McCartin will line up in Saturday's game at their Seaford headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Richardson is unsure whether he will blood him in their opening NAB Challenge game against the Bombers on March 7 in Morwell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Essendon will field a team heavy with top-up players as they await the verdict from the AFL anti-doping tribunal hearing into their 2012 supplements scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We'll make a decision for the team and if he's in really good form, if he has a real understanding of his role, if physically he's in good enough shape ... without any compromise to his long-term, then absolutely he'll play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Richardson and chief executive Matt Finnis spoke at length on Tuesday about the state of the club, saying the Saints were raising expectations on and off the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After making the 2009-10 grand finals, the Saints have plummeted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They were bottom last season and the widespread expectation is they will take the wooden spoon again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the Saints have a new major sponsor and are bullish about members, saying they are about 4000 ahead of this time last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Richardson plans to be much tougher on his team this year, saying players would have to earn senior selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are a young group, but if you're good enough, you're old enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We need to raise expectations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Finnis said they were continuing to look at the feasibility of making some sort of return to their old Junction Oval ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They are also committed to a redevelopment of their most recent home at Moorabbin and will base a VFL team out of there from 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"People are quite sad - some are quite angry - that we've allowed Moorabbin to get into the state that it is right now," Finnis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It really doesn't befit the standing, the heritage role it's had in this club's history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We're going to revitalise Moorabbin ... give it the respect it deserves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There's no doubt we have to improve our connection with people and something like Junction Oval would be tremendously symbolic of moving closer to our heartland."</td></tr>
