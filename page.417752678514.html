<h3>Kirby inspires England to 2-1 win over Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>June 13 (Reuters) - Second-half goals from Francesca Kirby and Karen Carney lifted England to a 2-1 win against Mexico in Moncton on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kirby scored with an outstanding individual effort inside the penalty box to score England's first goal of the 2015 Women's World Cup in the 71st minute, while Carney headed in a pinpoint cross from Alex Greenwood in the 82nd minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kirby's goal was especially satisfying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The 21-year-old Reading striker quit the game four years ago due to depression as a result of dealing with her mother's death due to a brain hemorrhage when Kirby was 14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She and Carney rallied No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>6 to a much-needed lead before Mexico's Fabiola Ibarra gave her team hope with a goal in stoppage time, but there was little time for an equaliser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>England, 1-0-1, will finish its Group F stage against Colombia in Montreal, while Mexico, 0-1-1, will play France in Ottawa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Both games are set for Saturday.</td></tr>
