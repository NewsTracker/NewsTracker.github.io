<h3>Carrie no longer CIA officer in next season of 'Homeland'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"We're going to take about a two-year forward jump," Gansa said Friday at the opening night of PaleyFest, the annual TV celebration at the Dolby Theatre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On the purple carpet, Gansa said the next "Homeland" season will be filmed in Europe, most likely in Berlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said the setting would be Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The fourth season of "Homeland" was shot in Cape Town, South Africa, which doubled for Islamabad and Kabul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gansa later told the PaleyFest audience that CIA officer Carrie Mathison, played by series star Claire Danes, will no longer be an intelligence officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many of the "Homeland" crew members said the fourth season was critical to the series, given the death of the character of Brody, portrayed by Damian Lewis, on the third season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>So the show got a "reboot," said director Lesli Linka Glatter, referring to the fourth season's new plot direction and darker-than-ever twists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Showtime renewed the show for a fifth season in November.</td></tr>
