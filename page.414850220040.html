<h3>Nigeria military says it kills 300 Islamists as neighbors join fight</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The latest fighting comes as the tide has appeared to turn against Boko Haram, with neighbouring countries plagued by cross border attacks weighing in against the insurgents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Amid growing global concern, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Benin are preparing a 8,700-strong force to fight the Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Weapons and equipment were also captured and some destroyed," Nigerian defence spokesman Major-General Chris Olukolade said of the latest fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"However, two soldiers lost their lives while 10 others were wounded."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was not possible to independently verify the military's statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nigerian forces have in past been accused of overstating enemy casualties while greatly understating their own and those of civilians caught in the crossfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cameroonian forces supported by Chad's air force carried out air strikes and used heavy artillery against Boko Haram in the village of Gourgouroon, on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, Cameroon army spokesman Colonel Didier Badjeck said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In relentless attacks on military and civilians, Boko Haram have killed thousands and abducted hundreds since the group launched its violent campaign for a breakaway Islamic state in mid-2009, threatening the stability of Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer as well as that of the entire region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Boko Haram was cited as a reason for postponing by six weeks a Nigerian presidential election that had been due to take place this past Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Tuesday, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau appeared in a video monitored by the U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group in which he threatened to disrupt the upcoming vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The militants see democracy as un-Islamic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nigerian soldiers said they had recaptured the strategic town of Monguno, on the shores of Lake Chad where the four countries meet, from Boko Haram on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More than 5,000 people fled the town after the insurgents seized it last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Olukolade said troops had seized five types of armoured fighting vehicles, an anti-aircraft gun, 50 cases of bombs, eight different types of machine guns, some 50 cases of ammunition and 300 motorcycles the rebels use to launch attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chadian troops cleared Boko Haram out of the Nigerian town of Gamburu earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Niger soldiers shot dead a suicide bomber suspected of belonging to Boko Haram on Monday after he tried to detonate an explosive belt near a military post in the town of Bagara in southern Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At least 36 civilians were killed when an unidentified airplane bombed a border village in Niger, the Niamey government said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A local official in the village of Abadam blamed the Nigerian air force for the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A Nigerian military spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Violence in the northeast has hurt the re-election prospects of President Goodluck Jonathan, accused of doing too little to protect civilians from the militants, although recent victories could swing public opinion in his favour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The growing cooperation between Nigeria's neighbours is also attracting donor support to fight the Islamists, with the U.S. army providing equipment and intelligence to allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Presidents from the 10-nation Economic Community of Central African States (CEEAC) pledged on Monday to create an emergency fund of 50 billion CFA francs ($87 million) for the fight.</td></tr>
