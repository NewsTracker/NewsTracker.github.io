<h3>Penn State frat suspended over secret Facebook page</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A fraternity at Penn State University has been suspended as police investigate allegations that members used a secret Facebook page to post photos of nude women, some of whom appeared to be sleeping or passed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to a copy of a State College police warrant obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press, a former member of the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity came to authorities and told them about the page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The former member also turned over printouts from the page on a computer thumb drive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police say some Facebook posts also related to hazing and drug deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police say the investigation is ongoing to determine who made the posts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>WJAC-TV in Johnstown, which first reported the allegations, says the page had nearly 150 members, some current students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police told WJAC-TV that they searched several computers and the Facebook page after getting warrants, but "everything was already wiped clean."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The fraternity was suspended by Penn State's intrafraternity governing body and the national chapter pending further investigation.</td></tr>
