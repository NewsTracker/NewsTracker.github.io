<h3>Nigerian planes bomb Boko Haram camps, military says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"The death of a large number of terrorists has been recorded while many others are also scampering all over the forest," defence spokesman Major-General Chris Olukolade said on Thursday, later adding that an attack was under way on parts of Gwoza, the town where Boko Haram first declared an Islamic state last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After a year in which Boko Haram seemed to be gaining ground, seizing swaths of territory, killing thousands of people and kidnapping hundreds of mostly women and children, the tide may now be turning against them, as neighbouring countries plagued by cross-border attacks have weighed in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Niger, Chad and Cameroon are seeking to pin down Boko Haram within Nigeria's borders ahead of a ground-and-air offensive by a regional taskforce due to start from the end of next month, a senior Niger military official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sambisa gained notoriety last year when more than 200 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram from a secondary school in nearby Chibok were taken there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some of them escaped the forest shortly afterwards but most have remained in captivity ever since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Aerial surveillance of the forest has not revealed their whereabouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If some are still in the forest, air strikes against the rebels holding them captive could have grave risks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Military chiefs will meet in Chad's capital N'Djamena next week to finalise plans for a 8700-strong taskforce of troops from Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, Benin and Niger to fight the militants, although it is unclear how good co-ordination will be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nigerian forces backed by air power killed more than 300 Boko Haram fighters during an operation to recapture 11 towns and villages since the start of the week, the military said on Wednesday, though it was not possible to corroborate this and the military has been accused of exaggerating enemy casualties and understating its own and those of civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The risk to civilians from air strikes was highlighted on Tuesday, when an aircraft bombed a border village in Niger, the government of Niger said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A Nigerian security source said on Thursday that the plane was Nigerian and that the pilot had mistaken the civilians for fleeing insurgents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Retreating Boko Haram leaves mass of throat-slit...</td></tr>
