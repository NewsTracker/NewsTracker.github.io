<h3>Wall Street rises as Greece worries fade, data impresses</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in late morning trading on Wednesday on growing hopes that Greece would avert a default and as strong domestic data suggested the U.S. economic recovery was on track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece's international creditors signaled they were ready to compromise to avert a debt default, with the country's prime minister expected to hear the terms of the plan later on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Greece is driving the market sentiment today," said Marshall Gause, chief executive officer of Geneva Fund Partners in Denver, Colorado.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"As the risk around Greece is starting to significantly reduce, investors are putting back money into U.S. equities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The market also got a boost from data that showed U.S. trade deficit narrowed in April after surging in March, while companies picked up their hiring in May after a pullback the previous month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>U.S. private employers added a higher-than-expected 201,000 jobs last month, a ADP report showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The numbers are a precursor to the U.S. Labor Department's non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Investors have been keeping a keen eye on economic data for clues on the timing of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve - the first in nearly a decade.</td></tr>
