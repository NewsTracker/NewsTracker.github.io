<h3>Liberia, Sierra Leone gain in Ebola crisis; Guinea struggles</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia both appear to be on steady paths to ending the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Liberia's last Ebola patient died March 27; it is now counting down the 42 days it must wait to be declared free of Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FILE - In this file photo dated Friday, March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>27, 2015, a usually busy street is deserted as Sierra Leone enters a three day country wide lockdown on movement of people due to the Ebola virus in the city of Freetown, Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sierra Leone's 6 million people were told to stay home for three days, except for religious services, beginning Friday as the West African nation attempted a final push to rid itself of Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) - When will the world's largest and longest Ebola outbreak end?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The West African nations of Sierra Leone and Liberia both appear to be on a steady path to ending the epidemic - the wild card is Guinea, where Ebola hasn't burned as hot but remains stubbornly entrenched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the year since the first cases were identified in Guinea, Ebola has infected more than 25,000 people, the vast majority in West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Of those, around 10,500 have died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sierra Leone recorded no new infections Wednesday for the second time; on average, it has logged a handful each day in recent days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There are currently 62 patients in treatment in Sierra Leone, and a recent nationwide lockdown indicated there aren't hordes of hidden Ebola cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The battle to get to zero cases is truly on," Ernest Bai Koroma, Sierra Leone's president, said in a radio address Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's more difficult to discern a trend in Guinea - the World Health Organization has called the picture there mixed after noting signs of improvement last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Doctors Without Borders added 10 new beds to its Ebola treatment center in the capital, Conakry, last week to handle more patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>About half of the Donka center's 50 beds were full as of Tuesday, according to Raphael Delhalle, the group's field coordinator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The outbreak in Guinea has followed an undulating pattern for months and is likely to continue, Delhalle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Even though Ebola has spread longest in Guinea, the country has registered by far the fewest cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That's primarily because Ebola has yet to explode in a major Guinean city, as it did in the capitals of Sierra Leone and Liberia, said Dr. Dan Jernigan of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Guinea's president has implemented new measures to fight the outbreak, including mandating safe burials in hot spots and shutting any health center that finds an Ebola case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ebola is spread through bodily fluids of the sick and dead; burials and clinics are two major sources of infection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>One measure of whether an outbreak is being brought under control is how many new infections are in people known to have had contact with the sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That figure is only at about 50 percent in Guinea, WHO said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>WHO said about two-thirds of new cases in Sierra Leone arose in known contacts, a drop from the previous week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Fifteen percent of Ebola cases are still being confirmed only after death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Associated Press writers Clarence Roy-Macaulay in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Boubacar Diallo in Conakry, Guinea, contributed to this report.</td></tr>
