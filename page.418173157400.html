<h3>Greece asks for another bailout, but Angela Merkel says no deals before referendum</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dark clouds hover: A Greek flag flutters in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Athens: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has ruled out new negotiations with Greece until after it votes on a proposal from creditors, leaving virtually no hope left to avert a midnight default despite a plea from Athens for a last-minute bailout extension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As the clock ticked down on Tuesday towards midnight (9am AEST), when billions of euros in locked-up bailout funds are due to expire, euro zone finance ministers discussed the Greek request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel: "Before a referendum, as planned, is carried out, we won't negotiate on anything new at all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Merkel said there could be no new negotiations until after a July 5 referendum that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has called on an offer made last week by creditors, which Tsipras has told Greek voters to reject.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker appealed to Athens to accept the deal, while holding out hopes that some extra tweaks could still be possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tsipras, who says the creditors' proposals for pension cuts and tax hikes would ruin Greece, responded with a counter-proposal requesting a two-year deal covering funding support and debt restructuring, an issue the lenders have so far been reluctant to tackle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hinted that he may resign if his nation votes "Yes" in the referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If no agreement is reached, Greece will default on a loan to the International Monetary Fund, setting it potentially on a path out of the euro with unforeseeable consequences for both the EU's grand currency project and the global economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As the final hours approached, the proposals appeared so far apart that success seemed highly unlikely, with one well placed euro zone official saying there was "no way" euro zone finance ministers would release funds in time for the IMF payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Merkel, whose country is Greece's biggest creditor, made clear she believed time had run out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece's Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis gets on his motorbike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This evening at exactly midnight Central European Time the programme expires. And I am not aware of any real indications of anything else," she told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She later said Athens would be to blame for allowing the bailout program to expire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>EU and Greek government sources said Juncker had offered to convene an emergency meeting of euro zone finance ministers to approve an aid payment to prevent Athens defaulting, if the Greek leader sent a written acceptance of the terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A riot police officer adjusts his helmet in front of the Bank of Greece in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The growing risk of Athens being forced out of the single currency brought into sharp focus the chaos likely to be unleashed in Greece and the risks to the stability of the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"What would happen if Greece came out of the euro? There would be a negative message that euro membership is reversible," said Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who a week ago declared that he did not fear contagion from Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"People may think that if one country can leave the euro, others could do so in the future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A pro-Euro protester holds a T-shirt saying #GRinEuro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>EU leaders have hammered home the message that the real choice facing Greeks is whether to stay in the euro zone or return to the drachma, even though the EU has no legal way of forcing a member state to give up the single currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Former Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, leader of the main opposition party, said a "No" vote would push the country out of the single currency and wipe out wages and pensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The euro fell against the US dollar but European shares, which dropped sharply on Monday, steadied on hopes of a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Athens stock exchange is closed during a week-long shutdown of the banking sector which began on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Opinion polls show a majority of Greeks favour holding on to the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But a rally of tens of thousands of anti-austerity protesters in Athens highlighted the defiance many feel about being pushed into a corner by the lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Further rallies are expected in coming days, with a demonstration in favour of staying in the euro planned in central Athens on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Tsipras broke off negotiations with the Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank and announced the referendum on the bailout terms early on Saturday, giving voters just one week to debate the fundamental issues at stake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi warned against turning the referendum into a personality contest between Tsipras and Juncker or Merkel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"This is not a referendum on European leaders. This is a run-off vote: euro or drachma," Renzi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"The Greeks do not have to say whether they love their prime minister or the head of the European Commission more. They have to say whether they want to stay in the single currency."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Greece, which has received nearly 240 billion euros in two bailouts from the European Union and International Monetary Fund since 2010, is set to miss a 1.6 billion euro debt repayment to the IMF which falls due on Wednesday morning, Australian time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>If that happens, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde will immediately report to the global lender's board at close of business, Washington time, that Greece is "in arrears" - the official euphemism for default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>It will be the first time in the history of the IMF that an advanced economy has defaulted on a loan from the world's financial backstop, putting Athens, which has seen its economy contract by more than 25 per cent since 2009, in the same bracket as Zimbabwe, Sudan and Cuba.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Already the imposition of capital controls to prevent the crippled banking system from collapsing have given Greeks a bitter foretaste of the economic plunge that could follow exit from the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Withdrawal limits of 60 euros a day have been fixed for cash machines and there have been long queues at petrol stations and in supermarkets as worried shoppers have stocked up on essentials like pasta and rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>There were no immediate signs of serious shortages but if the banks remain closed, cash flow problems which have already been reported by some firms, could worsen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"So far there are no problems with suppliers, but if the banks are still closed next week there will be a bit of a problem if they demand purely cash payments," said Charisis Golas, owner of a small meat and dairy shop in Athens.</td></tr>
