<h3>Shields outpitches Bumgarner in Padres' 10-2 win vs Giants (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After a tame start to the season, the Padres hit the ball all over the yard to back new ace James Shields, who outpitched October nemesis Madison Bumgarner in a 10-2 victory against the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bumgarner, the World Series MVP, lasted only three innings, allowing five runs and 10 hits.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Matt Kemp had four hits, while Yangervis Solarte and Will Middlebrooks had three each.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Shields had a single, his first hit with the Padres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I've been waiting for one of these games to happen,'' said Kemp, the centerpiece addition in an offseason roster revamp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''This was a good game to get under our belt and kind of let everybody relax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''It came tonight,'' Kemp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Shields (1-0) held the Giants to one run and three hits in seven innings, struck out seven and walked one for his first victory with the Padres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He signed as a free agent in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He combined with two relievers to hold the Giants to five hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Bumgarner beat Shields, then with Kansas City, in Games 1 and 5 of the World Series, and then pitched five scoreless innings of relief in Game 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''It's a new team,'' Shields said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''My job is to beat whoever I'm opposing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I don't care if it's the Giants or the Dodgers or anybody else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>My job is to get a win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Bumgarner (1-1) allowed two hits each to Justin Upton, Derek Norris and Middlebrooks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''We had a lot of quality plate appearances,'' Padres manager Bud Black said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We were patient yet aggressive at the same time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>We were ready to hit and we were ready to hit mistakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>We laid off the borderline pitches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That goes to us really being aware of what this guy has, which is great stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He's a great pitcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Bumgarner said he had trouble with his release point ''and I just wasn't putting the pitches where I wanted to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I wasn't very effective and I need to get that all squared away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Everything was flattening out a little bit and I didn't have crispness on pitches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''I'm not taking anything away from those guys,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''You still have to hit the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Shields' only mistake was allowing a home run by Joaquin Arias leading off the fourth, his first this season.</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>Upton and Middlebrooks each had an RBI single.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>San Diego added three more in the third, when Norris, Middlebrooks and Jedd Gyorko hit consecutive RBI singles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Vogelsong took over starting the fourth and held the Padres until sixth, when they scored three more runs, one of them unearned.</td></tr>

<tr><td>38</td><td>''He told me I shouldn't be hitting BP,'' Shields said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''I wanted to hit a round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He said I'd be bunting a lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>So far it's been the complete opposite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>I haven't gotten the bunts down and I got a hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Giants: Third baseman Casey McGehee strained his left knee running out a fly ball in the first inning and came out of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>He was replaced by Arias.</td></tr>
