<tr><td>21</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the victory was compelling evidence that the U.S. strategy against IS was working.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said the Tikrit operation had been stalled for weeks but that coalition airstrikes and advancing local forces apparently caused IS fighters to withdraw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"What is clear is that over the last five days, this strategy of backing up Iraqi security forces that are multisectarian in nature with coalition airstrikes is a pretty powerful combination," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Earlier Wednesday, Iraqi security forces fired on snipers and searched homes for remaining militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Soldiers fanned out from the charred, skeletal remains of the Salahuddin provincial government complex, captured Tuesday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>30</td><td>He said the government will help displaced residents return and that a civil defense unit will be combing the city for roadside bombs and car bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Daesh is completely defeated," he added, using an Arabic name for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A satellite image of Tikrit, released in February by the U.N., showed at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Of those, at least 137 were destroyed and 241 were severely damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The current offensive also exacerbated previous damage, particularly in the south where clashes have been the most intense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Parliament speaker Salim al-Jabouri urged the government to find the means to resettle residents from damaged Tikrit buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He said this "requires effort and support by the central government in order to financially support the people in rebuilding their houses."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Aziz Jaber, a political science professor at Baghdad's Mustansiriyah University, said retaking Tikrit could be seen as the "beginning of the end" for the Islamic State group in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Daesh was very talented in psychological warfare, but not any more after its defeat in Tikrit," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"Now, the morale of the Iraqi forces is high, while that of Daesh is low."</td></tr>

<tr><td>41</td><td>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the IS group took control of large parts of the Yarmouk camp.</td></tr>

<tr><td>48</td><td>He said Wednesday's push into the camp showed coordination between IS and a rival group, the Nusra Front, al-Qaida's branch in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"The Nusra Front opened the road for them in order to infiltrate the camp and several hours ago they entered Yarmouk," Raja said by telephone.</td></tr>
