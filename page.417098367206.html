<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) " Andie MacDowell has been coming to Cannes for some 30 years, and she still knows how to slay on a red carpet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The actress and her show-stopping gown reigned as one of the highlights of Day Six at the Cannes Film Festival, a day where we also learned not to try and set up Colin Farrell for romance, John Turturro's inspiration for his temperamental character, and why amfAR is counting on Jeff Koons for big bucks.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>In his new sci-fi movie "The Lobster," Colin Farrell plays a single man desperate to get into a committed relationship or risk being transformed into an animal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In real life, though, he's unattached " and in no rush to change his status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"In my life I've had relationships with women that weren't in the public eye that have been pulled into the public eye as a result of the nonsense of celebrity and being close to me, and I hate that and I hated that for them," he said in an interview last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"And so that would be just another thing that would lead into my reticence to being in a relationship."</td></tr>

"</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>"I've seen behavior way more extreme than that," Turturro said of his character, an American star who wreaks havoc on the set of an Italian workplace drama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"From lots of people. And from directors, too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Moretti's tragicomedy, one of 19 competing for Cannes' Palme d'Or, centers on a director (Margherita Buy) whose latest project is coming unstuck even as her mother is dying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Turturro provides much of the film's humor as Barry Huggins, who propositions his director almost as soon as he steps off the train, struggles with his Italian dialogue and tells self-aggrandizing anecdotes about working with Stanley Kubrick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The film is a poignant meditation on losing a parent, and also provides a sharp insider's view of the movie business, with its egos and foibles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I've seen all kinds of crazy behavior," said Turturro, who won Cannes' best-actor prize in 1991 for "Barton Fink."</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>Swanky bashes go hand-in-hand with film festivals, and no more so than in Cannes, where the French Riviera and the luxurious surroundings are the perfect backdrop for the glitzy jetset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>One of the more fancy events occurred over the weekend, as David Unger, co-CEO of Three Six Zero Entertainment, held a brunch in a swanky home in the mountains outside of Cannes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Sunday's setting was so remote that guests " who included top models and Hollywood producers, directors and agents " were transported to the location via an Uber helicopter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>There have also been many yacht soirees and of course, film premiere after-parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Carol," a 1950s lesbian drama starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, received raves at its Monday premiere; afterward, the two co-stars changed from their red carpet ball gown attire to more relaxing but still glamourous attire and huddled up in a private area at the Grey Goose party as guards kept pesky guests seeking selfies with the stars away.</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>"I don't know the exact numbers but it shook up Hollywood. Both of the films made more money in China than they did in the US. The world is changing and a lot of things are leaning towards this part of the world," Li said.</td></tr>
