<h3>Greece signals summer concessions in bailout talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>People shop at a flea market at the northern port city of Thessaloniki, Greece, Wednesday, April 29, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece says it will discuss with its creditors on Thursday a draft bill of reforms it hopes will earn their approval and pave the way for the unlocking of vitally needed bailout funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece's Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis talks with a unionist during a protest by tax office employees outside the Finance ministry in Athens, Greece, Thursday, April 30, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece's finance minister on Thursday indicated his country could make concessions on key demands by bailout lenders - but only in the summer, after an initial deal to unlock delayed rescue funds is reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis made the comments as his reshuffled negotiating team prepared to meet bailout inspectors in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greece's creditors argue the country has fallen behind on long-terms reforms that would allow it to get back on its feet: lowering state funding for pensions, increasing turnover of staff in state jobs, further dismantling job protection rules, and simplifying sales-tax rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Greece's left-wing government argues the reforms cannot continue with the same speed and severity as in previous years, after the country suffered a drastic drop in output and increase in unemployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"After June, we are willing to look at many issues," Varoufakis told Sto Kokkino radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He signaled, for example, he'd be willing to raise some sales tax rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Varoufakis said he would "not move an inch" on such issues until an initial agreement is reached to unlock bailout money that Greece needs to avoid defaulting on debt obligations in coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Despite the tough stance, he said it would be possible to reach such a deal in the "next few days."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The confrontation with creditors has taken its toll on the fragile Greek economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Late Wednesday, Moody's ratings agency further downgraded the country's sovereign rating to Caa2 from Caa1, two notches above default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The main reason, it said, for the action was "the high uncertainty over whether Greece's government will reach an agreement with official creditors in time to meet upcoming repayments on marketable debt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Greece faces a tough debt redemption schedule in 2015, and it remains unclear whether it can cover a repayment to the International Monetary Fund on May 12 worth some 750 million euros ($840 million).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greece's Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis is surrounded by protesters and media workers as he arrives at the Finance ministry in Athens, Greece, Thursday, April 30, 2015.</td></tr>
