<h3>UPDATE 1-Facebook "tramples European privacy law" - Belgian watchdog</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS, May 15 (Reuters) - Belgium's privacy watchdog accused Facebook on Friday of trampling on European privacy laws by tracking people online without their consent and dodging questions from national regulators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Privacy Protection Commission (CPVP/CBPL), which is working with German, Dutch, French and Spanish counterparts, launched the blistering attack after trying to find out more about the U.S. social media giant's practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It urged Internet users to install privacy software to shield themselves from Facebook's tracking systems, whether they have an account with the social network or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The show of strength from the Belgian regulator, which does not have the power to levy fines, highlights a growing willingness across the 28-member bloc to demand that big U.S. tech companies abide by European laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Facebook tramples on European and Belgian privacy laws", the Commission said after publishing a report analysing changes that the company made to its privacy policies in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It said in a statement that Facebook had refused to recognise Belgian and other EU national jurisdictions, insisting it was subject only to the law in Ireland, the site of its European headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Facebook has shown itself particularly miserly in giving precise answers," the watchdog said, adding that the results of the study by a group of researchers were "disconcerting".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A Facebook spokeswoman questioned the Belgians' authority but said it would review the study's recommendations with the Irish data protection commissioner: "We work hard to make sure people have control over what they share and with whom."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Facebook is already regulated in Europe and complies with European data protection law, so the applicability of the CBPL's efforts is unclear," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some EU states accuse Ireland of being soft on the multinational firms it wants to attract, whether in data protection or corporate taxation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The commission said it would publish a second report on Facebook this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sanctions available to privacy watchdogs can be negligible to big firms, but a new EU data protection law expected to be ready this year would allow for fines up to 5 percent of annual sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The commission said Facebook would not explain in detail how it uses data it collects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It highlighted problems with plug-ins such as Facebook's "Like" button, which it said affected many who do not have a Facebook account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A number of firms are under fire in Europe over the data they collect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Facebook places tracking "cookies" when anyone visits a Facebook page, meaning it can track the online activities of a huge number of non-customers, but has said this is a bug that it is working to fix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Commission asked Facebook to stop gathering user data via cookies and plug-ins, except where users asked for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>European regulators have previously forced Google to change its privacy policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And a year ago, EU judges upheld a Spanish order that Google must remove links to outdated information from searches for people's names -- establishing a "right to be forgotten".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>EU anti-trust regulators launched a case against Google last month and are probing Apple and Amazon over low-tax deals with Ireland and Luxembourg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The European Commission is studying whether to pursue German and French proposals for an EU-wide regulator for Internet platforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some European politicians, also angered by revelations of U.S. espionage in Europe, say U.S. firms abuse their power, discouraging local start-ups and jeopardising privacy laws cherished by Europeans with memories of authoritarian rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama, who is trying to negotiate a landmark transatlantic free trade deal with the EU, TTIP, says Europe is throwing up protectionist barriers to tech companies.</td></tr>
