<h3>Alleged Canada Day terror plotters bickered about everything from drug addictions to body hair, court hears</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As they stuffed pressure cookers with rusty nails and shrapnel, John Nuttall occasionally harangued his wife Amanda Korody a bit too much, causing her to snap: "You are being a nuisance!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Similarly, when she didn't jump to attention at his command, he barked: "You're wasting time. Get on the logistics, please. I want targets!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She fired back: "I'm still cleaning!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Like radio's acerbic Bickersons or television's feuding Honeymooners, Nuttall and Korody were terrorism's testy twosome - each verbally giving as good as they got as tension mounted and they drew closer to the planned July 1 bombing at the provincial legislature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In this unique trial, now entering its second month, no one is on the stand testifying in B.C. Supreme Court again this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Instead, the jury on Monday was again watching and listening to a veritable epic-length movie of the alleged offences produced by an RCMP national security team over several months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They have seen an undercover Mountie pretending to be an Arab businessman buy the couple food, treat them as friends, drive them to buy parts for an explosive device, arrange a hotel room so they could build the bombs undisturbed, and encourage the jihadist attack in Victoria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Days of secret surveillance footage are being played of the elaborate sting that ended in the arrest of the pair, who have pleaded not guilty to four terrorism-related charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Forget the right to silence, the couple is captured in their most intimate moments - retching in the toilet, arguing over who drank a missing can of pop, whispering tendernesses: Their jibes, boasts, doubts, hopes, dreams and, even, prayers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Throughout, the streaming conversation captured by the hidden cameras and microphones ranges from the banal - what will happen to their cat after martyrdom - to the chilling: rusty nails are used to ensure those wounded and maimed would later suffer from tetanus and infection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At the moment, in the prosecution's seeming documentary, it is June 28, 2013, and the pair is in a Delta motel room awaiting the arrival of the plot's linchpin - a Mr. Big-style character known as The Other Brother, who can provide explosives and guns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Like any good soap opera, suspense is building as Nuttall and Korody express misgivings about the murderous operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Much of the time, the soundtrack is a playlist of nasheeds - the hypnotic Arabic chants or songs of blood and devotion that have been turned into a recruiting tool by the extremist group ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An musical tradition dating from the 8th century, the nasheeds were resurrected as a form in the 1970s on cassette tapes circulated by the Muslim Brotherhood and others that featured sermons by radical imams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Osama bin Laden, for instance, belonged to a nasheed group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Along with the nasheeds, Nuttall and Korody also listen to Islamic lectures to improve their theological understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They want to make a good impression with The Other Brother, but Nuttall - who rehearses his rudimentary Arabic - is worried that with their continuing drug issues and wavering resolve, he may not want them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Other Brother will not be impressed by "two junkies," he noted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We're going to war. & Do you want to jihad or not?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Nuttall gleaned the plans for the homemade bombs from the al-Qaida Internet magazine, Inspire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>His dream was to be part of a victorious, black-clad Islamic army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At one point, he mocked the security services and police for relying so heavily on forensic science and video security cameras to make arrests and win convictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That's the reason they were being so careful, he explained to Korody - wearing gloves, hair coverings and cleaning everything connected with the pressure cookers - hypersensitive to leaving the slightest trace of DNA much less a latent fingerprint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Korody suggested wearing double gloves and he happily agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Gleeful at the expected frustration of future investigators, he added sarcastically, mimicking a police officer: "What, there's no video? There's no DNA? You mean our job's not done for us? Put an ad on the TV [asking people] to turn this man in and do our job for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The trial was adjourned early Monday as Korody was feeling nauseous.</td></tr>

<h3>Georgia halts execution of state's only female death row inmate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, condemned for the murder of her husband in 1997, would have been the first woman executed by the state in 70 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the Execution Team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy," Georgia Department of Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, Inmate Gissendaner's execution has been postponed," Hogan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was not immediately clear to when the execution would be rescheduled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prosecutors said Gissendaner plotted with her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, to kill her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, who was stabbed to death in a desolate area in suburban Atlanta after being abducted from his home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Owen confessed to carrying out the Feb. 7, 1997, murder and implicated Kelly Gissendaner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He is serving a life sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Gissendaner's execution by injection was reset for Monday night at a prison in Jackson, Ga., after a winter storm prompted state officials to postpone it last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday afternoon turned down Gissendaner's request for a stay of execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gissendaner's attorneys had also asked the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to reconsider its decision last week to deny her request to commute the sentence from death to life without parole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The board denied that request on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Her lawyers made an 11th-hour argument to the U.S. Supreme Court after an appeals court rejected her attorneys' request for a delay, saying that Georgia's lethal injection process is not transparent enough to be challenged in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a Supreme Court filing, they argued that the court also should note that she did not kill her husband herself and had reformed herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In their clemency petition to the parole board, Gissendaner's lawyers said the death row inmate has "accepted responsibility" for her actions and has "shown a commitment to seeking redemption through spiritual growth and serving others."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The state last executed a woman on March 5, 1945.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Lena Baker died in the electric chair but was granted a pardon in 2005 after officials said she should have been given clemency for killing her abusive employer in self-defence.</td></tr>
