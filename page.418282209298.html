<h3>England beats Germany 1-0 in extra time to finish 3rd (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Days after a gut-wrenching loss, England finished its deepest run in the Women's World Cup with an uplifting victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>No last-minute heartbreak this time around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Just a solid all-around performance for Steph Houghton and company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Houghton's nifty legwork prevented an own goal and Fara Williams scored on a penalty kick in the 108th minute, leading England to a 1-0 victory over top-ranked Germany in the third-place game Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''This is the team we wanted to be,'' coach Mark Sampson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''We wanted to show the nation that, look, we can be knocked down, but we can also get back up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Karen Bardsley stopped seven shots as England rebounded quite nicely from Wednesday's 2-1 loss to Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That semifinal was decided in the final minute of second-half stoppage time when Laura Bassett directed the ball into her own net.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The response by the sixth-ranked Lionesses was their first victory over Germany in 21 meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''To finally beat Germany is a real big statement from this team, and something these players will be remembered for,'' the 32-year-old Sampson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>England finished the tournament with a 5-1-1 record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It had never won an elimination game in the Women's World Cup in three previous appearances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For Germany, which lost 2-0 to the United States on Tuesday, it was a disappointing finish for the two-time champions and raised further concerns about whether the nation's women's program is beginning to slip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since winning back-to-back World Cup titles in 2003 and 2007, the eight-time European champions have a 2-3 post-preliminary round record in the past two tournaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It was the last World Cup game for German coach Silvia Neid and goalkeeper Nadine Angerer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Neid is retiring after the 2016 Rio Games, while Angerer is retiring from the national team following this tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''It's very sad, but that's how it is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This is reality,'' Neid said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''In the end, I think England had more chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lianne Sanderson set up the only goal when she was pulled down by Tabea Kemme while attempting to get to a pass into the penalty area to the right of the goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Williams scored her third goal of the tournament - and second on a penalty kick - by punching the ball just inside the left post while Angerer faded the other way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Neid said the penalty was justified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>England avoided a major scare in the eighth minute, when Jo Potter came inches away from scoring into her own goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Germany's Sara Daebritz sent a pass into the penalty area, and teammate Bianca Schmidt headed it toward the net.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Unaware that Bardsley was preparing to catch the ball, Potter leaped and got her head on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The ball caromed toward the goal, where Houghton was facing the net and kicked it back over her head inches before it crossed the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Bardsley said she wants to frame the picture of the captain preventing the goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''I think that picture will forever be etched in my mind of Steph's leg above her head, practically touching the crossbar,'' Bardsley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''I think that epitomizes that this team is about in my opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Germany had several opportunities to tie the game in the final 10 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Anja Mittag, off a free kick just outside the penalty area, found an opening and got a shot off that was scooped up Bardsley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In the 116th minute, Schmidt got behind England's defense and headed a cross just wide of the right post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Lionesses' success in Canada has created a large buzz back home, where they attracted support from Prince William and men's national team captain Wayne Rooney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Sampson has become one of the team's most vocal supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>After beating Germany, he decided it might be time for a brief break to enjoy the moment when asked how the Lionesses build on this performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''Look, all I'm concerned about is having a good time tonight, if I'm honest,'' Sampson said, with a big grin.</td></tr>
