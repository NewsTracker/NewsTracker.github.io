<h3>Egypt Basks in World Support at Investor Conference</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt's president claimed broad support from the international community for his vision of the future on Sunday, in a boisterous speech to an investor conference that saw billions pledged to boost an economy left battered by four years of turmoil following a popular uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A jubilant Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi acknowledged Egypt's road to recovery will be long and costly, but described the three-day summit as an overwhelming success, recognizing companies and governments for their vote of confidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I would like to thank you all who came to the event - envoys, deputies or prime ministers, and of course monarchs and kings and princes," he told a packed auditorium in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where crowds gave him several standing ovations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You have no idea how happy you've made the Egyptian people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the meeting's closing, a teary-eyed Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab said the conference had netted $36.2 billion in investments that had been signed and were ready to be implemented, thanking allies for the support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dozens of town residents drove up to the conference center as the meeting closed, waving Egyptian flags, honking their horns in celebration, and causing a brief traffic jam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many questions had lingered in the run-up to the conference - whether it would meet expectations for billions in investment, whether companies would be ready to overlook political risks in a country with a lingering militant insurgency, and whether political leaders would be willing to set aside concerns over human rights and vocally back the leadership of el-Sissi, who overthrew his Islamist predecessor in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's a great show of support from investors and world leaders, and an excellent way to hold the government to account for the ambitious policies it has announced," said Angus Blair of investment advisory firm Signet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Besides major Gulf backers United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, who kicked off the conference by announcing over $12 billion in aid and investment, Western powers including the United States, France, Britain and Italy also praised the steps el-Sissi has taken over the past year, a message that was echoed by those from international institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>El-Sissi has staked his legitimacy on fixing the economy and restoring security to the Arab world's most populous country, and the three-day conference had sought a clear sign of international confidence in its political stability, after a 2011 revolt that overthrew longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, followed by military rule and the one-year reign of an elected but divisive president, the Islamist Mohamed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Since Morsi's ouster, led by then-army chief el-Sissi, the government has cracked down hard on his Muslim Brotherhood, other Islamists and secular and liberal activists, with hundreds killed and thousands imprisoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The country is also fighting Islamic militants in a corner of the Sinai Peninsula a few hundred kilometers (miles) to the north - a long-running insurgency that picked up after Morsi's overthrow.</td></tr>

<h3>50 Cent would "happily" sign 1D star to label</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Speaking to The Irish Sun, the 39-year-old said: "If Zayn wants a rap career, just because of who he is, he is going to sell records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He continued: "I'd happily sign him up to my label, mentor him and have him working with the biggest rappers on the planet.</td></tr>
