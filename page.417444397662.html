<h3>Nigeria's new president to visit Chad, Niger on 1st trip; all nations fighting Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's new president will visit Chad and Niger, making the countries whose troops help fight Boko Haram a priority on his first official travels outside the country, an official said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>President Muhammadu Buhari will fly to Niger on Wednesday and Chad on Thursday, spokesman Garba Shehu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chad leads a multinational force of troops, including soldiers from Cameroon, in an offensive that this year has driven Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremists from towns and villages where it had established "an Islamic caliphate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Both Chad and Niger have complained of a lack of cooperation from Nigeria, which has strained relations with all its neighbors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Battle-hardened Chadian troops have had to retake some towns from Boko Haram several times because Nigerian troops haven't arrived to secure them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Buhari was a major general in the army in the 1980s when he drove invading Chadian troops out of Nigeria in an unresolved dispute over an oil-rich border area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Presidents Idriss Deby of Chad and Mahamadou Issoufou of Niger were both at Buhari's inauguration on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Buhari has said that having foreign troops on Nigerian soil is a "national disgrace" and he is expected to want Nigeria to lead the multinational force approved by the African Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The force still awaits a U.N. Security Council resolution on which international funding depends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The previous Nigerian administration had argued that the U.N. intervention shouldn't be based on Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, which can require military enforcement, but instead on Chapter 8, which recognizes the role of regional organizations in promoting peace and security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Buhari, a former military dictator, has promised better cooperation with his neighbors and to crush Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nigeria's military has said the offensive has cut Boko Haram's supply lines across borders and that the militants' main fighting force is hemmed into a northeastern forest stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Boko Haram fighters have returned to their old hit-and-run attacks with suicide bombings and occasionally cross-border raids continuing.</td></tr>
