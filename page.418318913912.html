<h3>Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis resigns: statement in full</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis resigned claiming he was forced to do so when the creditors demanded his absence from future talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This is his statement in full.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The referendum of 5 July will stay in history as a unique moment when a small European nation rose up against debt bondage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Like all struggles for democratic rights, so too this historic rejection of the Eurogroup's 25 June ultimatum comes with a large price tag attached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It is, therefore, essential that the great capital bestowed upon our government by the splendid no vote be invested immediately into a yes to a proper resolution - to an agreement that involves debt restructuring, less austerity, redistribution in favour of the needy, and real reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Soon after the announcement of the referendum results, I was made aware of a certain preference by some Eurogroup participants, and assorted "partners", for my | "absence" from its meetings; an idea that the prime minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For this reason I am leaving the ministry of finance today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I consider it my duty to help Alexis Tsipras exploit, as he sees fit, the capital that the Greek people granted us through yesterday's referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And I shall wear the creditors' loathing with pride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>We of the left know how to act collectively with no care for the privileges of office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>I shall support fully Prime Minister Tsipras, the new minister of finance, and our government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The superhuman effort to honour the brave people of Greece, and the famous oxi (no) that they granted to democrats the world over, is just beginning.</td></tr>
