<h3>Wolf Alice, Courtney Barnett, Errors: this week?s new live music</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The woolly, superfuzzed guitars; the quiet moments, crushingly followed by the loud ones; the ad hoc attempts at guitar solos: Wolf Alice have all those, just slightly slicker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Though it seems a contradiction in terms, this London quartet offer clean grunge: as powerful as the noise is that they generate, the voice and angular guitar of Ellie Rowsell are more clearly articulated than you might imagine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And with the band taking five years to come up with their debut album, there's the suggestion of a plan at work here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A Sea Of Split Peas, the first UK release by Courtney Barnett, introduced us to a format (the "double EP") and a talent as singular as one another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A singer-songwriter from Melbourne, Barnett didn't reinvent the wheel - offering fairly scruffy slacker rock with wry lyrics (Pavement have been mentioned) - but she did so while maintaining a crazy schedule, including working a day job and running her own label.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fact that she was a prolific songwriter wasn't only completely at odds with her manner, but showed admirable time-management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Barnett's debut album proper, Sometimes I Sit And Think And Sometimes I Just Sit, seems to provide a more accurate representation of her situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There's still the site-specific local detail, and a great charm, but the music has mounted in intensity, as if to suggest this is someone who knows precisely where they are heading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While their patrons and labelmates Mogwai are post-rock, Glaswegian trio Errors are thought to occupy a more scientific-sounding genre: post-electro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If that initially sounds a little forbidding, it's worth exploring how Simon Ward, Stephen Livingstone and James Hamilton make it work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As it applies to their fifth album, Lease Of Life, it's by creating 80s synth-pop, but as if it has been exploded in space: a place of diffuse elements, pleasantly burbling sequences and vocal refrains, coinciding in fortuitous alignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It can be a sad business; when they head towards more conventional songs, they sound a bit like the Blue Nile gone techno.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In terms of fellow travellers, you might want to think in terms of a solar system, with Zombie Zombie, Umberto and Fuck Buttons nearby, relative to everything else, but still many light years apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Quoted as a key early influence by Oneohtrix Point Never, Fennesz's music is characterised by impressionistic sweeps of expanded guitar lines and laptop effects, which here will be paired with abstract moving collages by audiovisual artist Lillevan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Starting out as a guitar player, Fennesz became obsessed with distortion, which emerged as a signature sound, centred around slow decay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He hasn't strayed far from that path since, with a string of releases on the Touch and Editions Mego labels, among others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although not the first time the pair have worked together, this collaboration is a UK first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It takes the work of Gustav Mahler as source material, over which Fennesz plays what he calls a "live remix", generating heavy clouds of disintegrating melody augmented by washes of painterly, textural visuals from Lillevan that typically slip out of focus, just as you think you can make out a shape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Norway's Jazzland label has brought the world some remarkable musicians, and Oslo-born saxophonist Hakon Kornstad (playing the second of three Jazzland shows at Kings Place) comes very high on the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kornstad discovered John Coltrane via the work of his own compatriot Jan Garbarek, but his evolution under those influences soon took some unusual turns, into opera, as well as highly imaginative use of samples and loops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Kornstad's shows have been described in terms of symphonic music rather than unaccompanied performance, and his 2007 solo album Single Engine was widely admired for its rare blend of edginess and lyricism, displaying an emotional warmth even in its most abstract episodes.</td></tr>

<h3>Confidence in Ukraine's cease-fire hurt by arms violations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The OSCE was tasked to verify the pullback of heavy weapons by the Ukrainian government forces and the rebels in eastern Ukraine under a cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NOVOAMVROSIIVSKE, Ukraine (AP) - With cameras and clipboards in hands, teams of blue-jacketed international observers drive around the muddy countryside of eastern Ukraine looking for rocket launchers and artillery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Their task is to verify whether government troops and Russian-backed rebel forces are removing heavy weapons from the front line in accordance with a February cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The success of the Organization for Security and Europe monitoring mission would lessen the chances that heavy fighting will resume in conflict that has already left more than 6,000 dead in a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Evidence is emerging, however, that the warring sides are leading monitors on a time-wasting game of hide-and-seek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Friday, an Associated Press journalist saw two tanks and two 120 mm guns being taken toward the front in rebel territory, near the separatist-held city of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two days earlier, Ukrainian troops were seen transporting a tank and a large-caliber gun in the town of Avdiivka, which also lies right on the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>None of the weapons should have been there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Under a peace deal laboriously negotiated between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, anything with a caliber of 100 mm or above should be pulled back 25 to 70 kilometers (15 to 45 miles) from the front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The weapons withdrawal began the last week of February and both sides claim to have completed the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the OSCE says to make sure the pullbacks happened, it must know how many weapons each side has and where they are being stored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Some information has been provided from both sides, but we still need substantial information," said Michael Bociurkiw, the OSCE mission spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Friday, a group of inspectors in rebel territory traveled from Donetsk to Novoamvrosiivske, a village near the Russian border where AP journalists on Feb. 26 followed four trucks carrying Grad launchers to a cement factory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In that same cement factory, monitors scrutinized dozens of tanks, rocket launchers and howitzers, eyeing serial plates, taking photos and writing down notes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Where serial numbers were scratched away, a photo was taken of that missing information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In separatist areas, OSCE teams have to ask in advance for permission to visit sites they wish to see and they travel under the supervision of rebel fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"They have complained to us that they can move around freely on Ukrainian territory," one rebel fighter, who gave his name as Major Yegorov, told the AP in Novoamvrosiivske.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"That is true, but on that territory there is no fighting. The war is here, in the southeast. So we control them because we want to provide safety for them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It is unclear to what extent the OSCE teams are able to decide on their own where to inspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On the road back to Donetsk after the Novoamvrosiivske inspection, fresh tracks on the asphalt in the Donetsk suburb of Makiivka appeared to indicate that a convoy of heavy machinery had passed through since the morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The OSCE team drove past, but an AP journalist followed the tracks to find two tanks in a multi-vehicle convoy that included truck-pulled cannons and troop carriers full of rebel fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>On Wednesday, two days earlier, a Ukrainian soldier told an AP reporter, laughing, that a cease-fire agreement-busting cannon that was being taken toward the front had a "90-something mm caliber."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The weapon was clearly more powerful than that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Ukrainian military officials have at times conceded that they are refraining from a complete withdrawal of heavy weapons, citing what they say is rebel reluctance to do the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We will not withdraw all our weapons, as we have no confirmation that the same is being done by the enemy," military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters March 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"It would be wrong and criminal to leave our troops without any cover."</td></tr>
