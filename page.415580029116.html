<h3>MH17: Fragment from crash site matches a Russian-made rocket, Dutch TV reports</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Amsterdam: A metal fragment from the crash site of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 matches a surface-to-air BUK rocket, a Dutch broadcaster has said, supporting a theory that the plane was downed by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The fragment was recovered by a Dutch journalist from the village of Hrabove several months ago near where the plane was brought down last July, killing all 298 passengers and crew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dutch broadcaster RTL said it had had the shrapnel tested by international forensic experts, including defence analysts IHS Jane's in London, who said it matched the explosive charge of a BUK, a Russian-made anti-aircraft missile system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The downing of the plane was a turning point in the conflict in Ukraine, which pits the separatists against Kiev's forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kiev and its Western supporters blamed the rebels for the incident and it stiffened the resolve of Western governments to impose sanctions against both leading separatists and Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Dutch Safety Board, which is investigating the cause of the crash, said in a reaction that its investigation was in "full progress and focuses on many more sources than only the shrapnel".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In preliminary conclusions published last year, the board said the plane had been hit by high velocity projectiles but did not specify the source.</td></tr>

<h3>World Cup 2022 final in Qatar will be on December 18</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The governing body confirmed its executive committee followed the recommendation of a task force set up to examine the dates of the event in Qatar by moving it to November-December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It also decided the final should take place on Sunday, Dec 18 &#x2013; Qatar National Day &#x2013; with the tournament scheduled &#x201c;in principle&#x201d; to last 28 days, half a week shorter than usual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fifa&#x2019;s director of communications Walter De Gregorio said: &#x201c;The ExCo decided today that the World Cup as proposed by the task force, as you know, will be played in November-December, with the final on the 18th of December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>&#x201c;Based on the proposal of the task force, we&#x2019;re going to try to play in 28 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the decision in principle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>De Gregorio confirmed the dates had been proposed by Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, the head of the task force, and were accepted by his fellow ExCo members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>&#x201c;This is, for us, an important step,&#x201d; he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>&#x201c;Finally, we know the end of the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Sunday and, by the way, it&#x2019;s the national day in Qatar, so it fits perfectly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fifa president Sepp Blatter had already promised the tournament would finish &#x201c;no later&#x201d; than December 18 following a backlash against a proposal for the final to be played two days before Christmas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Stakeholders will now seek to limit the damage caused by the switch to their own competitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Uefa president Michel Platini, who voted for Qatar to stage the 2022 tournament, was first to make his case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>&#x201c;December 18 is a good date for the final &#x2013; perhaps December 23 would be too late if you are trying to get all the fans back on December 24,&#x201d; he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>&#x201c;December 18 is fine for Uefa &#x2013; we can accommodate any changes to the Champions League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>&#x201c;But Fifa must now protect the international dates for the national associations &#x2013; there are four international matches that could be affected and those are the lifeblood for the national associations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The decision to move the World Cup was taken more than four years after the most controversial award of a sporting event in history, one plagued by allegations of bribery and corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Qatar&#x2019;s shock victory in the race for the 2022 tournament was achieved in defiance of warnings about the extreme summer temperatures in the country, which can exceed 50 degrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That led to immediate calls for a winter switch but it has taken until this week for Fifa to resolve the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Opposition to the move appears to have been quelled, although at a financial cost to the game&#x2019;s world governing body that could run into hundreds of millions, if not billions, of pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The last hurdle appears a deal with the European Club Association &#x2013; members of which include Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea &#x2013; to compensate it over the release of players for the next two World Cups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That could be announced following this week&#x2019;s Fifa ExCo meeting and is expected to total around 150 million for Qatar 2022 alone, three times the amount paid for last year&#x2019;s tournament in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Premier League has resigned itself to a November-December switch, with the division itself likely to restart on Boxing Day, more than a week after the World Cup final.</td></tr>
