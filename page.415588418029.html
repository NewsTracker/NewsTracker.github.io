<h3>Athlete&#039;s Foot owner buys Dr Martens, Vans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>With one foot in a Doc Martens boot and the other in a Vans sneaker, the owner of The Athlete's Foot is stepping into new territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>RCG Corporation will pay up to $200 million for New Zealand's Accent Group, which owns sneaker chain Platypus Shoes and exclusive distribution rights to popular youth and street brands Vans, Dr Martens and Timberland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The deal will increase RCG's store numbers by 97 to 269, and lift total sales from $267 million to $450 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Accent's brands, which also includes Skechers and Palladium, will open up RCG to new customers, offering a point of difference to the runners and sports shoes sold through its major chain The Athlete's Foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"That was obviously the appeal for us," RCG chief executive Hilton Brett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It provides us with a complimentary business - a complimentary portfolio of brands - rather than one that cannibalise your business."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The move has expanded RCG's brand portfolio from six to 13 licenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Brett said this would improve the company's ability to respond to changes in a competitive retail market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It also means RCG and Accent can sell each other's brands and make the most of their retail coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We think that Skechers is an opportunity to drive further growth through The Athlete's Foot," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>RCG brands Caterpillar, Sperry and Saucony may also soon appear on shelves in Platypus Shoes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The timing for the acquisition was right for RCG, Mr Brett said, after a new board helped build its market value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We've been looking over the years for the right opportunity," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As part of the deal, three of Accent's four shareholders will join the RCG board, subject to shareholder approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>RCG will also aim to raise $125 million through a capital raising with investors and shareholders to help fund the acquisition.</td></tr>

<h3>At SXSW, folk-roots mother-son duo build buzz</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear consist of 26-year-old Madisen and his mother, Ruth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The duo has been building buzz at coffee houses for nearly six years in their hometown of Kansas City, Missouri with their striking, folk-roots sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It led to a recording contact, signed in October, with Glassnote Records - the home label to Mumford & Sons and Phoenix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They've already performed on "Late Show with David Letterman" and will release their debut album on May 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"When we're playing together, I don't look at Madisen, my son, I look at my fellow musician," Ruth said in an interview Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He can get mad at me and it won't affect me - well, a little bit," she adds, as Madisen laughs and says, "And vice versa."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I hate to say it - it's kind of not really mother and son that much whenever we play music. And then as soon as we come off, we're right back," Madisen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"When it comes to the business, we're being business people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Madisen is the chief songwriter and lead vocalist of the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ruth, who sings as well, edits the songs and vocals with her son to round out their sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And they both play guitar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We are hard on each other though," he said after taping a Daytrotter session at Danny's Studios in Austin, Texas - one of many performances slated around the South by Southwest festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Their honesty - and directness - pierces throughout the 12-track "Skeleton Crew," which they recorded in Nashville this winter with producer Jim Abbiss (Adele, Arctic Monkeys).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ruth, a veteran performer, has recorded albums, played in bands and sang solo since she was 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said she initially grew up listening to Motown, but that changed when her brother introduced her to acts like Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Simon & Garfunkel and Peter, Paul and Mary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Madisen, the youngest of her three children, grew up watching his mother perform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And as he got older, he would join her onstage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I'm sure she thought this was a dream that was far gone, not necessarily something she was going to pursue again, and for it to come back to life and know that I can be a part of that, I think about that often," Madisen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I think it's incredible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I am very proud of my son ...and sometimes I can get choked up when I think about it," Ruth said, looking at Madisen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I just see him becoming who he is. ...I'm blessed to have him as my son."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear, a mother and son duo consisting of Madisen Ward, left, and Ruth Ward, pose for a photograph during the SXSW Music Festival on Wednesday, March 18, 2015 in Austin, Texas.</td></tr>
