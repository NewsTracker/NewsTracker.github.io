<h3>Blatter rejects demands from UEFA for him to resign</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter says he intends to help restore trust in world soccer after a pair of corruption investigations brought "shame and humiliation" on the sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blatter spoke publicly for the first time since the corruption scandals broke Wednesday and threw FIFA into crisis ahead of Friday's presidential election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter blamed the "actions of individuals" and said corruption "has to be stopped now" to prevent FIFA's reputation from being "dragged through the mud."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Blatter rejected demands from European association UEFA that he resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He is expected to win a fifth term in Friday's election against Prince Ali of Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>American and Swiss authorities are pursuing separate federal investigations into racketeering and the 2018 and 2022 World Cup votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>UEFA President Michel Platini says some European countries might pull out of FIFA and the World Cup if Sepp Blatter wins a fifth term as FIFA president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Speaking at a news conference in Zurich, Platini said through a translator that the European football body will be "open to all options" but insisted that he opposes a boycott of FIFA - even if longtime president Blatter beats Prince Ali of Jordan in Friday's election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Platini says he expects that a majority of European countries - at least 45 - will vote for the Jordanian royal in the 209-nation election after UEFA backed down from a threat to boycott the FIFA Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Platini said he told Blatter directly in a meeting on Thursday morning to stand down before the ballot - but the FIFA chief refused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Platini lamented "too many scandals" and said "FIFA doesn't deserve to be treated that way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>With FIFA engulfed by a corruption scandal prompted by an investigation by U.S. authorities announced Wednesday, Platini said that Ali "doesn't need money because he is a prince."</td></tr>
