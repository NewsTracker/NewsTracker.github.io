<h3>Fight for Iraqi city of Tikrit draws Tehran and Washington still closer together</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's unclear how many Iranian troops are on the ground for the campaign to wrest control of Salaheddin province, and the strategic city of Tikrit, back from IS, but some are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>More importantly, their leader is the head of Iran's paramilitary Quds Force, Major-General Qasim Suleimani, and Iranian-trained, Iraqi Shiite militias are boasting that they make up more than two-thirds of a 30,000-strong force marshalled by Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In an eerie echo of the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields during the Gulf War, IS militants set fire to oil wells north-east o Tikrit to obstruct an assault by Shiite militia and Iraqi soldiers trying to drive them from the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A witness and a military source said IS fighters ignited the Ajil oil field to shield themselves from attack by Iraqi military helicopters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>US officials deny any coordination with the Iranians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But, according to The New York Times, US war planners monitor the Iranian war effort by various means - including the use of radio channels that each side knows are used by the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And Iraqi command centres also act as intermediaries, to ensure that there is no conflict between the forces of Washington and Tehran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A volunteer Shiite fighter prepares to join the battle against IS for control of the Iraqi city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>US and Australian military trainers are still working to retrain the Iraqi Army, which collapsed in the face of IS attacks last year, which means that the ground campaign that is such an essential adjunct to the US-led air campaign against IS is effectively being run from the Iranian capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Former Obama special adviser Vali Nasr, now dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, told the Times: "The only way the Obama administration can credibly stick with its strategy is by implicitly assuming that the Iranians will carry most of the weight and win the battles on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"You can't have your cake and eat it too - the US strategy in Iraq has been successful so far largely because of Iran."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The battle for Salaheddin is not the first such joint effort - General Suleimani led an Iranian contingent on the ground while the US bombed from the air to help win the Shiite town of Amerli back from IS control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And when it seemed that IS was within striking distance of the northern Kurdish stronghold of Erbil, it was the Quds Force leader who arrived with two aircraft laden with military supplies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Appearing before a congressional committee this week, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, made a discreet nod to the Iranian contribution when he said that the involvement of the Iranian-trained militias, all drawn from Iraq's Shiite community, could be "a positive thing".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He went on: "This is the most overt conduct of Iranian support, in the form of artillery and other things - frankly, it'll only be a problem if it results in sectarianism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Others in the region are not so sure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On the adjournment of the nuclear talks in Switzerland this week, US Secretary of State John Kerry headed to the Middle East - to assure the Sunni Arab regimes that in its dealings with Tehran, Washington would not "go wobbly", as the late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher warned former US president George H. W.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Bush during the Kuwait crisis in 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Riyadh was not convinced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A complaint by the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, addressed the battle for Tikrit in particular - it was, he said, an indication of Iran's "hegemonic" tendencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Washington sees cooperation with Iran in various Middle East conflicts as a much-needed spin-off from reaching an acceptable agreement with Tehran on its nuclear ambitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The fear in the region is that if Iran cooperates constructively with the US ahead of such an agreement, the US might come under pressure to reward it with a less restrictive nuclear deal.</td></tr>

<h3>Ford's real-life bravado equals Han Solo, Indiana Jones</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>While his fictional adventures in "Star Wars" and as bold archaeologist Jones have thrilled audiences, the star has run into real-life danger - and sometimes pain - while indulging in his love of aviation, fast driving and the unpredictability of filmmaking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Thursday, the actor's vintage plane crash-landed on a golf course in Los Angeles shortly after taking off from a nearby airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ford, 72, who had reported engine failure to air-traffic controllers, was taken to the hospital with injuries that his spokeswoman said were not life-threatening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Beyond joy-riding in the skies, Ford also employs his skills as a pilot, acquired in his mid-50s, to help in search-and-rescue efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>- The scar on his face that lends him a rakish look was earned, he's said, in "a mundane way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In 1964, he was speeding to a job at a department store in Orange County, California, when his car veered off the road and into a telephone pole as he fumbled for his seat belt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>- In 1999, Ford crash-landed his helicopter during a training flight in which he and an instructor were practicing auto rotations in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ford and the instructor were unhurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>- He used his helicopter in 2000 to pluck an Idaho Falls, Idaho, hiker off 11,106-foot Table Mountain in Teton County, Wyoming, and fly her to a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One year later, Ford and another searcher helped find a missing Boy Scout in a forest south of Yellowstone National Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Boy, you sure must have earned a merit badge for this one," Ford told the cold and hungry teenager after whisking him to safety by chopper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>- Ford was at the helm of a Beechcraft Bonanza in 2000 when wind shear forced him to make an emergency landing at Lincoln Municipal Airport in Nebraska.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ford and his passenger were uninjured when the plane clipped the runway and its wing tips were damaged, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>- Ford, who takes pride in doing his own stunt work, reportedly injured his back in 1983 while making "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and damaged ligaments in his leg during production of the 1993 film "The Fugitive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>- Last year, he was filming "Star Wars: Episode VII" in a studio outside London when a door of Solo's Millennium Falcon spacecraft fell and broke the actor's leg, requiring surgery on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He recovered and returned to complete his work on the movie.</td></tr>
