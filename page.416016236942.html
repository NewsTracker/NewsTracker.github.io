<h3>J.B. Holmes wins in playoff at Houston Open</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HOUSTON (AP) - J.B. Holmes used a strong start Sunday for a Houston Open victory in a three-way playoff against Jordan Spieth and Johnson Wagner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>J.B. Holmes wins in playoff at Houston Open HOUSTON (AP) - J.B. Holmes used a strong start Sunday for a Houston Open victory in a three-way playoff against Jordan Spieth and Johnson Wagner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 32-year-old Holmes birdied the first five holes and nine of the first 12 after starting the day six shots back of Jordan Spieth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He had a 64, the day's low round, and won on the second playoff hole for his fourth PGA Tour victory and the $1,188,000 check.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Although Holmes' missed birdie putt had given Wagner another chance, his short putt for par lipped out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I knew I had to play a really low round and I started out great," Holmes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It worked out for me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Spieth, the hottest player on the Tour heading into the Masters, was trying to win his second playoff in three weeks, sandwiched around a runner-up finish in the Texas Open last Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But he bowed out on the first playoff hole after his approach shot landed in a bunker and, lying two, he couldn't get anywhere close to the cup on his chip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wagner, who got into the field only through a sponsor's exemption, admitted being "pretty bummed" by falling short, but said he was hopeful his career is pointed in the right direction again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was trying to become only the second player to get into the Masters on the weekend before, having done it previously by winning Houston in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Holmes' final-day rally was the biggest on the Tour since Matt Jones also came from six down to beat Matt Kuchar in a playoff last April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Houston Open has featured more playoffs than any tournament on the circuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wagner and Holmes hit perfect drives on the first playoff hole - both were on No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>18 - while Spieth almost landed in the water, then wound up buried in the sand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I'm not sure what happened," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I heard something or maybe it was just me. It's not an excuse. I got down in the sand and caught it fat and didn't give myself a chance to continue in the playoff. But it was a great Easter Sunday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Earlier, Spieth had seemingly shot himself out of contention with a poor approach on No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>18, the hardest hole on the course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He wound up with a steep downhill lie and a bunker to clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>However, he chipped within feet, then calmly made the putt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Spieth was trying to become the second-youngest player after Tiger Woods to win a third PGA Tour event before his 22nd birthday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He also could have passed Jimmy Walker, who pulled out of the tournament before it began citing illness, for the current season's points-standing lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Still, Spieth thinks he's well positioned to contend this week in the Masters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He finished second to Bubba Watson last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Spieth earned his first PGA victory before he turned 20, but he's still pursuing a breakthrough in one of the majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Beginning the final round with a single-stroke lead over three players, Spieth didn't make a lot of noise early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Meanwhile, Holmes was shuffling the leaderboard deck, negating a birdie on the third hole with a bogey on the sixth, then stringing together six pars together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But he reclaimed a piece of first place with birdies on 13 and 14, giving his fans, including his parents who had come down from Dallas on Sunday, a jolt of energy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Holmes began the day as an after-thought, tied for 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But he turned the corner having shot a 29, tying the tournament course record for the front nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>His birdie on No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>8 pulled him even with Spieth and another on No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>9, coupled with a Spieth bogey back on six, gave him a lead he wouldn't relinquish before he left the course to await his fate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I've been working on taking it one shot at a time," Holmes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"I did a pretty good job of that today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>When he got to 9 under through only 12 holes, speculation began as to whether he might have a 59 in him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>A bogey on the par-3 16th hole also cost him a shot at breaking the 18-hole course record of 63.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Of the three players tied for second through 54 holes, only Wagner contended Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Scott Piercy, who had tied the tournament course record with a 63 Thursday for the first-round lead, faded gradually and wound up five shots back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Austin Cook, one of four qualifiers to earn spots in the field, got to 15 under through eight holes but struggled with bogeys the rest of the way - including the last three holes - to finish six behind in 11th place in just his second PGA Tour event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson was only a shot off the lead through 36 holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>But he began the day, like Holmes, six strokes back, having shot 75 Saturday with three consecutive closing birdies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Although he birdied the first hole, the tournament's 2011 winner never made a serious move and posted a 71 to wind up in a 17th-place tie, seven shots behind Holmes.</td></tr>
