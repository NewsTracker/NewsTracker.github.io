<h3>Canadian Parliament backs air strikes on Islamic State in Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The House of Commons approved the plan 142-129.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The result was never in doubt, since the ruling Conservatives have a majority in the chamber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The vote also approved the extension of Canada's six-month mission by a year to the end of March 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Canada has around 70 special forces troops in northern Iraq and six Canadian jets are taking part in U.S.-led bombing attacks against Islamic State in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who has made security a main plank of his platform in the run-up to an October election, last week said Canada needed to strike against Islamic State safe havens in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Polls show Harper will have a tough time retaining power in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The New Democrats and the Liberals - the two main opposition parties - say Canadian attacks in Syria will only help prop up President Bashar al-Assad.</td></tr>
