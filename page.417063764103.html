<h3>Egypt executes 6 tried by military court as bombs wound 2</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Egypt executed six men Sunday convicted by a military court over a gunfight last year at a suspected bomb factory, as explosives planted outside of courthouses wounded two people following the death sentence given to ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The six executed men were convicted of killing two military officers in an hourlong battle with police, military and special forces during a raid north of Cairo in March 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Judicial officials said the men also were convicted of belonging to the Sinai-based militant group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, which has since pledged allegiance to the extremist Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Amnesty International had called for a retrial in a civilian court for the men, saying "at least three of the men were held in secret at the time of the crime they have been sentenced for."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egypt has been struggling to contain violence by militants, but the scattered attacks have evolved into a full-fledged insurgency following Morsi's July 2013 ouster by the military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A court sentenced Morsi and over 100 others to death Saturday over a mass prison break during the 2011 uprising that ousted longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Just after Morsi's sentencing, suspected Islamic militants gunned down three judges Saturday in the Sinai Peninsula, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Sunday, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack in its daily English language audio bulletin, claiming it killed six judges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in numbers in the bulletin, which was posted by the SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. firm that monitors jihadis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Meanwhile, officials said a bomb exploded late Saturday outside the main courthouse in the southern city of Assiut, seriously wounding a police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Early Sunday, a bomb wounded a young girl near a courthouse in the Mediterranean city of Port Said, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak to journalists.</td></tr>
