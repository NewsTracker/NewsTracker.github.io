<h3>Potential Dem rivals to Hillary Clinton plug away in Iowa</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - The Hillary Rodham Clinton juggernaut is coming to Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Martin O'Malley already has beaten her to the early-voting state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For months, former Maryland Gov. O'Malley has largely had Iowa to himself as Clinton slow-played her entry into the Democratic race for president in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>O'Malley's Iowa advantage - if there was one at all - should be coming to an end Sunday with Clinton's much-anticipated announcement she's making a second run for the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>O'Malley has done the most to potentially challenge Clinton on the Democratic side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He's visited Iowa six times since the start of last year.</td></tr>
