<h3>UN ignored Ebola warnings and RESISTED declaring public emergency, secret emails reveal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The UN health agency avoided declaring the killer disease as a public health emergency for diplomatic reasons despite warnings from senior staff, an investigation has found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Secret documents obtained by AP show WHO's top bosses were informed of how dire the situation was despite public claims that they had little information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But they held off on declaring an emergency because it could have angered the countries involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Declaring an emergency was "a last resort," Dr Sylvie Briand, who runs WHO's pandemic and epidemic diseases department, said in a June email to a colleague who suggested the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It may be more efficient to use other diplomatic means for now," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Five days after Briand's email, WHO director Dr Margaret Chan was sent a memo that warned cases might soon appear in Mali, Ivory Coast and Guinea Bissau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But it went on to say that declaring an international emergency or even convening a committee to discuss it "could be seen as a hostile act".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Critics and former WHO staff have dismissed the reasoning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That's like saying you don't want to call the fire department because you're afraid the trucks will create a disturbance," said infectious diseases expert Michael Osterholm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The signs this was no ordinary outbreak were there from the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Many were recorded in a memo sent to WHO's Africa director on March 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>En Ebola expert with WHO's Africa office wrote a desperate email to Geneva with disturbing news that many staffers at a leading hospital in Guinea had been exposed to the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"What we see is the tip of an iceberg," Jean-Bosco Ndihokubwayo wrote in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"WE NEED SUPPORT."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Ebola outbreak erupted at a difficult time for the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>WHO was also struggling to contain polio outbreaks - which it had declared an international emergency in May - and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At a June 2 meeting, one senior scientist warned the agency was "overwhelmed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The emergency was eventually declared on August 8, by which point nearly 1,000 people had already died from Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The declaration triggered a global deployment to contain the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama ordered up to 3,000 troops to West Africa and promised to build more than a dozen 100-bed field hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Britain and France also pledged to build Ebola clinics, while China sent a 59-person lab team and Cuba sent more than 400 health workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Former WHO scientist Dr. Matthieu Kamway says it's clear the alarm should have been sounded sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"People died because things were not done," he said.</td></tr>
