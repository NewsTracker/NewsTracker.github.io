<h3>Aust Zunic takes one-shot win in NZ Open</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 22-year-old produced a display of sustained quality with scores of 68 66 66 66 to triumph by one shot at 21-under-par from veteran countryman David Bransdon as Australians swamped the final leaderboard, claiming the top nine spots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bransdon finished with a 64 at The Hills course at Arrowtown, making birdies on eight of his last 10 holes, but his bogey at the 18th cost him plenty as Zunic holed a two-metre birdie putt on the last to avoid a playoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Zunic turned pro despite failing to earn a card at the Australasian tour school and he only got into the NZ Open thanks to a top-10 finish at the New Zealand PGA Championship last week where he was a qualifier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His victory was all the sweeter for his grim experience when involved in a serious car crash while playing as an amateur in the US last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was hospitalised for two months with severe head cuts, a broken elbow and a big loss of blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"When I started playing again, I just felt so grateful to be breathing and out there playing golf. I could have easily died, and that actually helped me play better," Zunic told stuff.co.nz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The first six months there were some medical issues I had to get over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Once I got over them, I feel like it's really built character for me and made me a little wiser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I know it was horrible at the time but I feel like it's made me a stronger person. As my dad always says, everything happens for a reason."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Zunic collected a winner's cheque for $A164,000 and earns a two-year exemption on the Australasian PGA Tour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kristopher Mueck was third, three shots behind Zunic after a 69.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Fellow Australians Cameron Smith (66) and Brad Kennedy (68) tied for fourth, while countrymen Daniel Fox (64), Peter Fowler (66), Scott Arnold (67) and Aaron Pike (71) tied sixth.</td></tr>

<h3>Cyclone Pam: Vanuatu residents collect corpses in wake of monster storm</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Residents attempt to clean up after Cyclone Pam hit and talk about the night the cyclone hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A corpse in the main street, another floating in the harbour, reports of dozens dead elsewhere, and buildings and whole villages blasted into pieces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>These were some of the scenes that greeted dazed Vanuatu residents and tourists on Sunday as the rescue effort and clean-up started in the tiny Pacific island nation which was devastated by Cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The monster category-5 storm, which brought wind gusts of 300km/h, has weakened to a category-3 cyclone as it heads towards New Zealand's North Island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Sunday, the country's National Disaster Management Office reported at least eight people were confirmed dead and 20 had suffered serious injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the death and injury toll was expected to rise as search and rescue efforts ramp up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The first flights bringing outside aid landed at the newly cleared airport near the capital Port Vila about midday on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Unconfirmed reports were circulating of more than 40 people killed in northern Penama province, according to the United Nations Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for the Pacific.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The province is about 120 kilometres from Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Buildings shorn of their roofs in Port Vila, Vanuatu's capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Two foreign nationals were thought to have drowned when their sailing boat sank in the rough seas, but their nationalities have not been confirmed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>Examining the wreckage in Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It looked like some local person had been stranded during the night. Perhaps he'd had too much to drink and had been trying to get back to his home and fallen asleep," said Mr Millman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"And he's been hit by something. They called the ambulance and the police and they came and got the body."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Charter boat operator Australian Peter Phillipps said the body of an unidentified expat had been removed from the harbour in front of his mooring in Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This image shows Cyclone Pam north of New Zealand at 6pm, local time, on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"He was a fellow who had been living on a yacht and got into strife. He got into the tender and was drowned. They found his body in the tender [on Saturday].</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I couldn't tell you where he was from. We used to see him standing on his yacht waving to people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tom Skirrow, country director for Save the Children, said the Vanuatu Government's National Disaster Management Office co-ordinating the emergency response has confirmed the eight deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The victims had been recovered from Port Vila, and its surrounding areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It's without doubt a small number now and it will increase significantly as we start looking around. The problem at the moment is that no one can phone, no one has any communication or any power, so it's very difficult to get accurate numbers," Mr Skirrow said in a phone interview from Port Vila on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Thousands more are believed to be homeless across some of the country's 83 islands after the cyclone's 300km/h gusts were reported to have leveled entire villages.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>Vanuatu Oxfam country director Collett van Rooyen described the moment the cyclone hit in a statement for the charity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Pam arrived announced by the drum roll of our shutters. Then she roared, she squealed, she hissed. She spat and cursed in deep bass tones, and at the same time she whistled and screeched in ways that messed with our senses. What was that we just heard?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Someone outside screaming? The high-pitched string band notes we had heard earlier on the radio?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"No, the radio was off and people had taken shelter. It was Pam in her many voices. She spoke a language of essential fear at its most primitive and we understood it instantly."</td></tr>
