<h3>Greek talks continue after Tsipras rejects creditors' offer - live updates</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There are some wild moves in the financial markets this morning, and Greece is only partly to blame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eurozone bond prices are falling across the board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That follows yesterday's ECB press conference, where Mario Draghi predicted that volatility was here to stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That has prompted traders to pile out of bonds, pushing prices down and driving up yields (the interest rate paid to bondholders).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>German 10-year bonds are now yielding 0.98% -- a sharp jump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That's highest since last September, meaning any trader who piled into Bunds this year is sitting on a loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After an early fall, the euro has now jumped to $1.134.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That's weighing on European stocks, pushing down the German, French, Spanish and Italian markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Greek PM, for now, is holding firm to the idea that any deal must be based on a proposal coming from, not going to, Greece, with a counter offer from the country expected to land at creditors' feet at some point before the end of the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Reports that Tsipras and Juncker will meet again on Friday means things will be left incredibly close to, and maybe actually beyond, the IMF repayment wire [on Friday].</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Yet one questions if any change in attitude, be it from either side, can occur in such a small space of time; if a deal couldn't be found on Wednesday, a shift in tone by Friday seems unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nevertheless, the Eurozone indices are continuing their rollercoaster ride this week, slipping to losses after seeing hope-filled gains yesterday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's all go this morning!</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dow Jones newswires is reporting that the Athens government is planning to make a new counter-offer, having 'converged' with its creditors on some issues last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That may explain why Alexis Tsipras will meet with Juncker on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Greece's Kathimerini newspaper is reporting that Alexis Tsipras will meet Jean-Claude Juncker again on Friday, in another attempt to break the deadlock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greece's Deputy Shipping Minister has warned this morning that the government will not 'surrender' to its creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"What appears to have been discussed and to have been proposed by Mr. Juncker during his meeting with the Greek prime minister is beneath (our) expectations in every way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"If reports are confirmed, obviously we cannot accept them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Good morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Greece's future remains as confused as ever, after Wednesday night's crunch meeting in Brussels between prime minister Alexis Tsipras and EC president Jean-Claude Juncker broke up without a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After speaking for more than four hours, Tsipras emerged after midnight to announce that Greece couldn't accept some of the proposals put together by its creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Instead, he argued, any deal to unlock bailout funds must be based on his own side's offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The meeting wasn't a disaster - according to Tsipras, the two sides are "very close" to agreeing new fiscal targets, after the creditors proposed lower primary surplus goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But there appears to be less consensus on pension reforms and VAT reform, with Greece refusing to roll over and accept a five-page list of proposals created by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>According to the EC, both sides will hold more "intense work" in an attempt to reach a joint position soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But the failure to make a breakthrough last night is still disappointing, with a 305m payment to the IMF due tomorrow, and just 26 days until Greece's bailout programme expires.</td></tr>
