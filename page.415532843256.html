<h3>SXSW: Will Ferrell-Kevin Hart comedy 'Get Hard' divides fest audience</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Before the Will Ferrell-Kevin Hart comedy "Get Hard" was unveiled at SXSW Monday night, the crowd inside the Paramount Theater was in good spirits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ferrell - taking on the attributes of the stiff hedge-funder he plays in the film - walked on stage with an old-school boombox on his shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hart began dancing to the hip-hop music and revving up the audience, telling them how excited he was to be premiering the movie at SXSW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He urged everyone to "jump on Twitter" and spread the word about the film after it was done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"And if you don't like it," he added, "what I want you to do is go out in the middle of the street and kill yourself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I'm not as heavily involved in social media," Ferrell chimed in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"So send me handwritten notes. Hopefully on nice stationary."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Moviegoers stood up and cheered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Everyone was laughing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And then things got awkward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Well, first the movie played.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Get Hard," the March 27 directorial debut of screenwriter Etan Cohen ("Tropic Thunder"), stars Ferrell as James King, a highly uptight man sentenced to a long term in prison for an assortment of financial crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>King has some rather deluded ideas about race and wrongfully assumes that Hart's Darnell, who washes his expensive car, has been behind bars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He asks Darnell for help getting him ready for prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>An assortment of comic set pieces follows, many of the very edgy variety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>(The film was initially given an NC-17 rating before being trimmed to an R.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Part of the training includes preparing Ferrell for the possibility of prison rape, and Darnell takes James to a gay bar with the goal of having him practice oral sex on a stranger - a prospect that James finds so disgusting that he runs out of a bathroom stall after a graphic failed attempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Darnell also tries to make James comfortable with people from all backgrounds, having him hang out with both a gang from South Los Angeles and a white supremacist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He also forces James to say the N-word.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The film evoked a lot of laughter during the screening, but a Q&A with Cohen following the screening turned awkward when an audience member said he found the movie offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>""This film seemed racist as ...," said one questioner, using an expletive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"That's not a question," Cohen replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Soon you will be," Cohen retorted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Were you nervous - and/or how nervous were you - presenting this in front of a live audience being completely, absolutely and unapologetically ... racist and hysterical at the same time?" the questioner finished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Seeming flustered, Cohen admitted the film's tone had been "a really hard delicate balance to find."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"When we were testing this movie, Ferguson was going on," the director said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"So it was a really hard thing to modulate because we wanted to make a real statement about this stuff. We wanted to see just how far we could push it where we could be provocative and people would actually think about this stuff and think about the stereotypes, but not go too far where comedy doesn't deserve to go."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Q&As can often be uncomfortable affairs, particularly when audience questions are involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But this one was especially awkward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Because Ferrell and Hart had come on stage before the movie began, the crowd was also expecting the stars to return post-screening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>One person in line to ask a question noted she "actually had a question for Will."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I'm sorry to be me," Cohen replied apologetically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Once the audience realized the actors would not be participating in the Q&A, dozens started walking out as Cohen was in the middle of answering questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Those who remained pushed him further on the race issue, with one woman asking whether or not Cohen was worried the movie "would be reinforcing racial stereotypes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"When you do satire, that's a big problem," he acknowledged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Because it's sometimes hard to distinguish between satire and what you're satirizing. So that's a dangerous thing."</td></tr>

<h3>Feds: US Air Force Vet Tried to Join Islamic State Group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, of Neptune, New Jersey, was due Wednesday in a New York federal court after being indicted on answer charges of attempting to provide material support to a terrorist group and obstructing justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutors said Pugh had been stopped at a Turkish airport in January carrying a laptop with information on Turkey-Syria border crossing points, 180 jihadist propaganda videos including footage of an Islamic State prisoner beheading, and a letter declaring: "I will use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There is only two possible outcomes for me. Victory or martyr," continued the letter, which authorities believe was to Pugh's Egyptian wife, investigators said in court papers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pugh's lawyer, Michael K. Schneider, said Pugh would plead not guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Schneider declined to comment further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 47-year-old Pugh served in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990 and was trained in installing and maintaining aircraft engines and navigation and weapons systems, according to Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An airman first class, Pugh was assigned to the Woodbridge Air Base in England in July 1987 and Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona in July 1989, the Air Force said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pugh converted to Islam around 1998, court papers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After leaving the Air Force, he worked as an avionics specialist and airplane mechanic for a number of companies in the Middle East and the U.S. - including American Airlines, where the FBI got a 2001 tip about him from a co-worker who said Pugh expressed sympathy for Osama bin Laden, according to court papers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The airline said he left in early 2000 after a few months at American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 2002, an associate of Pugh's told the FBI that Pugh was interested in traveling to Chechnya to wage war, the investigators' court filing said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pugh worked on for DynCorp International in Iraq as an Army contractor in 2009 and 2010, the filing said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>McLean, Virginia-based DynCorp declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Pugh has been living overseas for the past year and a half, most recently in Egypt, investigators said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Last summer, Kuwait-based charter airline Gryphon Airlines considered hiring Pugh for a project but decided he didn't meet the requirements, the company said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He told an acquaintance in a December email that he'd been fired from his most recent job, according to investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Prosecutors said Pugh then decided to join the Islamic State group, traveling from Egypt to Turkey to ultimately cross the border into Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Pugh variously told authorities in Turkey and Egypt that he had gone to Turkey for vacation and to look for a job, and he said had no desire to go to Syria, court papers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But investigators said they found a chart of crossing points between Turkey and Syria, plus information about whether the border checkpoints were staffed, on Pugh's laptop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Investigators said his cellphone also had photos of a machine gun and airplanes, including an airplane bathroom and an area under passenger seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Department of Justice has charged roughly 20 people in the past year with planning to travel to the Middle East to fight alongside militants such as the Islamic State group, which controls parts of Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Federal officials have been concerned about Americans going overseas to train with these groups and returning with plots to carry out attacks at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We will continue to vigorously prosecute extremists, whether based here or abroad, to stop them before they are able to threaten the United States and its allies," Lynch said in a statement Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Three men were arrested late last month in a plot to travel to Syria; they have pleaded not guilty.</td></tr>
