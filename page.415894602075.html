<h3>Obama Administration Releases Military Aid to Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON-President Barack Obama agreed to release to Egypt a dozen F-16 attack aircraft and other military equipment which his administration froze in response to a 2013 military coup, seeking to shore up a longtime alliance with Cairo at a time of growing regional turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The move by Mr. Obama comes as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi appears to be seeking to play a more hands-on role in responding to instability in the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He intervened against militants in neighboring Libya and is now providing military support to a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>U.S. defense officials had also grown increasingly alarmed by signs that Mr. Sisi was reaching out to Russia for military support as the Obama administration continued to debate whether to unfreeze its assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr. Obama told Mr. Sisi about the decision in a Tuesday call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The White House said it would release 12 F-16 aircraft, 20 Harpoon missiles, and up to 125 M1A1 Abrams tank kits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The White House also said it would continue to ask Congress for $1.3 billion a year in annual aid to Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Advocates within the administration and Congress of releasing the frozen military equipment argued that doing so would make it easier for Washington to influence Mr. Sisi's decision-making.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Critics within the administration argued that releasing the equipment would reduce pressure on Mr. Sisi to address U.S. concerns about Egypt's human-rights record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The United States has had a decadeslong strategic relationship with Egypt. Since the August 2013 Egyptian government crackdown, we have made clear our commitment to simultaneously pursuing our security interests and our support for meaningful Egyptian political reform," said spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some of the U.S. military aid was suspended after a 2013 coup led by Mr. Sisi deposed President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Defense Secretary Ash Carter backed the president's decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The decision, a Pentagon official said, had been in the process for weeks and wasn't related to the deteriorating situation in Yemen, where Egypt has backed a Saudi Arabia-led bombing campaign against positions held by the Houthi rebel group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We encourage the government of Egypt to continue its democratic process. But Egypt is also a strong regional ally. Maintaining that relationship must be a priority for the U.S.," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mac Thornberry (R., Tx), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Wondering if they still want it, after just buying $7 Billion in French arms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Unbelievable that Obama dithered this long approving military aid to our ally, Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>ISIS is invading countries across the ME and Obama, the lawya dithers and dithers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>If this had been his favored Muslim Brotherhood, they would have received the military aid over two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Great. We're giving the Egyptians the weapons they need to fight 20th-century wars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Hey, Obama, the Duchy of Grand Fenwick called.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They want their foreign policy back.</td></tr>
