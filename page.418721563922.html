<h3>Volunteer named governor in eastern Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has appointed a well-known volunteer as governor in one of the two war-torn regions in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Since hostilities broke out in eastern Ukraine in April 2014, killing more than 6,400 people, the Ukrainian government has controlled only parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Poroshenko on Wednesday signed the order on live television to appoint 51-year old Heorhiy Tuka, a former telecom executive, as governor of the Luhansk region presenting him as a "man with an immaculate reputation, intolerant to corruption and (who has) Ukraine in his heart."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tuka, known for his efforts helping Ukrainian troops with supplies, is replacing hard-liner Hennadiy Moskal who decreed that civilians were not allowed to travel between rebel-controlled areas and the government-controlled part of the region.</td></tr>
