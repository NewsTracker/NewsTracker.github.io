<h3>US ponders training Iraqi troops to order American air strikes on Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Badr Brigade militia soldier mourns along the Tigris River in Tikrit, Iraq, earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Iraqi government forces continue to locate the corpses of up to 1700 soldiers reportedly executed by IS last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Washington: The United States is considering a novel plan to speed up attacks on Islamic State militants - training Iraqi troops to order American air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq complained during his visit to Washington last week that it had been taking too long for the United States to carry out air strikes on behalf of Iraqi forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Iraq's Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi (L), with US Vice President Joe Biden, appealed for more help in defeating the Islamic State militants in Washington last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But a major constraint to shortening the time to conduct such strikes is that the White House has not authorised troops to accompany Iraqi forces on the battlefield and call in American and allied bombing attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The absence of air controllers is a particular complication for urban battles in which Iraqi forces would be in proximity to their enemy, fighters on both sides would be on the move, and Islamic State units could not always be readily identified by American pilots flying overhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>So the administration is considering whether to train a cadre of Iraqi special forces troops to perform that mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That might include training Iraqi JTACs," the a senior Obama administration official said, using the Pentagon acronym for air controllers who would order air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The use of Iraqi forces in such a role would be a first since US troops went to Iraq in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It would help fill a gap in Iraq's capabilities as it prepares for the fight to reclaim Mosul, the country's second largest city, which is expected later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But one risk is that the Iraqis might misidentify targets, which could lead to the unintentional killing of civilians in American bombing missions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So if the plan goes forward, the US is likely to insist on procedures to confirm the target selection, perhaps by using reconnaissance drones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I'd think we would have to have some eyes on through ISR before we did a strike," the official said, using the abbreviation for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Faced with such challenges, the US may yet opt to send small American teams of air controllers onto the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>General Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said he may recommend that US troops perform such a role when Iraqi forces move to retake Mosul or become involved in other difficult urban fights.</td></tr>
