<h3>US coast guard rescues and tows Australian ship caught in Antartic pack ice</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The American vessel rescued the ship on Saturday and begun towing the 63-meter (207 foot) longliner to open water after freeing it from Antarctic pack ice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to reports, the Chieftain became trapped in ice some 900 nautical miles (1,650 kilometres) north-east of McMurdo Sound after damaging its propeller a week ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Contact: US Coast Guard handout photo shows members of the deck force aboard Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star, uses a bolo to send a messenger line to the crew of the disabled fishing vessel Antarctic Chieftain left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>All 26 crew members on the longliner are not at risk and there has been no oil leak in the environmentally sensitive area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The US coast guard cutter Polar Star was ordered to cross through 720 km of iceberg-strewn waters to the ship's aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to the New Zealand Rescue Coordination Center, which oversees the Southern Ocean search and rescue zone the US ship reached the trawler early on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The New Zealand-flagged trawler Janas is also travelling to the area to provide assistance if required but is not expected to reach the vessels until late Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Open water: The US ship was towing the Australian fishing trawler to open water after freeing it from Antarctic pack ice, rescue authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Americans had earlier deployed a remote-controlled mini-submarine to assess the damage to the Antarctic Chieftain's propeller and gauge if it could travel under its own steam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'The [propeller] blades were assessed as too badly damaged for the vessel to be able to use them for propulsion from the ice field,' Reynecke added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At present the weather conditions are favourable but Polar Star commanding officer Captain Matthew Walker said earlier the ice conditions were 'much more formidable than expected'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Australian Longline, the ship's owners, said that the vessel spent six months at a time in Antarctic waters fishing the prized species, which was also known as 'white gold' for the profits it could yield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Antarctic Chieftain, built in 2002, is licensed to trawl for Patagonian toothfish, a slow-growing species that has a type of anti-freeze in its blood to deal with the punishing southern conditions.</td></tr>

<h3>Islamic State release video showing beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 21 men, all migrant workers hailing from impoverished areas of central Egypt, were kidnapped between late December and early January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fourteen came for the same village, Al-Our.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And it was also announced on Saturday that a second group of 21 Egyptians had been kidnapped in Libya - this time from Misrata.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was not clear why Isil had seized two groups of 21 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Isil claims to have established affiliate groups in three different areas of Libya, a common destination for Egyptian Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The story of Isil's Egyptian hostages is entwined with those of the region's soured revolutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They left Egypt, their families say, for a better life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Four years after the overthrow of long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak, the country's battle-scarred economy offered them little work, and Christian churches and shops in their governorate, Minya, had faced a series of high-profile sectarian attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The journey out of poverty to Libya is one that many have made over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Every year, thousands of Egyptians are lured by the prospect of salaries up to seven times greater than the paltry sums they can command at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi reacted to the killings by saying Egypt reserved the right to respond in a "suitable way and time&#x201d; and would enforce a strict travel ban on travel to Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Sisi's government has faced heavy criticism from the families of the hostages, who say they have seen no concrete attempts to resolve the situation.</td></tr>
