<h3>T-Mobile US calling plans to cover Canada and Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>T-Mobile is now offering its U.S. customers the ability to talk, text and browse the Internet in Canada and Mexico without paying extra charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company points to the large amount of travel done by its U.S. customers in Canada and Mexico, saying that wireless carriers rake in billions of dollars in roaming charges as a result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In addition to travelers, the change could be a big help to U.S. residents who live on the Canadian and Mexican borders and may work or have family on the other side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>T-Mobile US Inc. and other wireless phones do work in Canada in Mexico, but carriers often tack on hefty roaming charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>T-Mobile's change, which goes into effect on Wednesday, also applies to landline customers.</td></tr>
