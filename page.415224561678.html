<tr><td>15</td><td>The 30-year-old pregnant woman ran as fast as she could to escape the Jan. 3 attack on her hometown of Baga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was one of the worst massacres ever carried out by Boko Haram during its five-year insurgency.</td></tr>

<h3>Tsarnaev attorney: 'It was him'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorney made one thing clear during her opening statement in the Boston Marathon bombing trial: He did it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It was him," defense attorney Judy Clarke told jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tsarnaev carried one of the pressure cooker bombs on April 15, 2013, and placed it near the finish line, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was there when a police officer was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was involved in a shootout with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The accused bomber will not sidestep any of his actions, Clarke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>So, why even a trial at all?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Because there's disagreement over why Tsarnaev did it, Clarke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was influenced by his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Clarke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was enlisted by his brother to commit these horrific acts, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The first day of the trial provided jurors with a peek at the strategies of the prosecution and defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Based on their opening statements, both sides agree on the basic facts around the attacks -- who carried them out and how.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But both sides presented divergent views of why Dzhokhar Tsarnaev carried out the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The goal of the Tsarnaev brothers was to kill as many people as possible, U.S. prosecutor Bill Weinreb said during his initial statement to jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The prosecutor described in detail the deaths of three victims near the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon and painted a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as a holy warrior committed to violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>More than 260 others were maimed or injured by two pressure cooker bombs that exploded within 12 seconds of each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Dzhokhar "Jahar" Tsarnaev is on trial in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He has pleaded not guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Elder brother and Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died April 19, 2013, following a shootout with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>His brother tried to free him with a stolen SUV but ran him down instead, according to an indictment against the younger Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev are the parents of the Tsarnaev brothers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The two divorced in 2011, and both now live in the Russian republic of Dagestan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>If Zubeidat Tsarnaev returns to the United States, she could be arrested for failing to resolve shoplifting charges pending against her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has two sisters -- Ailina Tsarnaeva, pictured, and Bella Tsarnaeva.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Ailina was arrested last year and charged with aggravated harassment, accused of making a bomb threat against the mother of her boyfriend's child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She denies the charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Katherine Russell is the widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Her last known apartment was just blocks from the last listed address of Ailina and Bella Tsarnaeva, her sisters-in-law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Ruslan Tsarnaev, the uncle of the Tsarnaev brothers, widely condemned the Boston attack, saying nephew Tamerlan "messed up his life, that's why he decided (to) take lives of innocent people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Dias Kadyrbayev, from left, Robel Phillipos and Azamat Tazhayakov were friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Kadyrbayev pleaded guilty to charges in connection with removing a backpack and computer from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Phillipos was convicted on charges of lying to federal agents investigating the bombing, and a jury found Tazhayakov guilty of obstructing justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly ran from police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed after a gunbattle with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>So it is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who is on trial, charged with 30 counts related to the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Weinreb said Tsarnaev's actions after the bombings -- going to Whole Foods to buy a gallon of milk, hanging out with friends -- show that he didn't care about what he did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>To the contrary, the prosecutor told jurors, he believed he had done good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The motive for the attacks can be found in the boat that ultimately became Tsarnaev's hideout before his arrest, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>There, Tsarnaev allegedly wrote messages explaining that he believed the U.S. government is an enemy of Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Tsarnaev listened to jihadist lectures and songs, and had an online presence in which he espoused a radical view of Islam, Weinreb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>He had a collection of magazines published by al Qaeda, one with instructions for building the same type of bomb used in the Boston Marathon attack, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The defense pinned the radicalization on Tamerlan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Clarke showed two side-by-side photos in court: One of the brothers smiling, and one of them carrying backpacks linked to the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The attacks were "incomprehensible, they're inexcusable," she said, but also asked, who turned Tsarnaev from the smiling kid into a bomber?</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>It was Tamerlan who self-radicalized, and Tamerlan who influenced his brother to follow him, she argued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>At the outset of the trial, Weinreb spoke in detail to the jury about the lives ended by the pair of bombs at the marathon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Martin Richard, an 8-year-old spectator, was standing with his family cheering runners on when the second bomb exploded just feet away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Martin was only 4 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 70 pounds, the prosecutor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The bomb blew large holes into the boy's chest and organs -- "tore large chunks of flesh out of Martin's body," Weinreb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The boy died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The first witness the prosecution called Wednesday was Thomas Grilk, executive director of the Boston Athletic Association.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Grilk provided some facts about the marathon, but Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty also asked him to talk about the day of the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>The prosecution played videos of the first explosion, then the second, showing people scrambling in the aftermath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Grilk let out a long sigh as one of the videos was paused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"Every day you walk outside, you are in that area," testified Shane O'Hara, the manager at Marathon Sports, a running store close to where the bombs went off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>O'Hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair, and cries for help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>The decisions about who to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunt him, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>There were cries, sirens and screams, he said in answer to prosecutors' questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>He sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>He told the jury the plea he heard from one of the injured: "Stay with me, stay with me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Wednesday's testimony centered on the stories of the survivors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers opted not to cross-examine any of the witnesses who testified to what they lived through that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Colton Kilgore and Rebekah Gregory were part of a large group who were present to cheer on a family member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Kilgore took the witness stand and described the videos he shot after the blasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>It was an instinct to record the scene, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>"I was blown through the air. There was a deafening explosion," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>He saw bodies and faces also tumble through the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>His videos captured the chaos, the cries for help, people using any material they could find to help perform first aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>At one point, Kilgore recalled, he sat on something hot, only to realize he was sitting on pieces of burning metal and shards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Gregory testified that she was watching the race, but also looking after her 5-year-old, Noah, who was a bit bored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>"My bones were literally laying next to me on the sidewalk," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>"At that point I thought that was the day I would die."</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Her first instinct was for Noah's safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>She asked God to take her if she was indeed dying, but to let her know that Noah was OK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Noah was injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Gregory now wears a prosthesis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Sydney Corcoran was a high school senior on the day of the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Her testimony centered on her near certainty that she would die that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>She passed out and awoke to a group of men attending to her, putting pressure on her leg, trying to find where she was bleeding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>One man put his forehead on her head and told her she would be OK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>But then, another man said he could see her eyes were going white, she testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>"I could feel my body going tingly and I was getting increasingly cold. I knew I was dying," she told the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>It took nearly two months of juror interviews -- 256 people over 22 court days -- to select the jury in the bombing trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>The group includes 18 people from across the socioeconomic spectrum, but the group is almost exclusively white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Race has been an issue raised by Tsarnaev's defense during four unsuccessful attempts to move the death penalty trial from Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>His attorneys argued that the way the court issues jury summons led to picking a panel that's older and whiter than the community at large.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>But prosecutors argued that the jury had been picked properly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>"The prosecution got exactly what they wanted," said CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos, a criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Middle-aged white jurors tend to be more likely to support death penalty verdicts, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>"It's a target demographic for a death penalty jury."</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Just one juror seemed to combine youth and ethnic diversity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>A college student who is taking a break from his studies, he said his mother was born in Iran and converted from Islam to the Baha'i faith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Will boat be brought to court?</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>The Slip Away, a boat in which Tsarnaev sought cover after the police gunbattle, also is expected to be a key piece of evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>The prosecution is seeking to remove a panel on which Tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so jurors can see it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Weinreb has said the boat is too large to bring into the courthouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>The defense, however, wants the jury to see the entire boat, complete with bullet holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Defense attorney David Bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and wouldn't fairly reflect Tsarnaev's state of mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>"The U.S. government is killing our innocent civilians," he allegedly wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>"We Muslims are one body. You hurt one, you hurt us all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>"Now I don't like killing innocent people. It is forbidden in Islam but due to said (unintelligible) it is allowed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>"Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."</td></tr>
