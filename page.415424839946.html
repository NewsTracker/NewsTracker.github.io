<h3>Ukraine requests UN peacekeeper deployment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A mission would need backing from all five permanent members of the Security Council, however, and Russia - one of those permanent members - is likely to resist the move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Perebiynis said the preliminary request for the mission has been submitted to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and that another would follow after Ukraine's parliament approves the proposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Even if the U.N. does not send a peacekeeping force, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will extend its observer mission to Ukraine for one year, until March 2016, and may double its size to 1,000 observers, an OSCE spokeswoman said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The OSCE monitoring mission to Ukraine was first deployed a year ago, following a request from Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It delivers public reports on fighting between pro-Russian groups and Ukrainians loyal to Kiev as well as on movements across the border between Ukraine and Russia.</td></tr>

<h3>SXSW films offer edgy comedy, genre thrills, Gosling's directing debut</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Equal parts new-talent launching pad, comedy showcase and beer-and-barbecue-fueled party, the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival kicks off its nine-day run in Texas today, as part of the Austin-based extravaganza colloquially known as SXSW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Along with SXSW's music and tech programming, the fest's film component will screen 145 features, more than 100 of which are world premieres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Among the notable selections are three R-rated comedies - Judd Apatow's "Trainwreck," Paul Feig's "Spy" and Etan Cohen's "Get Hard" - continuing SXSW's tradition of foul-mouthed fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Other offerings include documentaries about comedian Russell Brand and the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs; the directorial debut of actor Ryan Gosling, "Lost River"; and the sophomore feature from "A Teacher" helmer Hannah Fidell, "6 Years."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Genre fans will no doubt be interested in Alex Garland's sci-fi thriller "Ex Machina," starring Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson, and George Miller's "Mad Max: Fury Road," the reboot starring Tom Hardy as the post-apocalyptic hero made famous by Mel Gibson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Speaking of nostalgia, the fest also will include a 30th-anniversary restoration of John Hughes' Brat Pack classic "The Breakfast Club."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>To keep up with all the SXSW film news - and the latest from the music and interactive scenes - follow along with The Times' live blog at latimes.com/sxsw.</td></tr>
