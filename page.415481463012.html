<h3>Arrest Made In Connection To Ferguson Police Shooting</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>St. Louis County Police announced on Sunday that they had made an arrest related to the two officers who were shot during a protest on Thursday in Ferguson, Missouri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced that authorities had brought charges, including assault in the first degree, against 20-year-old Jeffrey Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Williams is from the St. Louis area and had been on probation for receiving stolen property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Williams had been involved in protests on the evening that the shooting occurred and had "acknowledged" firing shots, according to McCulloch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>McCulloch said that Williams, who is African-American, may have been firing at someone other than the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But regular demonstrators denied that they had ever seen Williams at the protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After naming three young male protesters who were regularly at the demonstrations, Rice told HuffPost, "I don't think there is a male 20-years-old that regularly protest outside of them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think I can speak for the protester community in saying we don't know him," said Rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After the press conference, press swarmed Alicia Street when she helped source the first picture of Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Street, 29, has been actively involved in protest since August as well and says she was unfamiliar with Williams as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I have never seen him at a protest. I cannot recall that I even seen him that night. We know a lot of people out there, we really do. I even showed pictures to other regular protesters and they said they didn't know him," Street told HuffPost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Other regular demonstrators also said that they did not recognize Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The shooting came during protests after Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced that he would resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>One of the officers was shot in the face and the other was shot in the shoulder, but both survived the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement on Sunday that the arrest was a testament to good collaboration between federal and local authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"This arrest sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated. The swiftness of this action is a credit to the significant cooperation between federal authorities and the St. Louis County Police Department," Holder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The ATF's ballistic imaging technology has played a critical role in the ongoing investigation. I commend both the ATF and St. Louis police for their tremendous work in identifying this suspect."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>President Barack Obama condemned the shooting on Thursday, posting on Twitter that "violence against police is unacceptable."</td></tr>
