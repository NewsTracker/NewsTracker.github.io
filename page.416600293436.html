<h3>Bali nine executions: Indonesia responds to Australia withdrawing ambassador</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announce the withdrawal of Australia's ambassador to Indonesia following the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Indonesia has indicated it is not concerned about the Australian government's decision to recall its ambassador from Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Foreign Minister Retno said Indonesia did not need to be too worried about the recall of the Australian ambassador because both countries had a mutual need of each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi says Australia withdrawing its ambassador is within the rights of the nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The recall of ambassador, the summons of ambassador for consultations is the right of the sending country, in this case it is the right of Australia," Ms Marsudi told MetroTVnews.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Australian embassy had yet to officially communicate the recall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Every time we communicate with Australia we always emphasise Indonesia's interest in continuing to having a good relationship. Australia is an important partner for Indonesia and I think, Indonesia is an important partner for Australia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran has led to the withdrawal of Australia's ambassador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the unprecedented move to withdraw Australia's ambassador Paul Grigson during a press conference in Canberra on Wednesday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"These executions are both cruel and unnecessary," Mr Abbott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We respect Indonesia's sovereignty but we do deplore what's been done and this cannot be simply business as usual. For that reason, once all the courtesies have been extended to the Chan and Sukumaran families, our ambassador will be withdrawn for consultations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Indonesian President Joko Widodo said the withdrawal of the Australian ambassador will not affect the use of the death penalty in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This is about our legal sovereignty," he told local media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Responding to Mr Abbott's comments that executions are "cruel" and "unnecessary", Mr Joko said they had been done in line with the existing regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Australia has not withdrawn ambassadors when other Australian citizens have been subjected to the death penalty, including when convicted Australian drug smuggler Van Tuong Nguyen was executed in Singapore in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo said Brazil and the Netherlands had also recalled their ambassador after the January 18 executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Six people were killed by firing squad in Indonesia in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The group, from the Netherlands, Brazil, Vietnam, Malawi, Nigeria and Indonesia, were the first to be executed under Mr Joko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said once the Bali nine pair had exhausted all their legal avenues they had to carry out the death sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Joko also stressed that the death penalty for drug kingpins was the legal system that existed in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He asked other countries to respect Indonesia in the way Indonesia respected other countries' legal systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Joko said that Filipina maid Veloso's execution had been postponed, not cancelled, due to the emergence of new evidence after her recruiter surrendered to the Filipino police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He denied the Philippine government had lobbied him in the lead up to the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said it was too early to talk about the third batch of executions to be held in Indonesia this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"There are two aspects of an execution, technical and judicial, and we have to prioritise the judicial aspect first," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He said the second round of executions had been carried out better than the first and an area to prepare the bodies after death had been added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"It was carried out as humanely possible," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I hope these executions will serve as a warning to the others thinking of trying to commit narcotic crimes to rethink."</td></tr>
