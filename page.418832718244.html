<h3>Baltimore Ravens owner denies pressuring Roger Goodell on Deflategate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I have not and will not put any pressure on the Commissioner or anyone representing the NFL office to take action in what everyone is calling 'Deflategate,'" Bisciotti said in the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Let's talk about football and the start of training camps. Fans and people like me want the issue resolved now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Friday, ESPN Sal Paolantonio said Bisciotti, Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay and other AFC owners have been lobbying Goodell to uphold the four-game suspension of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I know who they are and I'm gonna name 'em right now," Paolantonio told the Mighty 1090 in San Diego on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Jim Irsay of the Colts. Steve Bisciotti of the Ravens and others in the AFC who believe the Patriots have gotten away with murder for years and have not been publicly punished properly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Goodell said last week there is no timeline for a ruling in the appeal of Brady's four-game suspension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Speaking at a fundraiser in Pennsylvania, Goodell said, "We will make a decision as quickly as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Brady appealed the suspension on June 23 at NFL headquarters in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Goodell said the league is being very thorough to consider all aspects of the appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The NFL Players Association and Brady's camp are planning to move their litigation to federal court if Goodell doesn't wipe out the ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The investigation began after the AFC Championship game when 11 of 12 game balls tested at halftime of the Patriots' win over the Colts were found to be below PSI minimums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>NFL investigator Ted Wells found that it was "more probable than not" that Brady was aware of the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kraft, who chose not to fight team penalties -- a $1 million fine and two draft picks docked -- sent Goodell a signed affidavit supporting Brady for the June appeal.</td></tr>
