<h3>Bryan Cranston Finds Donald Trump?s Behavior ?Refreshing?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bryan Cranston may not actually be a Donald Trump supporter, but he does find the 2016 Republican frontrunner to be "refreshing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Breaking Bad actor shared his thoughts about the presidential candidate on the Nerdist podcast this week, explaining, "There's something so refreshing about shaking up that world that is all about being handled, and here comes this loose cannon who has terrible ideas and would be a horrible president, but there's something great about his 'I-don't-give-a-sh-t' attitude that really kind of keeps others honest."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Trump's often provocative statements have indeed forced his fellow candidates to clarify their positions on controversial issues, from immigration to the treatment of women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think it's a surprise benefit to the country, actually," Cranston said.</td></tr>
