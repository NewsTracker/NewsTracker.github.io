<h3>Google wants to count the calories in your Instagram food porn photos</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>INSTAGRAM photos could become a quick way to count your calorie intake, thanks to Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The search giant is reportedly working on a service with the ability to analyse the content of photos and estimate a calorie count.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dubbed Im2Calories, it is believed the service will implement technology created by DeepMind - an artificial intelligence startup bought by Google last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Im2Calories is expected to work out the size of portions in relation to the plate and is expected to identify condiments and ingredients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It doesn't matter if the photograph of the food is high quality or not, according a report on the science-fiction-esque technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google research scientist Kevin Murphy made reference to the Im2Calories project last month at the Rework Deep Learning Summit, in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"To me it's obvious that people really want this and this is really useful," he told the conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Ok fine, maybe we get the calories off by 20 percent. It doesn't matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We're going to average over a week or a month or a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"And now we can start to potentially join information from multiple people and start to do population level statistics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Google has filed a patent which appears to reference the Im2Calories technology research, reports Popular Science.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If we can do this for food, that's just the killer app," Mr Murphy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Suppose we did street scene analysis. We don't want to just say there are cars in this intersection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We want to do things like localise cars, count the cars, get attributes of the cars, which way are they facing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Then we can do things like traffic scene analysis, predict where the most likely parking spot is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"And since this is all learned from data, the technology is the same, you just change the data."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Google recently launched a slew of new products and services during its annual developer conference, Google I/O.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Im2Calories was not one of the announcements made at the event.</td></tr>
