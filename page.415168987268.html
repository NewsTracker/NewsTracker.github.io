<h3>Netanyahu to use Congress' bully pulpit to assail Iran talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Netanyahu is seizing the high-profile bully pulpit of the U.S. House to deliver his stern message about the dangers of a nuclear deal that President Barack Obama and U.S. allies might sign with Israel's archenemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seizing the bully pulpit of Congress to warn against trusting Iran to curb its nuclear ambitions, even as President Barack Obama's negotiators continue talking with the Iranians Tuesday in hopes of closing a deal this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu insists he is privy to emerging details of a potential agreement and is expected to lay out his specific concerns in Tuesday's speech to a joint meeting of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Obama administration has complained that congressional Republicans injected destructive partisanship into the U.S.-Israel alliance by inviting Netanyahu to speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the White House played down the controversy in the hours before the address in the House chamber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett called it "a bit of a distraction" but told MSNBC the dispute wouldn't undermine Obama's commitment to Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We share a common goal of ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons," Jarrett said, and disagree with Netanyahu only over "the tactics of how to get there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Netanyahu says he means no disrespect to Obama but is morally obliged to warn against any deal that might leave open the way to a nuclear-armed Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The speech comes just two weeks ahead of a tight national election in which Netanyahu is fighting to hold onto his job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Obama does not plan to meet with Netanyahu while he's in Washington, saying he wants to avoid any perception that he is meddling in Israel's election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a warm-up address to America's leading pro-Israel lobby on Monday, Netanyahu said he would speak to Congress "about an Iranian regime that is threatening to destroy Israel, that's devouring country after country in the Middle East, that's exporting terror throughout the world and that is developing, as we speak, the capacity to make nuclear weapons - lots of them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Israeli leader is deeply suspicious of international efforts to reach a nuclear deal, fearing the U.S. and its negotiating partners will give Iran too many concessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That puts him on a collision course with Obama, who has put his prestige on the line to pursue a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The U.S. and Iranian sides met for two hours on Tuesday morning in the Swiss resort of Montreux, according to U.S. officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They likely will continue meeting through Netanyahu's speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Both sides said they were making progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We're working away, productively," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Netanyahu believes that preventing a nuclear-armed Iran would be his crowning achievement - and that a bad deal would be a setback and far worse than no deal at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>While powerful, his speech to Congress also might sound a note of desperation as he appears almost out of options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>As many as 40 members of the House and more than a handful of senators are expected to skip the speech, which many have labeled a partisan political stunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Vice President Joe Biden, president of the Senate, also won't be there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He's on a trip to Central America and his seat on the dais will be filled by Sen. Orrin Hatch, president pro tempore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Many Democrats will be in the audience, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he would attend "to find out more about the prime minister's point of view on this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Hatch, R-Utah, said Monday that Congress should complement the prime minister's address with the threat of more sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I am deeply troubled that our president's solution won't work," Hatch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"This administration has opted for a policy of conciliation that does nothing to curb this growing threat. And all the while, the threat to Israel grows stronger every day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Netanyahu expressed frustration that his speech has created such controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He insisted that his speech to Congress was not meant to show any disrespect toward Obama or the Oval Office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He also said it was not intended to "inject Israel into the American partisan debate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Members of Congress who are expected to be no-shows at the speech blame House Speaker John Boehner for inviting Netanyahu without consulting with the White House or congressional Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice has said the speech is destructive to the fabric of U.S.-Israeli relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Kerry has said Netanyahu should hold his criticism until he knows the details about a deal - if one materializes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Kerry said Monday in Geneva that negotiators are seeking a verifiable set of commitments that its nuclear program is peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He said that "any deal must close every potential pathway that Iran has towards fissile material, whether it's uranium, plutonium, or a covert path. The fact is only a good, comprehensive deal in the end can actually check off all of those boxes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Kerry is meeting this week with Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif.</td></tr>

<h3>Venture capitalist to take stand in Silicon Valley lawsuit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A jury is set to hear opening arguments this week in a multimillion-dollar sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Pao, currently interim chief of the news and social media site Reddit, against the prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Ellen Pao, center, with her attorney, Therese Lawless, left, leaves the Civic Center Courthouse during a lunch break in her trial Tuesday, Feb. 24, 2015, in San Francisco.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A legendary billionaire investor defended his Silicon Valley venture capital firm Tuesday while testifying in a high-profile sex discrimination lawsuit that has accused the firm of being an all-boys club where women were denied chances to advance and treated as second-class citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield, Byers, took the stand in San Francisco Superior Court in the lawsuit brought by his former chief of staff, Ellen Pao, who says she was denied a promotion at the company because she is a woman and was fired in 2012 after she complained and filed her lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The case has sparked debate over the treatment of women in the high-tech and venture capital fields, which are dominated by men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I don't consider Kleiner Perkins to be a firm run by men," Doerr said under questioning by Pao's attorney, Alan Exelrod.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have many female partners."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Doerr is among the most prominent venture capitalists in Silicon Valley in part for helping direct early investments in Amazon and Google after joining Kleiner Perkins in 1980.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He sits on Google's board and served on boards that advised President Barack Obama about economic policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His net worth is estimated at $3.5 billion by Forbes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Doerr appeared exasperated at times during hours of questioning by Exelrod, averting his gaze and shifting in his seat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Exelrod has argued Kleiner Perkins had a male-dominated culture where his client received a book of erotic poetry from a male senior partner and experienced retaliation by a male colleague after she broke off an affair with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Asked about the book of poetry, Doerr said Pao did not tell him the nature of the book during a 2007 meeting and did not seem upset by it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She was emphatic that her affair with the male colleague was in the past and not a problem, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Doerr said he did not recall telling an investigator that Kleiner Perkins was run by men and that Pao had a "female chip" on her shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The investigator had been brought in by the firm and looked into Pao's complaint alleging gender discrimination and a complaint filed by a female employee who claimed she was sexually harassed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The investigator alleged that Doerr had made those statements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Pao initially worked as Doerr's chief of staff, writing his letters and speeches, among other duties, before becoming a junior partner in 2010 with full-time investment duties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The firm has denied wrongdoing and says Pao, 45, didn't get along with her colleagues - a requirement for the junior partner position - and performed poorly in that role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In a job review presented in court Tuesday, Doerr said Pao needed to improve her interpersonal skills and not be dismissive of peers who don't meet her expectations, though he otherwise praised her performance in her first year as his chief of staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"People need to be able to confront disagreements on ideas and then agree and pull together as a team," Doerr said under questioning by Kleiner Perkins attorney Lynne Hermle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Ellen lacked those skills."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Venture capital firms, which provide much of the startup funds for tech companies, have a reputation as being even more insular and male-dominated than the companies they help launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Women hold 15 to 20 percent of the technology jobs at tech giants Google, Apple, Facebook and Yahoo, according to disclosures by the companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Venture capital firms are even more slanted toward men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A study released last year by Babson College in Massachusetts found that women filled just 6 percent of the partner-level positions at 139 venture capital firms in 2013, down from 10 percent in 1999.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>During questioning by Hermle, Doerr said he tried to increase the number of women in venture capital and the technology sector, including recruiting women and backing companies run by women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Almost always, women are better leaders than men," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Pao is seeking $16 million in damages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The firm is seeking to limit any possible damages by arguing that Pao is well-compensated in her current position as interim CEO of the popular social media company Reddit and hasn't suffered financially since leaving Kleiner after filing her lawsuit.</td></tr>
