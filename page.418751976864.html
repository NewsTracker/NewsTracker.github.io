<h3>Hillary Clinton addresses U.S. racism problem in S.C.</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton declared that "black lives matter" in South Carolina Thursday, as she repeatedly stressed that endemic racism must be tackled by government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"This is not just a slogan, this should be a guiding principle," she told a gathering of 400 local Democrats, many of them mayors and many of them African-American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have to also acknowledge we have some serious problems with race and justice and systemic racism which unfortunately is all too often present."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clinton argued that America has improved in its race relations - but not enough - and drew an implicit contrast with primary rival and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has focused on class inequality much more than racial inequality in his campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Anyone who says we don't have to make any more progress is blind to what we need to do to deal with race and justice questions," she declared to cheers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I also believe that economic inequality is a symptom of racism, it is not the only reason for racism. Racism is much deeper."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The comments represent a ramping up of her focus on racial issues as the national conversation has become increasingly focused on police brutality against African-Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton made a point to highlight the "heartbreaking" death of Sandra Bland, a black woman who recently died in police custody in Texas after getting pulled over for not using her signal to change lanes while driving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The challenge of systemic racism is far from finished. Every day you see schools and neighborhoods that are segregated," she said, pointing out disparities in education, housing access, infant mortality rates and a "far from balanced" criminal justice system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She later returned to the point after being asked what needs to be changed in the justice system, arguing that there are "undeniable racial disparities" in how white and black men are treated when they are stopped by police, arrested, charged, convicted or sentenced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clinton has been focusing heavily on issues of racial inequality, which have been a big part of the national conversation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Her approach to the issue could have a big impact on whether she can turn out African-Americans near the numbers that President Obama did in his historic race and make a difference in some key swing states in the general election.</td></tr>
