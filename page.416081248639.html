<h3>Let's review the reviews of Apple Watch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hearing a lot of talk about Apple Watch Wednesday?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That's because the tech press has finally released their reviews of the anticipated smartwatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Let's review the reviews of Apple Watch Hearing a lot of talk about Apple Watch Wednesday?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There seems to be some consensus on a few ideas, such as the Apple Watch's high learning curve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Here's another common refrain: the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch in the market, but not necessarily something you need.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"As with most first-time products, it isn't flawless or essential. But among smartwatches, Apple Watch is second to none. I want one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The first Apple Watch may not be for you - but someday soon, it will change your world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The body is bound to get thinner; the edges could stand to be less rounded. It isn't just the aesthetics, either. Soon, we won't have to charge the battery every night, the software won't ever get stuttery and those health sensors will get even more accurate. When was the last time Apple didn't improve first-gen hardware's performance while making it sleeker? The Apple Watch makes you look good. But the next one is bound to make you look even better."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There's no question that the Apple Watch is the most capable smartwatch available today. It is one of the most ambitious products I've ever seen; it wants to do and change so much about how we interact with technology. But that ambition robs it of focus: it can do tiny bits of everything, instead of a few things extraordinarily well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Apple Watch does as much, maybe more, than competing smartwatches, but it doesn't demand that you pay attention to it. It also succeeded in its most important task: Getting me to keep my iPhone in my pocket. That's a pretty impressive feat."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The watch is not life-changing. It is, however, excellent. Apple will sell millions of these devices, and many people will love and obsess over them."</td></tr>
