<h3>Egypt investigates explicit video filmed near Giza pyramids</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt is investigating how foreign tourists managed to film a pornographic video near the Giza pyramids, the government said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 10-minute video was posted online last year, local newspaper Al Masry Al Youm said, but the incident only gained wide attention this week when the paper published a story about it with screenshots that blurred out a woman's breasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The privately owned paper said the video showed nudity and sex acts by Russian-speaking tourists near the 4,500 year-old Giza pyramids and the Sphinx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There is unlawful footage of pornographic scenes in the area of the pyramids made by a foreign female tourist," antiquities minister Mamdouh al-Damaty said in a statement, adding that he had referred the issue to the public prosecutor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The filming has prompted some strongly adverse online comment in the conservative Muslim country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tourism is a main source of revenue and foreign currency for Egypt, but four years of political turmoil since the Arab Spring uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak has scared away most foreign tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The government said it would take at least two more years before tourism returns to pre-2011 levels.</td></tr>
