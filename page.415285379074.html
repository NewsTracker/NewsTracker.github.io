<h3>Egypt investigates explicit video filmed near Giza pyramids</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt is investigating how foreign tourists managed to film a pornographic video near the Giza pyramids, the government said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 10-minute video was posted online last year, local newspaper Al Masry Al Youm said, but the incident only gained wide attention this week when the paper published a story about it with screenshots that blurred out a woman's breasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The privately owned paper said the video showed nudity and sex acts by Russian-speaking tourists near the 4,500 year-old Giza pyramids and the Sphinx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There is unlawful footage of pornographic scenes in the area of the pyramids made by a foreign female tourist," antiquities minister Mamdouh al-Damaty said in a statement, adding that he had referred the issue to the public prosecutor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The filming has prompted some strongly adverse online comment in the conservative Muslim country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tourism is a main source of revenue and foreign currency for Egypt, but four years of political turmoil since the Arab Spring uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak has scared away most foreign tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The government said it would take at least two more years before tourism returns to pre-2011 levels.</td></tr>

<h3>Obama lauds racial progress on Selma anniversary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SELMA: With a nod to ongoing US racial tension and attempts to limit voting rights, President Barack Obama declared the work of the Civil Rights Movement advanced but unfinished on Saturday on a visit to the Alabama bridge that spawned a landmark voting law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Obama, the first black US president, said discrimination revealed in a report about law enforcement practices in Ferguson, Missouri, this week showed a lot of work needed to be done on race in America, but he warned it was wrong to suggest that progress had not been made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished, but we're getting closer," Obama said, standing near the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where police and state troopers beat and used tear gas against peaceful marchers who were advocating against racial discrimination at the voting booth.</td></tr>
