<h3>Facebook's bite into TV</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The world's biggest social service has the potential to generate US$3.8 billion in revenue from video advertising by 2017, triple its expected haul this year, according to a Wall Street research firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook, with 1.39 billion average monthly active users worldwide as of the end of 2014, can boost video ad sales "with only modest cannibalization of other ad revenue sources," Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente wrote in a research note Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Based on the firm's revised estimates, it raised its target price on the stock from $90 to $96 per share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At the same time, Facebook will not punch a hole in YouTube's battleship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Google-owned video service is set to more than double its revenue over a three-year span, according to Nomura's projections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>YouTube generated revenue of $4.1 billion in 2014, and that will grow to $8.5 billion by 2017, per the firm's estimates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With the overall online-video advertising pie growing, the implication is that those ad dollars will flow from other areas -- primarily TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"In our view, Facebook and YouTube will likely be the largest players in online video, providing differentiated offerings with respect to pricing, targeting and engagement," DiClemente wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>By 2017, Facebook and YouTube's combined share of global online video spending will increase to 36% (from 34% in 2014).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The analyst firm estimated that Facebook's video ads carry a cost per thousand (CPM) in the range of $22-$28, in line with other premium digital-video inventory and prime-time broadcast TV, whereas YouTube's CPMs average $15-$20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"In contrast to YouTube, because users are logged into Facebook's service while viewing their newsfeed, Facebook can leverage all of a user's data to offer advertisers unmatched targeting at scale," DiClemente said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On the other hand, YouTube likely has far better completion rates for video ads than Facebook, given that audiences are visiting YouTube expressly for the purpose of viewing video content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Moreover, DiClemente noted, "YouTube audiences are more likely to be watching ads with sound, again due to users' intention of watching video content," whereas Facebook video ads autoplay in its users' feeds with the audio muted by default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the past two months, Facebook has inked deals to bring premium video to the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Those include pacts with MSNBC for a pair of daily Web series; ABC to live-stream "The Oscars Backstage"; and "Access Hollywood" for a behind-the-scenes daily show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, on the company's earnings call in January, said that "what really matters is that consumers are using video on Facebook... We're already seeing pretty explosive growth without that kind of premium content in the system in large numbers, and so we'll continue to figure (that) out."</td></tr>

<h3>Rangers host Blackhawks aiming for sixth straight win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Talbot and the Rangers shoot for a sixth victory in a row on Wednesday night when they take on the Chicago Blackhawks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lundqvist has not played since Feb. 2 versus Florida, a start that came two days after he was hit in the throat by a puck in a game against Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He finished out that contest and played the full 60 minutes against the Panthers before being shut down due to a vascular injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lundqvist is 25-11-3 with a 2.25 goals against average, .922 save percentage and five shutouts in 39 starts this season, but the Rangers have hardly felt his loss as Talbot has gone 13-2-3 since Lundqvist's injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Talbot is 17-6-4 with a 2.19 GAA, .926 save percentage and five shutouts in 29 games (27 starts) on the season and has yielded one goal or fewer in five of his past six outings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>New York has needed his stellar play as it has just 10 goals over a five-game winning streak, getting tallies from James Sheppard and Matt Hunwick in Sunday's 2-1 win over the Panthers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hunwick snapped a 93-game goal drought and Sheppard got his first goal with the Rangers since being acquired from San Jose on March 1, while Talbot came up with 38 saves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We were very fortunate that our goaltender was on top of his game," said Rangers coach Alain Vigneault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>New York improved to 14-1-2 over its past 17 games and is five points ahead of the New York Islanders for first place in the Metropolitan Division with an NHL high-tying 95 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Though Lundqvist appears close to returning, the Rangers did lose forward Martin St. Louis for the next 10-to-14 days because of a lower-body injury sustained versus the Panthers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 68 games this season, the 39-year-old has registered 20 goals and 27 assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The loss of St. Louis could put more pressure on Talbot, who has won both of his career starts versus the Blackhawks while giving up only one goal on 61 shots faced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He posted a 29-save shutout in a 1-0 overtime win at Chicago on March 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Derick Brassard scored 32 seconds into overtime as the Rangers topped the Blackhawks for a third straight time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They also have won five of the past seven encounters at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Corey Crawford ended with 35 saves for the Blackhawks, falling to 1-2-1 with a 2.03 GAA and .931 save percentage in four career meetings with the Blueshirts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Chicago is aiming for a fourth win in a row and helped the Rangers' chances at a division title with last night's 4-1 win over the New York Islanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Jonathan Toews led the way with four points off a pair of goals and two assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Marian Hossa also scored and Patrick Sharp notched a pair of helpers one game after breaking out with two goals in a win over San Jose on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We were making plays," said Toews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I think Hossa and I fed off of Sharp's momentum from the last game."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Crawford made 38 saves to extend Chicago's point streak to six games in a row (5-0-1).</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The 'Hawks are four points back of the second-place Nashville Predators in the Central Division and are five ahead of Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Blackhawks begin a four-game road trip and it is unknown if Crawford will get the start again tonight or if backup Scott Darling will make his first appearance since Feb. 27.</td></tr>
