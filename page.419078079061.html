<h3>Facebook lets businesses message users privately</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A sign with Facebook's "Like" logo is posted at Facebook headquarters near the office for the company's User Operations Safety Team in Menlo Park, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>If users post a comment on a business's Facebook page, then the business can now privately message that person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook Inc rolled out features Wednesday that enable businesses to privately communicate with customers through messages as part of the social networking company's push to make its Messenger app a stand-alone platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Businesses can now include a "send message" button in ads that appear in Newsfeed that allow Facebook users to click a button and send messages, which are private.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If users post a comment on a business' Facebook page, then the business can privately message that person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The features are part of Facebook's efforts to convince more small and medium-sized businesses - especially those in emerging markets, such as India, Brazil and Indonesia - to advertise on its platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By giving them direct access to customers, the world's largest social network hopes to show that advertising on Facebook directly leads to increased sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>To encourage quick responses, Facebook will award "very responsive to messages" badges on business pages that respond to 90 per cent of messages and respond on average within five minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>People will, however, still be able to block private messages from businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The features will be especially valuable in southeast Asia, Facebook wrote in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>About twice as many Thai and Singaporean users use Facebook messages to communicate with businesses each month and most Southeast Asia users follow some company pages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Facebook hosts more than 40 million active small and medium business pages, it said, with more than 1 billion page visits each month.</td></tr>
