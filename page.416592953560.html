<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A city on edge the National Guard meeting calmer crowds on the streets of west Baltimore today that city now under a state of emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>I'm Caroline Costello in New York right now Baltimore police updating the situation in their city let's listen in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>We're deploying to critical infrastructure sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Locations that have experienced previous incidents of lawlessness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And areas where investigative efforts tell us we need to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>We will respond quickly and efficiently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>To incidents that take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But again we are hoping that we don't see any of those today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>We know that a minimum of one of our officers have been injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>During the course of the lawlessness that took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>We expect that the number might be a little bit higher but we've had reports that our officers sustained minor injuries did not want to come off the line did not want to go seek medical treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They wanted to stay with the or other law enforcement officers continue to help protect the city of Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>We know that there were a 140 Ford vehicle fires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And we know that there's one person who is in critical condition as a result of a structure fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I would refer you to the fire department to give you total number of fires that took place last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Right now there is a large crowd at north avenue Pennsylvania Avenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That crowd is peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And that's what we're used to seeing in malls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Zero people that come together peacefully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To express their concern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>To voice their frustrations and to do soda peaceful manner and we hope that that's what we continue to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Owner remind everyone that we have a 10 o'clock curfew this evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>And that is an effect of 5 o'clock tomorrow morning we will be enforcing the curfew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I think it's very appropriate right now to thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>All the people in the community we received emails text messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Messages on our social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Up from people across the country across the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In the city we've had people bringing our officers food and water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>As around various neighborhoods we want to thank you for that we're very thankful for the for the still support from our community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>And I think everyone in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It is looking for its news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>So he's returning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>And again we want to send our thanks to our regional partners of the national guard's everyone that's in the city right now helping people save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The battle takes lessons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>And so the officers say that there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Provided they're higher up than they needed more help after the violent Saturday night live with our help here before yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>You know I think that there's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>This is clearly what people want to talk about I think that it's important that a degree of context.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>When we deployed our officers yesterday we're deploying for a high school that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>I don't think that there's anyone in the country I would expect us to the boys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Automatic weapons and armored vehicles to an event was thirteen fourteen and fifteen year olds that's not what people expect from their police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>What we saw that turn into yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Was an incident that escalated in violence in the aids could be the people involved increases well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>So as of today with our 235.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Arrests we know that 34 of them are juvenile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>And 201 were adults so clearly the dynamic of that situation changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>You saws adapt our techniques throughout the day yesterday to address that situation to address that concern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>And where we are today we'll we've called in support from all of our regional partners and we have that's where more deployment right now you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>There. I what I can tell you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Is that we have officers that are deployed to our hot spots that we have our regional partners and the National Guard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>And strategic locations in critical infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>That we have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>The ability to respond quickly to incidents of lawlessness that take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>And again when it's about creating concepts one of the questions that we've got.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>There's been this comparison to other locations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>In other locations the incidence of it contains one area what we saw last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Was a group of people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Take advantage of a situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Of a very unfortunate situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>And use that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>To tear down their own neighborhoods to destroy the businesses in their own communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>And that's that that's a different dynamic than and other places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>So our deployment today is to be able to respond to those sorts of incidents like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>How seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>You know I think any drug that comes in right now he bit of information is going to be examined for its credibility hurts grass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>You investigative work you know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>We we put up that these other day that we at a rest of the individual who would sort of you start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Much like that we're going to do investigative worker we have detectives right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>But available through videotapes of the people delegates to lawless activity last night and we're gonna find those people and arrest them Wolfson going to be looking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Future incidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>The police commissioner is in the watch senator right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Commanding the resources that are on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>And directing our response to incidents but again right now and what I want to sit over very thankful for is that we have a large group north avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>That they're peaceful that's the Baltimore that we're used to seeing gusts Baltimore that we hope to continue to see throughout the rest of tonight it's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>So we know that her views of the bags on ten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Mugs on a bug and I told Bob o'clock in the morning so unless he gave some workers are under way to receive medical treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>You're not allowed to be out obviously that's going to be enforcement and we have a tremendous number of resources throughout the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>And we will enforce that curfew to make sure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>That our city stays safe throughout the night so we don't have essential to business and places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>You know I don't I don't want to get into a very specific situations I want to speculate about what that looks like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>You can come up with a hundred different situations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Degree of common sense at all we're gonna employ but at the same time this is about me into the city say there's at 10 o'clock curfew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>We have repeatedly put out that there's a 10 o'clock curfew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>So we're we're telling people to please stay off the streets after 10 o'clock Lester under way to receive other medical treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Where you're coming from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>So what you've obviously received a large number of calls for service warning to get to all those calls was that was going to investigate the incidents of crime that took place at city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>I think one of the things that we want to make clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>This. We have an obligation to protect life Saarloos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Sign behind we have an obligation to protect life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>I expect to live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>By making sure that our citizens are safe and that our offices are save that is how we moved to protect property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>That is how we need to prevent other acts of lawlessness taking place so we'll get to those calls for service we will absolutely investigate criminal acts that took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Com we'll do everything that we tend to make sure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>That were putting resources in the right place right time fifth independently of us here just.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>So I know that this morning we've made a total of I think what we have right now is about a dozen arrests we'll get more from numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Ford looks right now like seven adults and five children are up five juveniles that were arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>We'll get the specifics on instance of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>We're gonna investigate reports of of criminal activity as it takes place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>I think it's very important not to lump all of the complexity that takes place in the city into one that this is all connected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>We're going to look at the incidents as they are and the response them as a comment there we will be doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Happening right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Give me 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>We're going to be we're gonna make every effort to do hourly briefings from now until at least 9 o'clock tonight so that we continue to update you with information as were able to get it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>Does and how we'll look into that it would have been more on that all of that out thank you all very while.</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>And we have been listening to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>An update from Baltimore police after a night of vandalism and fires and violence and looting he Baltimore police department taking a little bit of criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>As some officers reportedly claiming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>That. There were not enough reinforcements sent out quickly enough not enough officers out there prepared to handle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>The rioting that we saw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>The police captain defending the department saying that they were prepared to handle a high school event with 141516.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>Year olds and there was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>No reason to believe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>That. You know automatic weapons and Ryan each year.</td></tr>

<tr><td>116</td><td>Ray Kelly Rea thank you so much for sharing your insight tensions running high last night in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>How things get so violent so fast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>Well I and that's a good question obviously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>Things happened spontaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>I think the police units stamped up to respond to an emergency other you could argue that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>Because of things that happened though over the weekend that maybe they they should have that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>But it's difficult to mobilize launched it was a please post your take you from their regular duties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>And I think it is had.</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>Some challenges getting there and then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>I'm assuming it's a result of direction from the mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>That. They didn't act proactively they they lined up and to have stayed in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>When the location pretty significant current time now that's the way from the mall I didn't see what was happening in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>In the mall he of these things are unpredictable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>129</td><td>It takes time to mobilize people and by then you already had the CBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>130</td><td>Looted U the fire started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>131</td><td>In that building and did the police cars that were that destroyed in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>132</td><td>You saw those optics quite frankly but not good on non on television on national TV so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>133</td><td>Did did did that you know cause additional problems not hard to say but it sort of escalated pretty quickly and then when it it got dark of course the new and fires Parikh so.</td></tr>

<tr><td>140</td><td>You know erupts from there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>141</td><td>You know sort of testing you had the young people throwing rocks cobblestones alone with what pretty big and that probably started and my own view if you have to act fairly quickly to arrest people assuming you can't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>142</td><td>That you have enough resource is to do that you don't want to listen to a three please hoses out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>143</td><td>Tourist group of people.</td></tr>

<tr><td>145</td><td>Quickly enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>146</td><td>And monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>147</td><td>Without more police departments now living in National Guard troops is this going to be enough.</td></tr>

<tr><td>155</td><td>And people from other jurisdictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>Sort of in stationary locations taking care of some some.</td></tr>
<tr><td>157</td><td>Infrastructure. Type of locations or buildings as opposed to having a mobile I think he.</td></tr>
<tr><td>158</td><td>Baltimore police should now be as much as possible mobile and be in position and may he rest ideally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>159</td><td>Arrest if they need to be made it mean they by the Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>160</td><td>Police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>161</td><td>We know that there's just a curfew imposed this evening starting at 10 PM.</td></tr>
