<h3>How a wedding gown designer took the fight against Ebola to New York Fashion Week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This was definitely not how Jill Andrews imagined making her way to New York Fashion Week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the Baltimore wedding gown designer couldn't be prouder of the garment she displayed in Manhattan this weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That loose-fitting yellow jumpsuit draped elegantly over a pouty mannequin at the Empire Hotel Friday night?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was her own one-of-a-kind creation - a prototype protective suit for health care workers fighting Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The suit was the product of a "hackathon" organised last year by Johns Hopkins University in the quest to improve upon the standard protective suits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jhpiego, a global health non-profit and affiliate of Johns Hopkins University, showcases an advanced protective suit for healthcare workers who treat Ebola patients during an event at New York Fashion Week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An email circled campus asking for volunteers to spend a weekend trying everything and anything to improve the safety of the gear that health care workers across the globe wear when treating patients with Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Applications flooded in from biomedical engineers, doctors, infection control specialists, accomplished students, experienced researchers ... and Andrews, a graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology, who designs bridal wear at her own small Charm City atelier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some people questioned what a woman normally surrounded by taffeta and lace could have to offer to the highly-technical challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A look at the advance in the suit design made by Jill Andrews and the Johns Hopkins team with personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by healthcare workers treating Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Four months later, Andrews laughs as she wonders what the Johns Hopkins team would have done without her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The university's team, with the help of Andrews's sewing skills and global health nonprofit Jhpiego, designed a safer, more efficient PPE (personal protective equipment) that could contribute to stopping the spread of Ebola by protecting the people treating the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>We wrote about how Andrews helped create the new and improved Ebola suit back in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The advanced protective suit for healthcare workers who treat Ebola patients is on show during Fashion Week event in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The next month, the redesigned PPE won the challenge posed by the US Agency for International Development, which was looking for innovations to "provide better, more timely care and to contain this devastating virus."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This meant USAID would provide $US1.7 million ($2.18 million) for the three winning ideas to undergo extensive testing, followed by mass production and use in the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But first, Andrews got to take the Ebola suit to Fashion Week, where Jhpiego had partnered with the International Rescue Committee and the GE Foundation to present a pop-up lounge on Friday night at the Empire Hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Fashion Week is about new designs," said Dr David Barash, chief medical officer of the GE Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Innovation was so important to the way Jhpiego approached the PPE.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"To have a wedding designer participate was in itself creative and thoughtful. Her engagement helped bring down the number of steps it takes to remove the suit from 20 to eight, from a 20 minute process to a 5 minute one. It was an extraordinary accomplishment if you think about it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Andrews spent many late nights transforming the suit from prototype to reality, including when USAID presented it to Ebola Czar Ron Klain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She beamed with pride when she was told her "baby" also made a trip to the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But looking ahead to her trip last week, Andrews was more nervous about finishing a wedding gown in time for a Valentine's Day bride than her unlikely New York Fashion Week debut.</td></tr>
