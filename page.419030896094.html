<h3>Jury Keeps Death Penalty Option for Aurora Gunman</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A jury voted on Monday to keep the death penalty as an option for James Holmes, the gunman who killed 12 people at a screening of a Batman movie in Aurora, Colorado, three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The sentencing phase now proceeds to the final phase, when jurors will decide between death and a sentence of life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jurors had the option of ruling out the death penalty after hearing last week from defense witnesses ? including Holmes' parents, who in emotional testimony asked the jury to spare his life because he is mentally ill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His father, Robert Holmes, said that he and his wife had no idea before the massacre that their eldest child was mentally ill or wanted to kill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said he still loved his son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Asked by a defense lawyer why, Holmes responded, "Well, he's my son and, you know, we always got along pretty well and he was actually an excellent kid."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Other witnesses described James Holmes as a happy, friendly child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The defense also called a court-appointed psychiatrist who said that severe mental illness, not hatred or a desire for notoriety, drove Holmes to kill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The same jury rejected an insanity defense and convicted Holmes of murdering 12 people and trying to kill 70 more in the attack, at a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises" in July 2012.</td></tr>
