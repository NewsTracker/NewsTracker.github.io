<h3>UEFA: Former IOC official candidate to lead FIFA task force</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former Olympic official Francois Carrard is the only current candidate to chair FIFA's reform task force, according to UEFA secretary general Gianni Infantino.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The task force has no leader weeks before a FIFA-set deadline of Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>24 to propose ideas for rebuilding the scandal-hit governing body's reputation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>World Cup sponsors Coca-Cola and Visa have asked FIFA to ensure the job goes to an "eminent" person from outside football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FIFA has promised to appoint an independent outsider after consulting the presidents of its six continental presidents, including UEFA's Michel Platini.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He (Carrard) is an excellent person and he has the necessary experience," Platini's right-hand man Infantino said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Carrard was the International Olympic Committee director general for 14 years, overseeing fallout and reforms after the Salt Lake City bidding corruption scandal broke in 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Lausanne-based lawyer declined comment to the Associated Press when asked about FIFA's offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Carrard worked for the IOC until 2003, including 12 years serving under the presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He has continued to represent the IOC in cases heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and sits on the board of IOC subsidiaries dealing with broadcasting and sponsorship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Infantino said Carrard was "a good proposal because you need someone who can unite."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Proposals to reform FIFA - which could include limiting the terms of presidents, publishing salaries and vetting officials' integrity more strictly - will be enacted only if voted in by member federations at their Feb. 26 congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 209 members will also elect a successor to President Sepp Blatter that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We must also reach out to a broad support," Infantino said of the task force's work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>If he accepts the offer, Carrard will lead an 11-member panel with his colleagues nominated by the confederations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>UEFA has already sent FIFA its two nominations to join the task force, said Infantino, who declined to identify the officials.</td></tr>
