<tr><td>2</td><td>Ivan revealed: "We want to expand the Ghostbusters universe in ways that will include different films, TV shows, merchandise, all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"This is a branded entertainment, a scary supernatural premise mixed with comedy. Paul Feig's film will be the first version of that, shooting in June to come out in July 2016. He's got four of the funniest women in the world, and there will be other surprises to come."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kristin Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones will feature in the 2016 movie, while 22 Jump Street star Channing is set to produce and feature as a protagonist in a subsequent film - written by Mission: Impossible 5 scriptwriter Drew Pearce - having previously been linked to the project in a series of Sony emails leaked last year.</td></tr>

It's just the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of wonderful movies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"My primary focus will be to build the Ghostbusters into the universe it always promised it might become. The original film is beloved, as is the cast, and we hope to create films we will continue to love."</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>Israel and his family denied that he was an Israeli spy.</td></tr>
