<tr><td>76</td><td>During a 2008 debate, however, Clinton said that she would only raise the rate "above the 20% if I raised it at all. I would not raise it above what it was during the Clinton administration."</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Clinton responded to a CNN question during the chat about the change, stating that "the increase in short-termism has grown in urgency since 2008, and the urgency of our solutions has to match it."</td></tr>

<tr><td>83</td><td>"Give people a reason to improve the culture of their firms."</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Asked about how she'd curtail Wall Street misconduct, Clinton offered a few specific policy proposals -- noting that Tuesday is the fifth anniversary of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform law, and saying she wants to go further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>She said she would prosecute individuals responsible for fraud and other misdeeds, rather than just taking on their firms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>She also called for an increase to whistleblower caps, which are currently limited to $1.6 million or less -- far less than the bonuses many Wall Street executives earn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>And she said that when firms are forced to pay fines for wrongdoing, those amounts should come out of the bonus checks that go to their executives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>"Amen, sister."</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>It wasn't all serious, as Clinton -- whose three decades in the limelight have hardened many Americans' views of her -- sought to show a more human side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>She said she loves Dickson Street in Fayetteville, Arkansas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>She said she's "never met a pantsuit I didn't love."</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>And she posted an image of Saturday Night Live's Kate McKinnon playing Clinton.</td></tr>

<tr><td>95</td><td>"It's a daily challenge. I do the best I can -- and as you may have noticed, some days are better than others!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>"Good to see you in Arkansas on Saturday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>One of the biggest takeaways to the chat was the fact Clinton did it at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Since leaving the State Department in 2013, Clinton spent most of her time keeping the press -- and questions in general -- at arm's length.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>She did paid events where moderators asked her questions and she almost never spoke with reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>Since launching her campaign in April, though, Clinton has slowly grown more to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>She held her first press conference in New Hampshire last month and conducted her first national interview with CNN earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Monday's Facebook chat, her first as a candidate, is part of that evolution, particularly with the press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Clinton took four questions from reporters on Monday, including one from CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>While the format is admittedly safe for politicians, the fact she answered questions from reporters is notable.</td></tr>
