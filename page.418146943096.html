<h3>Google denied appeal in Oracle software fight</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sided with Oracle Corp. and declined to hear Google Inc.'s appeal in a major software copyright case that has been closely followed by the technology industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The decision leaves intact a ruling which allows Oracle to charge licensing fees for the use of some of its Java programming language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google had argued it should be free to use Java without paying a fee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The case involves how much copyright protection should extend to Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google, which used Java to design its Android smartphone operating system, said in court papers that an Oracle victory would obstruct "an enormous amount of innovation" because software developers would not be able to freely build on each others' work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Oracle said effective copyright protection is the key to software innovation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Google representative did not immediately comment on the court's decision, and an Oracle spokeswoman could not immediately be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google's Android operating system is the world's best-selling smartphone platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Oracle sued Google in 2010, and is seeking roughly $1 billion on its copyright claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Shares of Google were down about 0.7 percent at $527.9 in early trading, while Oracle was down about 0.43 percent at $40.8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Obama administration, which was asked to weigh in on the issue earlier this year, asked the Supreme Court not to take the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The litigation now returns to a San Francisco federal court for more proceedings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The case is Google v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Oracle, U.S. Supreme Court, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>14-410.</td></tr>
