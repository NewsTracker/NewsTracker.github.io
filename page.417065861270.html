<h3>CANNES TREND: It's all eyes on shoulders on red carpet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES (AP) - It's all eyes on shoulders at the Cannes Film Festival, with red-carpet stars ditching the bust in favor of accentuating the upper torso and shoulders - through embellishments or bare skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Charlize Theron wowed crowds at the French Riviera's "Mad Max: Fury Road" premiere in a black Valentino dress with a horizontal tulle section across her shoulders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Emma Stone repeated this coup in a black Oscar de la Renta lace dress with a sheer band across the upper torso at the "Irrational Man" photo call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rachel Weisz chanelled a similar style but in white for "The Lobster" premiere - in a Louis Vuitton gown with a sequined section that drew eyes up to her shoulders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Elsewhere, the trend was for shoulders to be sexily exposed with truncated gowns - with the top parts lopped off - like Natalie Portman's delicate Dior strapless gown in black and pale blue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One of the best shoulder looks was comeback kid Sienna Miller who shone in a speckled gray Balenciaga off-the-shoulder dress from Fall 2015 with a band that accentuated her enviable upper torso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The secret for shoulders is: Toned, but not too skinny!</td></tr>
