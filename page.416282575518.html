<h3>A look at why Greece is again in danger of default</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>By the day, Greece is getting closer to a potentially catastrophic debt default that could force it out of the euro bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>All it needs to avoid that fate is a deal with its creditors to get more loans - yet weeks of wrangling over the terms have produced no sign of progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The situation is coming to a head, with Greece struggling to meet debt obligations on a weekly basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It faces repayments worth 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) next month that it may be unable to afford without more rescue loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rescue creditors - fellow eurozone states and the International Monetary Fund - want Greece to agree to a list of economic reforms that the country's new government came to power promising to oppose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece's finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, will have a chance to meet officials from the IMF and other key creditors at a global conference Washington this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But all sides concede that a breakthrough is unlikely by an end-of-April deadline they set to unlock the latest batch of bailout loans, which have been delayed from last summer and are worth 7.2 billion euros ($7.7 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Here's a look at why, despite the high stakes, the two sides remain at an impasse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Eurozone states and the IMF say they cannot keep pouring billions of euros of rescue funds into a country that refuses to modernize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Greece must become competitive. Otherwise it's a bottle without a bottom. And you can't spend hundreds of billions ... on a bottle without a bottom," said German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greece's problem, the creditors argue, was initially caused by gorging on cheap loans in the good times a decade ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>So reforms should focus on reducing costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since Athens started getting 240 billion euros in bailout loans in 2010 to avoid bankruptcy it has slashed pensions, state jobs, and welfare benefits, sold state assets and raised taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For Greece to get more loans, creditors are demanding reforms to make state administration and business rules more efficient: Scrapping multiple tax exemptions, removing obstacles to mass lay-offs for struggling businesses, restarting a major privatization program, and reforming a pension system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The creditors note that five years of such reforms have improved Greek public finances, while the economy emerged briefly from recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But to be confident Greece will be able to repay its rescue loans - which have ballooned national debt to 317 billion euros ($338 billion) at the end of 2014 - they want assurances that those extra reforms will be made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greece is the least competitive economy in the eurozone and the 81st globally, according to the World Economic Forum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his Syriza party came to power in January with one main promise: end austerity measures previous Greek governments had agreed to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tsipras argues the measures must be redrawn to stimulate growth, and not just cut debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He blames them for causing a humanitarian crisis: the economy has shrunk by a quarter, leaving more than 25 percent of people without work, and even more without health insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In drawing up the new proposed reforms, Tsipras is focusing mainly on trying to fight tax evasion by the rich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That will only get the government so much money, as much of its massive tax arrears comes from ordinary households and bankrupt businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tsipras' government has opposed other projects, such as further privatizations, and any talk of limiting job protection rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>His bargaining position could be limited by having a large far-left faction in his party and nationalist-right coalition partners who demand a tough position against creditors' demands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The new government's combative style has isolated Greece in the 19-member eurozone but is hugely popular at home, despite the financial risks involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A weekend opinion poll suggests the Syriza party has a near 25-point lead over rival conservatives, more than double the advantage it had in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"It has become well-nigh politically impossible for any Greek government to implement the reform policies being demanded by eurozone leaders," said Joan Hoey, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>If Greece is to avoid default, a compromise is needed, and Athens is under the most pressure to yield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Economists say the eurozone is better protected against the financial instability that could come from Greece leaving the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Sovereign downgrades and a surge in borrowing rates in recent week caused little market panic outside Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But for Greece, leaving the currency would cause huge economic turmoil, at least in the short term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In seeking a deal, the Greek government has agreed to some things it had previously ruled out, such as continued external oversight of the country's finances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But lenders are adamant Athens must accept more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He says Tsipras could compromise and accept some cost-savings reforms in return for more modest budget targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Tsipras could sell it to the public," said Palaiologos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Convincing his own party might be more difficult."</td></tr>
