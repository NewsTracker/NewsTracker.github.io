<h3>Apple Now Accepting Trade-Ins on Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phones</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple stores in North America and parts of Europe are to accept Android, Blackberry and Windows phones from March 30 as trade-ins towards new handsets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>France, Germany, the UK and Italy are also included in the program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The move is made possible due to an existing agreement with platform-agnostic distributor Brightstar, which as part of its remit, specializes in retail trade-ins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As 9to5mac notes, store credit can then be applied to purchases of the iPhone 5c, 6 and 6 Plus, to the exclusion of the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Last week, Apple had announced a buyback program for China, with manufacturer Foxconn to oversee the resale of used handsets, initially through a selection of e-commerce websites and then other physical stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A February 2015 IDC report placed Android at 81.5% global market share in 2014 against Apple s 14.8%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>According to Brightstar s iPhone recycling guide, an unlocked, fully functioning and good condition black iPhone 4S would fetch US $35 in store credit.</td></tr>
