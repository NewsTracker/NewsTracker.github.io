<h3>David Letterman drives into retirement with Indy 500 tribute (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- David Letterman has a new No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1 on his personal Top Ten list of reasons he loves the Indianapolis 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The freshly retired Letterman was all grins early Sunday as his IndyCar team paid tribute to the former ''Late Show'' host by putting a gap-toothed, smiling caricature of his face and (hash)thanksdave on driver Oriol Servia's yellow car for the big race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''With everything that's happened, it's the highlight of my career,'' Letterman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It's crazy it's the Indianapolis 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Regrettable my face, but also my name on that car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Letterman was dressed in a red shirt with a race sponsor ''Steak 'n Shake'' logo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He promised Servia he would buy the burgers with an Indy win, but he can save his cash for retirement: Servia was knocked out of the running with an accident just past the halfway point of the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Letterman was born and raised in Indianapolis, spending his younger years in the Broad Ripple section of town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He went to Ball State in Muncie, Indiana, and early in his career served as a pit reporter for ABC; search on YouTube for his interview of Mario Andretti after the former champion crashed out of the 1971 race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Letterman got into team ownership in the 1990s with former Indy 500 champion Bobby Rahal, and businessman Mike Lanigan came aboard to form what is now Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Letterman struck a friendship with Rahal after the retired driver appeared on his show after winning the 1986 Indy 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Letterman could have filled an Indy 500 starting grid with all the series drivers he had on the show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Graham and Bobby Rahal were guests on ''The Late Show'' and the Indy 500 champion usually brought along the Borg-Warner Trophy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''I'm just really pissed off because he finished this week,'' Servia joked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''He couldn't wait until next week?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Not this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The crash marred what had been a fun morning for the former host.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It was easy to find the Rahal Letterman Racing spot in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway paddock: There was a red ''Late Show with David Letterman'' sign and the same grinning caricature that was featured on Servia's car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Team members wore gray T-shirts with their own ''Top Ten'' list of reasons they love Letterman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Among them: Cries on the parade lap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Letterman was relaxed as he strolled through Indianapolis Motor Speedway, even inviting one fan over a barrier to sign autographs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''Are you nervous?'' Servia asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''No, I won't be nervous until they start 'em up and then I just get crazy nervous,'' Letterman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Not wanting to get left out of the father-son bonding of the Rahals, Letterman claimed Servia as his own offspring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''Yes, I sent away to one of those genetic testing places where they do the swab and it turns out he is in fact my son,'' Letterman cracked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''Bobby and Graham are father and son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Letterman ended his 33-year career as a late-night television host Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He presided over 6,028 broadcasts on CBS and NBC, making Top 10 lists and ironic humor staples of television comedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Letterman joked that he needed ''some kind of intravenous medication'' to recover from the grind of the final weeks of his show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''Then the next day you feel a little bit better, and the next day you feel a little bit better,'' said Letterman, whose team won the race in 2004 with Buddy Rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''Now here we are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Letterman said he would watch the race from pit lane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>At least he could find a seat, unlike the ones that were stripped from the Ed Sullivan Theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Parts of Letterman's set from his show's home were quickly dumped in the trash and scooped by fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''Not only did they take the set and tear it up, they took all the seats out of the theater two days later,'' Letterman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''What that does is remind you that it's show business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It's just show business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Thirty-three years, what do I care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Let them take the seats out, let them do anything they want.</td></tr>
