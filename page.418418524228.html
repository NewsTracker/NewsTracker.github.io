<h3>Test shows new Liberian Ebola case similar to earlier virus</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DAKAR/GENEVA Tests on the Ebola virus that claimed Liberia's first victim since it was declared Ebola-free in May showed it was closely related to an earlier Liberian strain, the World Health Organization and a health official said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The findings suggest the disease was never entirely eliminated from the West African country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It indicates that the virus is closely related to one that was circulating in Liberia in that particular area," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said, confirming initial results of the genetic tests obtained by Reuters.</td></tr>
