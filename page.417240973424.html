<h3>Rosberg wins Monaco GP after crash hampers Hamilton (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MONACO (AP) -- An ill-judged gamble by Mercedes cost Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton his fourth win of the season, gifting his teammate and rival Nico Rosberg a third straight win at the Monaco Grand Prix and putting him firmly back in the title race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Formula One's showcase race passes by the famed Monte Carlo casino, where big fortunes have been won and lost on its famed tables over the decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Rosberg could never have imagined hitting the jackpot in such a way, as Hamilton was suddenly called back to the pits for a tire change shortly after a crash involving teenager Max Verstappen led to a safety car being deployed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was an astonishing mistake from F1's ultra-dominant team, with Hamilton more than 15 seconds ahead at that point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It led to an apology from Mercedes head of motorsport Toto Wolff, who seemed more baffled than convincing, as he explained that the decision was based on a technological data feed rather than any strategy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I don't think there has ever been a more bittersweet feeling than this one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>We have won the Monaco Grand Prix and we have lost the Monaco Grand Prix all at the same time,'' Wolff said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''This is a day when we simply have to say sorry to our driver, because our mistake cost him the victory here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>What happened?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hamilton did not look happy, walking slowly and despondently out of his car with his head down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''I can't really express the way I feel at the moment, so I won't even attempt to,'' Hamilton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The two-time champion had good cause to feel angry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rosberg, who won the Spanish GP two weeks ago, is now just 10 points behind after securing back-to-back wins for the first time in his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Four-time F1 champion Sebastian Vettel is less of a threat, but the Ferrari driver finished second to close the gap on Hamilton to 28 points heading into the Canadian GP in two weeks' time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hamilton looked set to take his 37th career win after leading from the start, until the 17-year-old Verstappen rammed his Toro Rosso into Romain Grosjean's Lotus as he tried to overtake on the right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That meant a safety car had to come out at the start of the 64th lap, at which point Hamilton was then called in to change to quicker and softer tires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>After the change, he suddenly found himself behind both Rosberg and Vettel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Hamilton then had only a few laps to try and get past them - on the most difficult track to overtake on F1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Rosberg, who coincidentally launched his title bid at exactly the same stage last year, was modest in victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''I know that I got lucky today, so I'll just enjoy the moment now,'' the German said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Russian driver Daniil Kvyat finished fourth for Red Bull's best result this season, while former champion Jenson Button finally earned McLaren its first points of the campaign by coming eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But teammate Fernando Alonso retired for the second straight race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>As well as securing his 10th career win, Rosberg became the first driver since Ayrton Senna to win Monaco three straight times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The others to do it were Frenchman Alain Prost and Briton Graham Hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But, happy as he was, Rosberg reached out to Hamilton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''For sure it is an awful feeling,'' the German driver Rosberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Verstappen - who had never driven on Monaco's sinewy street circuit before - tried to pass Grosjean but found no room and went spinning off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Verstappen was handed a two-point penalty and a five-place grid penalty for the next race - although the daring teen blamed Grosjean for braking too early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>There was plenty of reason for Hamilton to cast blame, and the Briton angrily snapped over the radio: ''Please stop talking to me, please'' as the race was drawing to a close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>As Rosberg and Vettel celebrated warmly with each other, Hamilton took a long while to join the other two on the podium, but made the point of shaking Rosberg's hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But he will be hurting badly heading into Montreal, where Mercedes' team strategy will be closely scrutinized.</td></tr>
