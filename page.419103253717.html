<h3>Prosecutor: Mexican suspect was at apartment where 5 slain</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this April 28, 2015 photo, Mexican photojournalist Ruben Espinosa places a plaque to rename a plaza after slain journalist Regina Martinez in the city of Xalapa, in Mexico's Gulf state of Veracruz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Three years ago Martinez was killed and now on August 1, Espinosa himself was tortured and killed along with four other people inside an apartment building in Mexico City, the city where he had sought refuge after being threatened in the state of Veracruz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A man suspected in the killings of a Mexican photojournalist and four women has acknowledged being in the apartment where the slayings occurred, Mexico City's top prosecutor said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prosecutor Rodolfo Rios told the Televisa network that the suspect was one of three men whom surveillance cameras recorded leaving the apartment building on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rios declined to identify the man, who he said previously served nearly 10 years in prison for rape and causing injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rios wouldn't say whether the suspect had confessed to either the killings or the robbery police say apparently was carried out at the apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The victims included Ruben Espinosa, a photojournalist who fled the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz because of intimidation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was found shot in the head, his body bound and tortured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The attackers also killed his friend, activist Nadia Vera, and two of her roommates - a 19-year-old aspiring makeup artist and a woman from Colombia - as well as their 40-year-old housekeeper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rios said investigators had not yet determined the motive in the killings, and that all lines of investigation remained open, including the possibility it could have been related to Espinosa's work.</td></tr>
