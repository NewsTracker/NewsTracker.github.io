<h3>E-cigarettes, craft beer and Spotify enter UK inflation basket</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Britain's consumer prices index is based on the cost of more than 700 goods and services, a handful of which are changed each year as shoppers' tastes change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"With the decrease in the popularity of traditional media, music streaming services -- such as Spotify -- are being included for the first time, as are online console computer games subscriptions," the ONS said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Leaving the index this year are yoghurt drinks, fees at foreign exchange bureaux, and stand-alone satellite navigation systems for cars, as drivers either use navigation software on their mobile phones or buy cars with navigation built in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Other new goods include melons, sweet potatoes, mobile phone chargers and powdered protein drinks for body-builders, intended to capture a broader growth in purchases of sport-related food supplements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prices for fresh pizzas now replace frozen pizzas, and coloured paint replaces white paint as trends in interior decoration change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Britain's inflation rate fell to 0.3 percent in January, its lowest level since the consumer price index was launched in 1989, hit mostly by plunging global oil prices.</td></tr>

<h3>German Investor Confidence Inches Higher</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A survey is showing a smaller-than-expected rise in German investor confidence as concerns over Greece's debt crisis and the conflict in Ukraine hold back sentiment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ZEW institute said Tuesday that its monthly confidence index, which measures investors' economic outlook for the next half-year, crept up to 54.8 points for March from 53 in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That's a 13-month high but is below economists' forecast of an increase to 60.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The German economy, Europe's biggest, is in robust shape and Frankfurt's DAX index of blue chip stocks has hit a string of record highs in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, ZEW president Clemens Fuest said that a lack of progress in resolving the Greek crisis and the Ukrainian conflict "has a dampening effect on sentiment."</td></tr>
