<h3>Greek debt crisis: France to the rescue as Tsipras accepts austerity for relief</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Athens: Only a day after grim predictions of financial and social collapse in Greece, a scramble appeared underway to work out the details of a new bailout package to bring the country back from the brink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As details of the new offer emerged, it appeared that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was capitulating to demands that he urged his countrymen to reject in last Sunday's referendum, such as tax increases and various measures to cut the costs of pensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A protester holds a European Union flag with a euro currency symbol at a rally outside the Greek parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He appealed to his Syriza MPs on Friday to back a fiscal plan in return for aid from creditors, a government official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are confronted with crucial decisions," a government official quoted Mr Tsipras telling his party colleagues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We got a mandate to bring better deal than the ultimatum that the Eurogroup gave us, but [were] certainly not given a mandate to take Greece out of the eurozone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Mr Tsipras seemed to have gained ground on debt relief, his one bedrock demand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble finally gave a little on that on Thursday, admitting that "debt sustainability is not feasible without a haircut", or write-down, of debt, even if he then appeared to backtrack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (seated) is applauded by his colleagues in the ruling Syriza party inside the Greek parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Donald Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland and the president of the European Council, said on Twitter that any "realistic proposal from Athens needs to be matched by [a] realistic proposal from creditors on debt sustainability to create win-win situation".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Tsipras went before Greece's parliament to seek a commitment for reform measures in the new plan that, presumably, went beyond what had been offered previously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Much may hinge on his ability to persuade the more radical elements of his Syriza party to support a package that in essence was anathema to many of them last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It is still too early to gauge whether this prospective bailout will be any more effective than earlier pacts in balancing the demands of the creditors against some relief from austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Under pressure: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, in Belgrade on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>What was breathtaking, however, was how in a matter of hours the entire dynamic in the Greek crisis seemed to shift, from apocalyptic warnings of a Zimbabwe in the Balkans, to a fresh optimism that the basics of a deal could be worked out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The question now is whether that apparent change of heart reflected a new political determination to cut a deal that keeps Greece in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The representatives of Greece's main creditors - the eurozone nations, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - are scheduled to review the new proposal in Brussels on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Final approval will also require an assessment by the 19 finance ministers of eurozone countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That meeting, of the Eurogroup, has been scheduled for Saturday afternoon in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>One analyst said he thought the offer would be well received by creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The package takes a very substantial step in the right direction and it should move us closer to a deal," said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, shortly after reading one version of the Greek offer translated into English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The question now is whether the Greeks are actually going to implement some of the measures over the course weekend by putting them before their parliament, as German officials seems to be demanding," Mr Rahman added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Greece received vital political support and technical assistance from France, help that highlighted the contrasting approaches being taken by the two leading powers in the European Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Germany has played the bad cop, standing firm against concessions to Greece and, in Dr Schauble's case, openly doubting the country really belonged in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>France has thrown itself into the task of finding a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The French assistance appeared to be an effort to make sure the Greek proposal, submitted just before a midnight deadline, would be as thorough and saleable as possible to Greece's creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"There is a group of people who have been sent to help the Greeks, to try to transform words into action," said a French government official with knowledge of the effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Neither French nor German officials would discuss France's involvement in the Greek proposal in any depth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But the development raised questions about whether France and Germany have split heading into the final negotiations or whether there is a backroom understanding between Paris and Berlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking later in Sarajevo, reiterated her opposition to actually writing off some of Greece's debt, though she was less definitive about steps like reducing interest rates or extending the payment period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The situation has put Dr Merkel into the toughest position of her career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>She has been forced to balance an angry German public, which sees no reason to give Greece billions of additional bailout money or to write down any more of its debt, against the danger of a Greek exit from the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Greece is a tiny country with limited economic impact on Europe but considerable strategic value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>European political experts had wondered throughout the week whether Dr Merkel was willing to risk the prospect of a failed, embittered state within the European Union and NATO, an open wound in Europe's southern and eastern flank that would be an open invitation to Moscow to exploit already inflamed division within the European Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>When Greece in 2012 was the epicentre of the last flare-up in Europe's long-running debt crisis, many French officials steadfastly maintained that the eurozone was fundamentally a historic project, and that it should not risk being broken up by the departure of Greece nor of any other euro member country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>That sentiment was reaffirmed by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"France refuses that Greece leaves the eurozone in the name of our position and our commitments," he told MPs in France's National Assembly on Wednesday, in a speech broadcast live on Greek television.</td></tr>
