<h3>Stocks close higher on optimism for Greek deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. stocks logged their best day in two months Friday as Greece appeared to move closer to securing a bailout deal that will enable it to avoid bankruptcy and keep the country in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece and its creditors appeared to be narrowing their differences after Athens offered reform proposals in order to secure a third bailout of around 53 billion euros ($59.5 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A final decision could be made on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A second day of gains for Chinese stocks also encouraged investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>U.S. stocks had fallen sharply on Wednesday, in part on concern that a monthlong slump in China's stock market could crimp growth in the world's second-largest economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is a giant collective exhaling," said Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Greek deal "is not done, but we're closer than we have been in a while."</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>On Friday, stocks in China jumped before the U.S. market opened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>China's Shanghai Composite Index jumped 4.5 percent, paring its losses for the month to 24 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Chinese market is only recovering after the government intervened heavily and about half of the companies listed in mainland China suspended trading in their stocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That's making some investors cautious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The policy makers appear to have some success in stabilizing values, but fifty percent of Chinese stocks are not currently trading," said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Back in the U.S., airline stocks rallied after American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, signaled that it was cutting back on its growth plans this year amid signs that average fares are declining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>American said it expects to increase passenger-carrying capacity by 1 percent this year, down from an earlier forecast of 2 percent.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>Among the companies reporting are banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, as well as Delta, Netflix and Intel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Earnings will be adequate, we don't expect them to blow out the lights," said Allianz's Hooper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"It will be a subdued, but mildly positive earnings environment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Companies in the S&P 500 are forecast to report that earnings shrank by 4.5 percent on average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>While that would be the first contraction in earnings in almost six years, the figures are distorted by a big drop in energy company earnings following the collapse in the oil price last year.</td></tr>
