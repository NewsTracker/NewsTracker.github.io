<h3>Egypt's winemakers seek to revive ancient art</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this Wednesday, May 27, 2015 photo, a worker rests outside a lab at the Gianaclis winery, one of Egypt's main wineries, in the Nile Delta, north of Cairo, Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - An organic wine producer is growing indigenous grapes near famed pharaonic tombs in central Egypt, vintners in the Nile Delta have modernized a long-neglected 19th century winery, and in Cairo's hotels, tourists can now enjoy Egyptian wine described by an expert as "eminently drinkable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's all part of a now 15-year effort to revive Egypt's small wine industry, which mainly caters to tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The country's two main winemakers benefit from a customs regime that keeps out virtually all imports, but they face the challenge of growing grapes in a searing desert climate and marketing their products in a conservative Muslim country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kouroum of the Nile, an organic winery based in the Red Sea resort of el-Gouna, has planted 120 acres of Bannati grapes, an indigenous variety used for its premium Beausoleil white wine, in central Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The vineyard is an hour's drive north of Beni Hassan, the site of well-preserved 3,600-year-old pharaonic tombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Labib Kallas, the Lebanese manager of the winery, said the idea was to make an authentic local wine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"When a tourist comes to a specific country ... he wants to taste the food of the country and drink the beverages produced in the country," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"When a tourist comes to Egypt and he drinks a wine that is not Egyptian, it's a shameful thing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kouroum has another, much larger vineyard in the Nile Delta north of Cairo, where it grows imported varieties of grapes for its Jardin du Nil line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Growers rely on irrigation and must strike a delicate balance, giving the plants just enough water to survive the desert heat but not so much that it dilutes the flavor of the grapes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Given such conditions, Egypt is unlikely to emerge as a top wine producer anytime soon, or even challenge nearby Lebanon, Israel, Turkey or Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Kallas says the winery has succeeded in making an authentic and enjoyable local product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Whether we like it or not, it's Egyptian wine," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We were really surprised from the quality we've made, because our challenge from the beginning was just to produce a drinkable wine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Jardin du Nil wines have won a handful of medals at European wine competitions and were awarded a bronze medal by the Decanter wine magazine in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Scottish wine writer Tom Cannavan gave Jardin du Nil a favorable review on his website that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The chance to taste something new, from somewhere new, is always interesting. I'd happily enjoy a glass or two of these Egyptian wines in the future," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Such praise would have been unheard of a decade ago, when most Egyptian wine was little more than a headache in a bottle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In ancient times, Egypt was part of a winemaking tradition spanning the eastern Mediterranean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tomb paintings show ancient Egyptians crushing grapes and pharaohs sipping wine from goblets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The builders of the pyramids at Giza were given a daily ration of low-alcohol beer - a more salubrious alternative to water from the Nile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Winemaking fell out of fashion after the 7th century Muslim conquest, but enjoyed a brief revival in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Egypt was under British colonial rule and Cairo was a freewheeling, cosmopolitan city with sizable European, Jewish and Armenian communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In 1882, Greek entrepreneur Nestor Gianaclis founded a winery in the Delta with grapes nurtured by the annual Nile flood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But the winery was nationalized in the 1960s and fell into neglect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The industry was privatized in the late 1990s, and within a few years Gianaclis was acquired by Al-Ahram Beverages Company, the country's leading producer of beer, wine and spirits, now owned by the Heineken Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The winery has since been rebuilt and modernized, and the company runs tours of the facility from Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Gianaclis grows its own grapes elsewhere in the Delta, but its most popular premium wines are made with grapes imported from France, Lebanon and South Africa.</td></tr>
