<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Defying the extremists, hundreds of Tunisians rallied Thursday at the National Bardo Museum, stepping around trails of blood and broken glass to proclaim their solidarity with the victims and with Tunisia's fledgling democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One person carried a sign saying "Tunisia is bloodied but still standing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tunisian security forces, meanwhile, arrested nine people, the president's office said, adding that five of them were directly connected to Wednesday's attack on the Bardo by two gunmen who were later slain by police.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Prime Minister Habib Essid told France's RTL radio that Tunisia was working with other countries to learn more about the slain attackers, identified as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said Laabidi had been flagged to the intelligence agency, although not for "anything special."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Wednesday's attack was the worst at a tourist site in Tunisia in more than a decade and prompted a leading Italian cruise ship line to announce it was canceling all stops in Tunisia indefinitely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The deaths of tourists will create oceans of trouble for the country's tourism industry, which brings throngs of foreigners every year to Tunisia's Mediterranean beaches, desert oases and ancient Roman ruins - and which had just started to recover after years of slump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Two major cruise ships whose passengers had been among the victims left the port of Tunis early Thursday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>"They are targeting knowledge. They are targeting science. They are targeting reason. They are targeting history. They are targeting memory, because all these things mean nothing in their eyes," she told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"There is only their reactionary, very backward and sclerotic ideology."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Later in the afternoon, authorities opened the gates of the museum for a rally in defiance of the bloodshed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>21</td><td>The statement said the attack was just "the first drop of rain" and promised further strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tunisia has faced scattered extremist violence for the past few years, and a disproportionately large number of Tunisians have joined Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>According to survivors and witnesses, two or more gunmen attacked the museum wielding assault rifles and began gunning down tourists in front of a row of about 10 buses.</td></tr>
