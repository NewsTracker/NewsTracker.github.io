<h3>FIFA's top spokesman leaves his job as European lawmakers urge Sepp Blatter to do the same</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GENEVA - FIFA's top spokesman left his job Thursday, hours after Sepp Blatter was urged to do the same by the European Parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA communications director Walter De Gregorio, closely tied to the embattled FIFA president since 2011, left his job three days after telling a joke about soccer's governing body on a TV talk show.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Schawinski closed the show by asking De Gregorio to tell his favorite joke about FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>De Gregorio set up the punchline by saying the FIFA president, himself and secretary general Jerome Valcke were in a car, so who was driving?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After a pause for the host to comment, De Gregorio gave the answer: "The police."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Earlier, lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, voted on a resolution calling for Blatter to speed up his planned resignation and let FIFA appoint an interim leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There was no immediate response from FIFA, which was plunged into crisis two weeks ago by separate American and Swiss corruption investigations.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>FIFA rules require senior vice president Issa Hayatou of Cameroon to step up as interim president if Blatter leaves before the election.</td></tr>
