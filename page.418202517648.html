<h3>Wall St. ends higher but energy stocks fall and Greece hopes waver</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. stocks closed higher on Wednesday but were down from earlier highs as energy stocks declined and Greece's debt crisis showed no clear signs of resolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The benchmark S&P 500's energy sector was dragged down by the biggest slide in oil prices since April after traders were surprised by a report that showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose for the first time in more than two months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Euro zone central bank chiefs kept in place their cap on a funding lifeline to Greece, maintaining pressure as Greece's lenders run out of cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The country's banks have been shut since Monday ahead of a Sunday referendum on the bailout package offered by its international lenders last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said Athens aims to secure a deal Monday and would be willing to accept "strict" conditions in a new bailout package, if the sustainability of Greece's debt is guaranteed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Investor hopes for a Greek debt deal, which earlier had helped drive a rally, ebbed during the day, according to Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Until it's all said and done they're just jockeying for position back and forth. The negotiation process still isn't over," Matousek said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Many investors were also holding off ahead of Thursday's scheduled release of the closely watched U.S. non-farm payroll report for June while the three-day weekend celebrating the U.S. July Fourth holiday kept others away, said Brian Fenske, head of sales trading at ITG in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While the market was primarily driven by Greece's woes, stronger-than-expected jobs and construction data gave stocks some support as did Swiss insurance giant ACE Ltd's (ACE.N) $28 billion offer for upmarket property insurer Chubb Corp (CB.N).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Chubb's shares ended up 26 percent to $119.99, making it the second biggest boost for the S&P 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rival Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) rose 2.7 percent, the biggest driver for the Dow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>U.S. private employers added 237,000 jobs in June, the biggest gain since December, while construction spending rose in May to its highest level in just over 6-1/2 years, reports showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 138.4 points, or 0.79 percent, to 17,757.91, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 14.31 points, or 0.69 percent, to 2,077.42, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 26.26 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,013.12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The S&P energy sector .SPNY fell 1.3 percent, the only S&P sector in the red on Wednesday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>Brent LCOc1 settled off 2.5 percent at $62.01.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Airline stocks tumbled after the U.S. Department of Justice said it was investigating whether some carriers were colluding to keep ticket prices high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,914 to 1,179, for a 1.62-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,475 issues rose and 1,288 fell for a 1.15-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 14 new 52-week highs and 22 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 89 new lows.</td></tr>
