<h3>Stefani grins, bears it for 'Paddington' tune</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>So sure, Gwen Stefani joining her fellow judge from The Voice to write the ballad Shine for the movie Paddington was pretty much a no-brainer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The flick (available via digital HD April 17 and Blu-ray/DVD April 28), which follows the famous computer-animated Peruvian bear from Michael Bond's classic books on a trip home to London, also appealed to Stefani on a few other non-musical levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She explains in this exclusive clip from the "Making of Shine" bonus feature that much of it comes from her life being a mom of three and wife to English rocker Gavin Rossdale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The highlights: Most of the movies she sees as a mom are children's films, the movie contains little details she notices from her normal English life - such as the weird little tomato ketchup thing - and the street where they filmed parts of Paddington also happened to be right behind Stefani's London abode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yes, Pharrell, you were one of them, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Don't worry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Fans of Paddington - which stars Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Nicole Kidman as a villainous taxidermist and Ben Whishaw as the voice of the lovable bear - can also look forward to other extras including a "Meet the Characters" featurette and a look at bringing the literary creature from page to screen.</td></tr>

<h3>Snowden: CIA tried to hack Apple devices for nearly a decade</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Researchers at the Central Intelligence Agency have worked for nearly a decade to break the security protecting Apple phones and tablets, investigative news site The Intercept reported on Tuesday, citing documents obtained from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's not clear from the documents whether the intelligence service successfully breached Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The latest documents cover a period from 2006 to 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The report cites top-secret U.S. documents that suggest U.S. government researchers had created a version of XCode, Apple's software application development tool, to create surveillance backdoors into programs distributed on Apple's App Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Intercept has in the past published a number of reports from documents released by whistleblower Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The site's editors include Glenn Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his work in reporting on Snowden's revelations, and by Oscar-winning documentary maker Laura Poitras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Efforts to break into Apple products by government security researchers started as early as 2006, a year before Apple introduced its first iPhone and continued through the launch of the iPad in 2010 and beyond, The Intercept said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Breeching Apple security was part of a top-secret program by the U.S. government, aided by British intelligence researchers, to hack "secure communications products, both foreign and domestic" including Google Android phones, the news site said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that their products have not become tools for widespread government surveillance of citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Last September, Apple strengthened encryption methods for data stored on iPhones, saying the changes meant the company no longer had any way to extract customer data on the devices, even if a government ordered it to with a search warrant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Silicon Valley rival Google Inc. said shortly afterward that it also planned to increase the use of stronger encryption tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both companies said the moves were aimed at protecting the privacy of users of their products and that this was partly a response to wide scale U.S. government spying on Internet users revealed by Snowden in the summer of 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron have expressed concern that turning such privacy-enhancing tools into mass market features could prevent governments from tracking militants planning attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The CIA did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>An Apple spokesman pointed to public statements by Chief Executive Tim Cook on privacy, but declined to comment further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services," Cook wrote in a statement on privacy and security published last year.</td></tr>
