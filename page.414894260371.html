<h3>Ceasefire doesn't end fighting in Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Ukrainian military said pro-Russian separatists had attacked positions held by government troops 49 times in the past 24 hours, using rockets, artillery and armoured vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The number of attacks show the terrorists do not want to completely silence their guns," Ukrainian military spokesman Anatoly Stelmach said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said there had been some shelling in the district of Mariupol, a mostly government-held territory on the Sea of Azov, that Kiev fears may become the focus of the separatists' next offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The rebels accused the government forces of also staging attacks, including on what they said were residential areas of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One woman was killed in the shelling on Thursday, the separatist press service DAN said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fiercest fighting since a truce came into effect on Sunday was in and around Debaltseve, a strategic rail hub, before Ukrainian forces withdrew on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Reuters witness saw a tank emblazoned with the words 'Good Wolf' firing from a separatist checkpoint outside Vuhlehirsk, a frontline town near Debaltseve, indicating fighting had not ceased completely in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>French president Francois Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel called for the "Minsk II" ceasefire deal in Ukraine to be "fully respected" after meeting in Paris on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The ceasefire has been violated several times. It must now be fully respected along the entire front line," Mr Hollande told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A ceasefire brokered by France and Germany was signed last week in the Belarussian capital Minsk, but quickly collapsed as fighting continued between Ukrainian government and separatist forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The foreign ministers of Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine will meet in Paris on Tuesday to discuss the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Hollande and Ms Merkel said they were "even more convinced" that the only solution rested on the implementation of the latest Minsk agreement, including the withdrawal of heavy weapons and release of prisoners.</td></tr>
