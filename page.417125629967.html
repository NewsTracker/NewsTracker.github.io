<h3>Alix Tichelman pleads guilty to manslaughter in Google exec's death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Alix Tichelman arrives in the courtroom Tuesday in Santa Cruz, Calif., receiving a sentence of six years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A California prostitute charged with killing a Google executive with an overdose of heroin aboard his yacht pleaded guilty Tuesday to involuntary manslaughter and administering drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A Santa Cruz County Superior Court judge sentenced defendant Alix Tichelman to six years in prison, bringing a sudden and unexpected conclusion to a tawdry case that garnered national attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tichelman injected Forrest Timothy Hayes with heroin in November 2013 then left without seeking help when he passed out on the yacht, authorities say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hayes had hired Tichelman several times before, and they were doing drugs and having sex the night he died, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tichelman had been preparing to move out of California when she was arrested, according to authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She has wealthy parents and dual citizenship in the U.S. and Canada, attending Southridge School in Surrey, B.C., for a time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Defence attorney Larry Biggam said Tichelman, 28, was relieved to have the court proceedings behind her, and she is expected to serve three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She will be credited the year already served in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It was an accidental overdose between two consenting adults," Biggam said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The high-end call girl was arrested eight months after Hayes' death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Santa Cruz police said a surveillance video at the Santa Cruz harbor showed the woman gather her belongings, casually step over Hayes' body, finish a glass of wine and lower a blind before leaving the yacht the night before the body was discovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The video also showed Tichelman panicking and attempting to revive Hayes as he slipped into unconsciousness before leaving the yacht, Santa Cruz Deputy District Attorney Rafael Vazquez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There was an obvious reaction that showed she didn't intend to kill," Vazquez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The hearing Tuesday was scheduled to set additional proceedings, and Tichelman's plea surprised Vazquez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Vazquez began by submitting a revised complaint specifying that Tichleman's manslaughter charge was to be involuntary rather than the more severe voluntary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Then Tichelman's attorney told the court his client intended to plead guilty to all counts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Vazquez said the charges were filed over the objections of Hayes' family, who feared a public trial would further embarrass a wife and children traumatized by exposure of the Google executive's double life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Hayes was the father of five, and two of his children are in elementary school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Vazquez said none of Hayes' family attended the hearing Tuesday, but an attorney representing them did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Christine McGuire, a Santa Cruz lawyer representing the family, didn't return a phone call after the hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After Tichelman was charged in California, police in Milton, Ga., took another look at the 2013 overdose death of Tichelman's former boyfriend Dean Riopelle, 53, the owner of a popular Atlanta music venue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Authorities said a panicked Tichelman had called police, saying her boyfriend had overdosed on something and wouldn't respond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Police in Milton did not immediately return a call Tuesday seeking a possible update on the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tichelman has not been charged in that death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>An autopsy report listed Riopelle's death as an accidental overdose of heroin, oxycodone and alcohol.</td></tr>
