<h3>Apple's streaming music service may come next week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES - Apple is getting ready to announce its answer to Spotify at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco next week, according to a Wall Street Journal report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Much like its competitor, Apple's service will be priced US$10 a month for unlimited streaming; however, it looks like there won't be any ad-supported on-demand tier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Instead, Apple is looking to attract users unwilling to pay for music with a revamped version of its iTunes Radio service, which reportedly will feature stations programmed by musicians like Q-Tip, Drake and Dr. Dre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Journal notes that Apple hasn't finalized deals for its subscription service with the major record labels, so there is a chance that an announcement may be postponed until the ink on those deals is dry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple long ignored music subscription services, instead focusing on its iTunes digital download store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But with digital download sales declining and services, such as Spotify, gaining ground, the company is looking to change course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It acquired Beats Electronics for $3 billion a year ago, and as part of the deal also got its hand on the company's Beats Music subscription service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Beats Music is expected to be rolled into Apple's own service when it launches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Have you bought the Apple Watch?</td></tr>
