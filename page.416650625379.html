<h3>A barber's half-century of clipping hair in a changing Baltimore</h3>

<tr><td>2</td><td>Lenny Clay (R) sits at his barber shop in Baltimore, Maryland April 29, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lenny Clay (2nd from front) talks with other men at his barber shop in Baltimore, Maryland April 29, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lenny Clay stands outside his barbershop in Baltimore, Maryland April 29, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>BALTIMORE (Reuters) - The view from Lenny Clay's barbershop in a neighborhood just west of downtown Baltimore is bleak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Grass grows through the cracks of a broken sidewalk and weeds cover an empty lot where a row house once stood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sometimes, the teenagers on the street are just talking to their friends; sometimes they're selling drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Back in the '60s I couldn't keep the politicians out of here," Clay, now 80, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Now none of them will come."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In 1961, when Clay opened Lenny's House of Naturals in this corner storefront, the neighborhood was busy, bright, full of hard-working black families and black-owned businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And Clay's barbershop was at the center of things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His clients included prominent local and national politicians, the basketball star Earl "the Pearl" Monroe - even Oprah Winfrey, he says, came in for haircuts during the 1970s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As Clay snipped and trimmed, his clients poured out their problems and talked about the city and about civil rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In his autobiography, Monroe described Clay as "always there for me," which was why, when Monroe bought himself a Rolls Royce, he gave his Cadillac Eldorado to Clay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In the '60s, we were fighting for equality," said Sterling Brunson, 50.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Now we're fighting for survival."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>To the men who gathered at the House of Naturals Wednesday, the story of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man whose death from injuries he sustained while in police custody, was not surprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>What did surprise them was the intensity of the media attention focused on the violence that shook Baltimore Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And the men don't expect the ensuing protests to change much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After all, they noted, the much more widespread unrest in 1968 didn't lead to long-term improvements in the lives of poor, black families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Most people under 50 have never seen this before," he said of the clashes between young Baltimore residents and police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"During the '68 riots they had the National Guard on every corner. You'd see them chasing people across that lot" - he gestured out the window - "with their bayonets, and the people were carrying TVs, mattresses."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In the months that followed, some of his customers paid in pints of whiskey looted from shops during the riots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I was drinking liquor back then, and for six months after the riots every time I took a drink of liquor it tasted like smoke," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I got a lot of humor out of the riots, as bad as they were."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Another man, Jessie Bell, 69 broke in: "There was a different thing going on in the riots of '68," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"It was mostly adults back then," added Tim Bridges, who said he was five when the riots started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I was 16," said Tony Boy Sr., 63.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Bell said most of the people fighting back then, even if they participated in the looting, wanted an end to the old system of segregation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Afterward we thought it would be better," Bell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"But it got worse."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In the wake of the riots, a wide boulevard named after King was built, separating Clay's neighborhood from downtown and from the cluster of University of Maryland buildings nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That, Clay said, reduced the flow of customers to the neighborhood's businesses and drained it of its economic base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Families that could afford to moved away to the suburbs, and shops closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"All our businesses are pretty much gone," Brunson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"We had black dry cleaners, we had black barbers, we had pretty much everything known to man. Now, we've got nothing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>As Baltimore's economy declined, the men said, its poorest black residents grew more and more isolated, and their relations with police and city officials worsened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>In 2009, Clay's arm was broken when an officer threw him to the ground during a traffic stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>There were protests then, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In 2013, Baltimore paid Clay $63,000 to settle a lawsuit over the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>On Wednesday, the power in Clay's shop was out - he had forgotten to pay his electrical bill - but it didn't matter; soon the building where the shop is located will be torn down to make way for a new development and Clay will have to retire or open up somewhere else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"I wish you could make your skin black for 24 hours," he said to a reporter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"You wouldn't believe how fast you'd move to be white again."</td></tr>
