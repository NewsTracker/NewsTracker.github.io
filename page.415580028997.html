<h3>'A Little Life' a darkly beautiful tale of love and friendship</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>I became so invested in the characters and their lives that I almost felt unqualified to review this book objectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For example, less than 200 pages in, something wonderful happens to the main character, Jude St. Francis, who has already been subjected to an incredible amount of suffering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>I became nauseous with the knowledge that this precarious joy would have to collapse in the following 500 pages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I wanted so badly for Jude to remain frozen in a moment of happiness that part of me wished the book were ending with that note of hope, the light reached at the end of the tunnel - I wished, in other words, for a gentler, inferior book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead, Yanagihara records the ups and downs of Jude's life with painterly, painstaking patience, denying easy resolutions at every turn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When the novel begins, Jude has already survived his formative traumas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He and college friends JB, Malcolm and Willem have moved to New York to realize their ambitions; he has a stable existence and people who love him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>We meet him at a moment when a less exacting writer might have left him to a vague, sunny destiny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But life for Jude is a daily struggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He is overwhelmed by "the terrifying largeness, the impossibility, of the world, of the relentlessness of its minutes, its hours, its days."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His memories hound him, and he is in chronic physical pain because of a crippling injury of mysterious origin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He doesn't talk about his childhood, and he is constantly exhausted by "the thousands of little deflections and smudgings of truth, of fact, that necessitated his every interaction with the world and its inhabitants."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With endless vigilance, he hides his many secrets from his closest friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>At one point, JB dubs him the Postman: "[W]e never see him with anyone, we don't know what race he is, we don't know anything about him. Post-sexual, post-racial, post-past."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Even Willem, his most beloved, kind-hearted friend, finds that their relationship seems to require "not letting himself ask the questions he knew he ought to, because he was afraid of the answers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Yanagihara is a patient writer - she took nearly two decades to finish "The People in the Trees" while working as first a book publicist and later a magazine editor (she is an editor-at-large for Conde Nast Traveler).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And while the narrative pace of "A Little Life" never feels sluggish, we learn about Jude in careful increments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>("Friendship," thinks Willem, "was witnessing another's slow drip of miseries."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Part of the suspense of "A Little Life" lies in our discovery of Jude's horrific past, which Yanagihara reveals piece by excruciating piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>His childhood is an agonizing parade of tragedy and evil, starting with his abandonment at a monastery ("Inside a trash bag, stuffed with eggshells and old lettuce and spoiled spaghetti - and you"), where he suffers abuses at the hands of the brothers before moving on to worse and worse fates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But there is nothing lurid or gratuitous about the telling, and each piece helps us make sense of the Jude we have gotten to know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>We follow Jude and the people in his life for decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>(One of the many things Yanagihara handles well is the narrative passage of time.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He finds professional success as a fearsome litigator, and he maintains strong relationships that help him survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He is beloved and cared for - by his friends; by his doctor Andy, who acts as a surrogate older brother; by his old law school professor Harold, who acts as a surrogate father - but his well-being is always in question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Despite evidence to the contrary, he lives with the persistent belief "that he is a nothing, a scooped-out husk in which the fruit has long since mummified and shrunk, and now rattles uselessly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He keeps his secrets close to his chest, convinced that he is "a person who inspires disgust, a person meant to be hated" and that his friends will reject and despise him if they find out what happened to him, which he can't help but equate with who he is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Here lies the central conflict of this novel - can Jude overcome his shame and self-loathing and open up to his friends?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>And if he can, will they be able to help him?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It says a lot about Yanagihara's talents that this deeply contemplative, psychological, tortured material is as compelling as the plot-heavy story of Jude's past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It is also at least as upsetting, a brutal examination of the lifelong effects of trauma, of the impossibility of healing all damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"A Little Life" is not misery porn; if that's what you're looking for, you will be disappointed, denied catharsis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>There are truths here that are almost too much to bear - that hope is a qualified thing, that even love, no matter how pure and freely given, is not always enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>This book made me realize how merciful most fiction really is, even at its darkest, and it's a testament to Yanagihara's ability that she can take such ugly material and make it beautiful.</td></tr>

<h3>Dolphins decide not to match Clay's offer from Bills (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MIAMI (AP) -- Tight end Charles Clay is switching teams in the AFC East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Miami Dolphins decided Thursday against matching the contract offer Clay received from Buffalo, so he will join the Bills after signing their $38 million, five-year deal Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Dolphins had the right to match after giving Clay a transition tag two weeks ago, but they decided the price was too high and will go with newcomer Jordan Cameron and holdover Dion Sims at tight end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Miami faces salary-cap constraints after signing All-Pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh to a $114 million, six-year contract last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Even so, the Dolphins signed center J.D. Walton to a one-year contract Thursday, and hosted visits by two other free agents - quarterback Tarvaris Jackson and receiver Michael Crabtree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Walton, who will provide depth in Miami's shaky offensive line, started all 16 games for the Giants last year and has 52 career starts since being drafted by the Broncos in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He missed all of the 2013 season with an ankle injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clay started 47 games in four years with Miami after being taken in the sixth round of the 2011 draft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He had 58 catches last season for 605 yards and three scores despite knee trouble that hampered him all season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Bills made Clay one of their top free-agent targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He traveled to Buffalo by private jet on March 10, the first day of the league's signing period, and spent several days in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clay is the latest addition to a revamped offense under newly hired coach Rex Ryan and incoming coordinator Greg Roman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Buffalo acquired running back LeSean McCoy in a trade with Philadelphia on March 3, and signed free-agent receiver Percy Harvin this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Jackson's visit to Miami signals the Dolphins may replace backup quarterback Matt Moore, a free agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Moore has been with Miami since 2011 but made $4 million last year and may be too expensive to re-sign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Jackson has been in the NFL since 2006, but hasn't started a game since 2011, when he was with Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He has 34 career starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Crabtree has been a starter for the 49ers since they took him in the first round of the 2009 draft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He had 68 catches last year, averaging a career-low 10.3 yards per reception and scored only four touchdowns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Clay's departure means quarterback Ryan Tannehill has lost four of his top six targets from last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Dolphins traded disgruntled receiver Mike Wallace to the Vikings, and released Brian Hartline and Brandon Gibson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They acquired receiver Kenny Stills in a trade with the Saints.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>AP Sports Writer John Wawrow in Buffalo, New York, contributed to this report.</td></tr>
