<tr><td>7</td><td>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) - Sierra Leone's 6 million people were told to stay home for three days, except for religious services, beginning Friday as the West African nation attempted a final push to rid itself of Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As with a similar operation last year, thousands of teams will remind people how Ebola is spread and how to prevent it.</td></tr>
