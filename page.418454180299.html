<tr><td>4</td><td>1 and No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>2, respectively.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>"I've always said that if we provide an environment that is friendly to job creators, we can level the playing field with neighboring states and become a leader in exports," Martinez said in a news release Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Martinez said the rankings confirm the state's strides to diversify its economy and grow in the private sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the state had more work to do to be seen as a leader in international trade, she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to the department report, the Las Cruces area dominated other cities with an export growth of more than 210 percent in the last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That amounted to a gain of $913 million with an overall total of $1.3 billion in growth.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>A majority of the exports were to markets where the U.S. has trade agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Key exports from the state include appliances, electronic parts, plastic and rubber products and transportation equipment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The state's reach touched North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries and places in Europe and Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>New Mexico Economic Development Department Cabinet Secretary Jon Barela credited the gains to tax policy changes, trade missions and flourishing relationships with leaders in other countries.</td></tr>
