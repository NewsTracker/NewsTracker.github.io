<h3>Shares languish as weak China CPI, Greece darken outlook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TOKYO (AP) " Asian stock markets fell Tuesday, hit by a sagging Wall Street and deadlocked Greek bailout negotiations. More weak Chinese economic data further clouded the gloomy outlook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1.4 percent to 20,168.88 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.1 percent to 27,023.59.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Shanghai Composite shed 0.9 percent to 5,086.65 while South Korea's Kospi edged 0.1 percent lower to 2,062.24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.4 percent to 5,477.90.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Shares in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also were lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>GREEK DEBT: Talks between Greece and its creditors have been deadlocked since late last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rejected a proposal made by the three institutions overseeing the country's bailout: the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An agreement is needed by June 30, when Greece's emergency financing program ends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>THE QUOTE: "Against a backdrop of ongoing bond value destruction, the Greek PM's latest piece of interpretive dance, and better than expected US jobs data, markets face a turbulent week as they digest a smorgasbord of data," Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC said in a commentary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average slipped into the red for the year on Monday as stocks extended their slump, with big losses among airlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Investors remain cautious over the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark interest rate later this year for the first time since the 2009 global recession after a strong jobs report last Friday suggested that the economy is recovering from its winter slump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Dow fell 82.91 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,766.55, giving it a loss of 0.3 percent for 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 13.55 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,079.28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>CHINA FACTOR: China's inflation benchmark slipped to 1.2 percent in May from 1.5 percent the month before, signaling weak demand and continued deflationary pressures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That followed Monday's report that both imports and exports contracted again in May. The string of lackluster data is adding to pressures for further stimulus to prevent the slowdown becoming a sharp slump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 27 cents to $58.41 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It fell 99 cents Monday to close at $58.14 a barrel in New York after import data suggested a slowdown in Chinese trade, which could lead to weaker global demand for diesel, gasoline and other fuels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, rose 28 cents to $63.51 a barrel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It fell 62 cents to close at $62.69 in London on Monday.</td></tr>
