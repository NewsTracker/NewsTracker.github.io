<h3>Kenya &#039;open-minded&#039; on appeal to increase Jeptoo ban</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya "followed due process" in suspending Chicago and Boston marathon winner Rita Jeptoo for two years for doping but are "open-minded" on governing body IAAF's appeal to double the ban, Athletics Kenya chief executive Isaac Mwangi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The International Association of Athletics Federations wants the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to hand Jeptoo a harsher punishment due to "aggravating circumstances which it argues warrant an extended period of ineligibility."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jeptoo failed an out-of-competition test in September for the blood-booster EPO although she denies doping and has appealed to CAS, sport's highest court, for the suspension to be lifted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are open-minded about the matter but we shall wait for details to be able to comment further. I think we followed due process while making that decision (to suspend Rita Jeptoo for two years) and we were guided by IAAF rules," Mwangi told Reuters on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jeptoo, 34, won back-to-back Boston and Chicago titles in 2013 and 2014 -- as well as Boston in 2006 -- to top the two-year World Marathon Majors series standings last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jeptoo's case has focused attention on Kenyan athletes who are among the world's best middle and long distance runners but have failed a number of drug tests, with the sports minister saying the rise in doping had "embarrassed" the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At least 36 Kenyan athletes have failed dope tests in the past two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kenyan government officials have blamed the growing doping cases on foreign agents and AK's failure to educate its athletes properly.</td></tr>
