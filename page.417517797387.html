<h3>Google Red-Faced After PM Branded Top Criminal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google is left red-faced after India's Narendra Modi is "unexpectedly" put in the same category as Osama bin Laden and Al Capone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google has apologised after photos of India's Prime Minister began appearing in image search results for "top 10 criminals".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Narendra Modi's face appears alongside al Qaeda chiefs Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri, as well as American gangster Al Capone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After many politicians and commentators began expressing concern on social media, Google apologised for "any misunderstanding or confusion".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A spokesperson for the search engine told Sky News: "These results trouble us and are not reflective of the opinions of Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Sometimes, the way images are described on the internet can yield surprising results to specific queries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We apologise for any confusion or misunderstanding this has caused. We're continually working to improve our algorithms to prevent unexpected results like this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is thought the search result was caused by numerous news stories on Mr Modi's statements about politicians with criminal backgrounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Another explanation was that a British newspaper published an image of the PM with incorrect metadata.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said it would take up the matter with Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>All India Congress national spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi tweeted: "Hey @google the Indian Prime Min listed in #Top10Criminals really? Time u changed ur algorithm,this is just so wrong."</td></tr>
