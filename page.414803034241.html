<h3>Death of Ozgecan Aslan stokes anger over Turkey's violence against women</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Despite a surge in violence against women in Turkey last year, the particularly brutal, and public, attack on Ozgecan Aslan, 20, has become a rallying point, prompting protests and condemnation by politicians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police say she was travelling home on a minibus in the southeastern seaside province of Mersin on Wednesday when a man tried to rape her, according to reports carried widely in Turkish media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Thousands members of Turkey's Bar Associations with one holding a poster of Ozgecan Aslan, in Mersin, Turkey, march to the parliament in Ankara, Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Raped & Killed We will not forget you #OzgecanAslan RIP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When she retaliated with pepper spray, the suspect stabbed her and beat her to death with an iron bar before enlisting his father and a friend to help dispose of her body by burning it and dumping it in a river.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A 26-year-old man has been arrested with his accomplices, Hurriyet Daily News reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prosecutors were not immediately available for comment, police could give no more details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Its the religion you force down our throats that demeans women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Women nationwide have worn black in condemnation of the murder, posting photos on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The hashtag #sendeanlat, meaning "you tell us too" was trending globally on Sunday with women sharing stories of abuse on public transport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>#OzgecanAslan continued to trend worldwide on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Several hundred minibuses in Diyarbakir in the southeast were adorned with black ribbons and carried Aslan's photograph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>President Tayyip Erdogan and his wife called Aslan's family on Saturday, when her funeral was held, and Mr Erdogan's two daughters have visited the family's house, according to the pro-government Daily Sabah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I will personally follow the case so that they will be given the heaviest penalty. I am already following the case. Violence against women is the bleeding wound of our country," Mr Erodgan said during a speech in Ankara on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Erdogan, a devout Sunni in the patriarchal Muslim majority nation, has in the past been criticised by women's groups for failing to speak out more domestic violence, and for saying he does not believe in equality of the sexes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Human rights monitor Bianet says 281 women were murdered in Turkey in 2014, a 31 per cent increase on the previous year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nine per cent of these had asked for protection from the state, it said, prompting criticism that not enough is being done to protect victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Some politicians called for the reintroduction of the death penalty in response to the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Istanbul Feminist Collective rejected that at as a way of preventing such attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"(M)ost of the discussions do not give any hope of improvement in this respect because political actors or groups, the government in particular, are reluctant to recognise their responsibility in Ozgecan's murder," it said, arguing that those calling for the death penalty fail to act when violence against women is committed.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt conducts second wave of strikes against Islamic State in Libya in retaliation for mass beheading of Christians</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The men were killed by a group claiming affiliation with Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Beirut: Egypt conducted a second wave of air strikes against the Islamic State in Libya in retaliation for the massacre of 21 Egyptian Christians who were lined up on Libya's Mediterranean coast and beheaded, marking a horrifying expansion of the jihadist group's activities outside Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Calling for an international coalition to confront the insurgency on its border, Egypt confirmed it had conducted raids in the IS-stronghold of Derna, in Libya's east, backed by Libya's air force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Libya's Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni also issued a plea for Western military intervention as the country's already dire security situation slipped further into chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An Egyptian air force fighter jet lands at an undisclosed location in Egypt following air strikes in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We have absolutely confirmed information that al-Qaeda and IS are in Tripoli and . . . near Ben Jawad" on the country's central coastline, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I ask world powers stand by Libya and launch military strikes against these groups," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This threat will move to European countries, especially Italy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At least 64 militants were killed in Egypt's attacks, Libyan Air Force commander Saqer al-Joroushi told Egyptian state television, indicating further air strikes were planned for Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This video image from aerial footage released by the Egyptian Defence Ministry shows an air strike on a Islamic State position in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Local residents say civilians also died in the air strikes, although it was not possible to confirm these casualties before publication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Coptic labourers were kidnapped by Islamic State militants in Sirt, on Libya's coast, in two attacks in December and January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In what has become a hideously familiar pattern, the slickly-produced IS video shows the hostages, dressed in orange jumpsuits, being simultaneously beheaded by their individual executioners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Striking back ... Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi continues to target Islamic State jihadists in Libya after they beheaded 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This time, the video ends with both a broad threat to the West and a specific threat to Italy, which lies just across the Mediterranean from Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Italy says it is already deeply concerned about the growing numbers of desperate asylum seekers attempting to cross into Italy from the coast of Libya - more than 2000 were rescued just this weekend alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Grief ... A man is comforted as he mourns the Egyptian Coptic Christians who were captured in Libya and beheaded by Islamic State jihadists, outside of the Virgin Mary church in the village of el-Aour, Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Describing the Islamic State as just "350 kilometres from our shore," Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti told the newspaper Il Messaggero that Italy was ready to send more than 5000 soldiers under a United Nations mandate to stop IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We've been discussing it for months, but now the need for intervention has become urgent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The brutal deaths of the Egyptian Christians comes just months after a group of Libyan jihadists made their October pledge of allegiance to IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>By November the self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, confirmed the expansion of IS into Libya in a recording released online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Libya's internationally recognised Prime Minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, has issued a plea for Western military intervention against Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Engulfed in a crisis that has crippled the country's parliament and economy and fuelled the growth of rival governments, armies and militia, Libya is now one of IS's fastest-growing new franchises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Up to 3000 people have been killed in Libya in the last 14 months as rival groups battle across multiple fronts for territory, legitimacy and power, creating perfect conditions for jihadist groups like IS to gain a foothold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>For Egypt, already fighting a terrorist insurgency in north Sinai against an IS-affiliated militia, the dangers of being drawn into the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Libya are enormous, analysts say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>If Egypt progresses from air strikes to troop deployment along its border with Libya, it would be opening a second front in its fight against terrorism, overstretching its military and drawing resources away from Sinai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"[IS] will have hoped to provoke [Egyptian] airstrikes in Libya," Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Centre whose research focuses on IS tweeted on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"This fits perfectly its vision of escalating conflict and chaos in the region."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Others warned that Egyptian military intervention could undermine both Egypt and Libya's prospects for stability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The strength of the Islamists in the east should not be underestimated," say Karim Mezran and Tarek Radwan from the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Centre for the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"They are very capable of holding their territory and could begin heavy guerrilla warfare against what at that point could easily and justifiably be portrayed as foreign 'invaders'."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has waged his own ferocious security crackdown against the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, described the deaths of the 21 Copts as an "abhorrent act of terrorism".</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He warned: "Egypt and the entire world face a fierce battle against terrorist organisations that are bound by the same extremist thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"We must therefore stand united to root it out and protect the world from the proliferation of this toxic menace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>At the heart of Libya's meltdown, which began soon after its 2011 revolution forced the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi (he was later killed by an angry mob), is its competing governments and the militia who back them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The official, internationally-recognised government moved from the capital Tripoli to Tobruk in August last year after a spate of kidnappings, arrests and killings drove politicians to seek a safer haven in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The group behind that violence, Libya Dawn, is a loose coalition of Islamist militias including former al-Qaeda jihadists, tribal militia and some of the country's Muslim Brotherhood members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Despite a requirement that they step down after the June 2014 election, members of the previous Libyan parliament - dominated by supporters of Libya Dawn - continues to sit in the capital Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>And while the government in Tobruk supports Egypt's military intervention, the unofficial government in Tripoli does not, describing it as an assault on Libya's sovereignty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The forces controlled by General Khalifa Haftar, a former Gaddafi-era officer, are backing the official government in Tobruk and doing battle against Libya Dawn across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>His fighters are mainly drawn from those seeking greater autonomy for the eastern region of Cyrenaica, as well as tribal fighters and former military officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The Libyan National Army, as General Haftar calls it, is financed by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, analysts say, while Libya Dawn is backed by Qatar and Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>With at least 100,000 more Egyptians believed to be in Libya - like those who were murdered, they are labourers seeking work outside Egypt's decimated economy - the government has also committed to helping them return to Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>There are already reports that at least 35 Egyptians have been kidnapped in areas controlled by Ansar al-Sharia and IS, local media reported overnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>In the meantime, Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs has travelled to New York to hold talks on Libya with the United Nations Security Council.</td></tr>
