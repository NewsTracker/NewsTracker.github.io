<tr><td>2</td><td>Uber's spokesman for Mexico and Central America says the company doesn't mind paying 1.5 percent of the proceeds from each ride into a transport-improvement fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Luis De Uriarte says Uber hopes the fund will help improve conditions for pedestrians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The city's medallion taxis groused Thursday they hadn't been advised before the rules were issued Wednesday.</td></tr>
