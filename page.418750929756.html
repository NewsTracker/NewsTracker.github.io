<tr><td>11</td><td>Empty storefronts are again a feature of Greece's towns and cities as spending dries up in a crisis that put Greece's future in the euro in doubt.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>"We won't recover for another 50 years."</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>The cost has been huge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A million jobs, mostly in the private sector, have been lost since then - around a fifth of the country's workforce.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>At last count, unemployment was still over 25 percent and more than 50 percent for the under-25s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Alongside the capital controls, the government imposed a new round of austerity, raising sales taxes and levies on businesses, while maintaining emergency taxes on households that have eaten up disposable incomes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Early Thursday, parliament approved a second round of measures demanded by rescue creditors for a new bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Retail associations fear a return to the peak levels of unemployment around 2012 when they were hit by a surge of business failures.</td></tr>
