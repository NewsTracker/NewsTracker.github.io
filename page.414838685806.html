<h3>Suns' Gorringe set for utility role</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Four months after his proposed trade to the Power fell through, Gorringe looks set to be played through the midfield for the Suns in a utility role similar to that of Port's roving tall Justin Westhoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With Zac Smith, Tom Nicholls and Charlie Dixon well ahead of him in Gold Coast's ruck pecking order, the 199cm Gorringe was played on the wing during a match simulation session on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Suns coach Rodney Eade said the 22-year-old can expect to play "multiple positions" this season, just like Westhoff does to damaging effect for Port Adelaide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Having a utility who's got some talent like that is very rare in the competition," Eade said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Westhoff can do it, but there's not many who can play multiple positions at that height.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We're going to try him (in midfield) at stages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He can play tall forward - not the tallest forward, not as in the Dixon/Lynch mould, but certainly our third tall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He can give us coverage in the ruck, he's a very good athlete so he can play on the wing ... (and) maybe as a third tall defender."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gorringe sought a move back to Adelaide, his hometown, during last year's trade period but Port were unable to complete a deal as they focused on securing Paddy Ryder from Essendon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After declaring he was "lied to" and "let down" by the Power, Gorringe has resolved to prove himself under new coach Eade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Gold Coast's NAB Challenge campaign begins on March 1 against Geelong at Townsville's Tony Ireland Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Suns have a lengthy injury list with the likes of Gary Ablett (shoulder), Steven May (knee) and Sam Day (calf) not to feature until their second pre-season clash against GWS a week later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We'll probably have about 34 to pick from for NAB one," Eade said.</td></tr>

<h3>Report: Islamic State Militants Burn 45 People To Death In Iraq</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The motive was unknown but Colonel Qasim al-Obeidi said on February 17 he believed some of the victims were members of the security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said a compound that houses the families of security personnel and local officials was now under attack, and pleaded for help from the government and international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report could not be immediately confirmed due to the fighting and the poor communications in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>IS fighters captured much of the town of Al-Baghdadi, near Ain al-Asad air base, last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Militants subsequently attacked the base on February 13, but the attack was repelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>U.S. and Iraqi officials said eight militants were killed in that attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some 300 U.S. military personnel have been training Iraqi troops at the base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Earlier this month, IS posted a video showing militants burning alive a Jordanian air force pilot, whose plane crashed in Syria in December.</td></tr>
