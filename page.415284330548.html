<h3>Egypt carries out hanging over violence after Morsi's ousting</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of Morsi's supporters have been sentenced to death after speedy mass trials, which the United Nations has described as "unprecedented in recent history".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mahmoud Ramadan, who was hanged at 7:00 am local time, was the "first to be executed of those involved in violent clashes", ministry spokesman Hani Abdel Latif said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A court in Egypt's second city Alexandria sentenced Ramadan to death in 2014 after convicting him of throwing youths off an apartment block, killing one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was among dozens of people tried over deadly violence in the city's Sidi Gaber neighbourhood on July 5, 2013, two days after Morsi's ousting by then army chief and now president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The prison authority carried out the hanging of Mahmoud Ramadan, accused of throwing children from the roof of a building in Alexandria during violent clashes organised by the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood," the interior ministry said on its Facebook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The unrest on that day came as Morsi's supporters and opponents held rival demonstrations across the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Amateur video footage of the protests had gone viral on the internet, with prosecutors using it as evidence in the case involving Ramadan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In one scene, a bearded Ramadan in a white vest and black trousers is walking on the roof of a building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Four youths are seen cowering on top of a structure there that appears to be a water tank as the man identified as Ramadan and others throw stones at them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Minutes later two youngsters fall off the structure onto the roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In separate footage, aired by a private television channel after his alleged confession, Ramadan says: "When I appear before the prosecution, I will demand to be executed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A government crackdown on Morsi's supporters killed hundreds, with thousands more arrested and tried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The ousted president is himself facing multiple trials on charges that carry the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Many of the prosecutions have been in mass trials, which then UN human rights chief Navi Pillay described last June as "obscene and a complete travesty of justice".</td></tr>
