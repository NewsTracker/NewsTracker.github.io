<h3>CANNES WATCH: Star-studded Calvin Klein event honors women</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES (AP) - The star-studded Calvin Klein Women in Film soiree could not have come at a more appropriate moment - at a Cannes Film Festival where the dearth of women directors has been a major theme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The gilded guest list of top actresses used the glamorous event on the grounds of a private mansion to speak out about equality - and perhaps show off their designer clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Emily Blunt looked ravishing in a figure-hugging cream sheath - and struck a cynical tone on the cinema landscape parity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You'll have a hit movie that women are at the forefront of and people are like 'Oh, it's all changing.' And then I feel like it resorts back to what it was before ... But I do feel that things are changing," said Blunt, who stars in "Sicario," one of the 19 films competing this year for Cannes' top prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rachel Weisz called it "very sad that an event like tonight has to happen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We make up 51 percent of planet Earth and we're just very disproportionately represented, in terms of directors and writers - the people in charge of the storytelling. So we just need more films from women's points of view," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>French actress Melanie Laurent, who's been cast in Angelina Jolie's next directorial effort "By The Sea," lavished praise on her boss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Yes, another great female director. She's amazing, everything is so simple with her and I still can't believe she chose me," said Laurent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Others, like jury member Sienna Miller, used the evening to express how the experience of the Cannes Film Festival has affected them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's completely reignited a passion. I don't watch enough films and I think I'll be watching a lot more, because I'm absolutely loving it, seeing that much cinema," said Miller, who shimmered in a pearl silky gown with sporty straps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Also at the event was Miller's fellow Cannes jury member, actor Jake Gyllenhaal, French actress Isabelle Huppert, as well as models Natalia Vodianova and Doutzen Kroes.</td></tr>
