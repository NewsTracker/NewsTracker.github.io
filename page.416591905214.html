<h3>Boko Haram battle: Nigerian army rescues 200 girls, 93 women</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Nigerian military pose with a flag of Boko Haram earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Abuja: Nigeria's military is claiming the rescue of 200 girls and 93 women from a notorious Boko Haram stronghold, but there is no confirmation the hostages are those kidnapped from Chibok a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Troops have captured & destroyed three camps of terrorists inside the Sambisa forest & rescued 200 girls & 93 women," defence spokesman Chris Olukolade said in a text message, referring to the area in northeast Borno state where the Islamists have bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It is not yet confirmed if the girls are the Chibok girls. The freed persons are now being screened & profiled."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's unclear yet whether the girls rescued by the Nigerian army include the girls who were kidnapped from Chibok last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Olukolade gave no indication as to how long it would take for the hostages to be identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Boko Haram claimed the abduction of 276 girls from a secondary school in Chibok, also in Borno, on April 14 of last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Fifty-seven girls escaped within hours of the attack but 219 remained in captivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the weeks following the mass abduction, Nigerian security sources and locals in Borno said there were indications the girls had been taken to the Sambisa Forest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But defence officials and experts agreed that they were likely separated over the last 13 months, casting significant doubt on the possibility that they were being held together as a group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, vowed to "marry them off" or sell them as "slaves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Chibok attack brought unprecedented world attention to the Nigeria's Islamist uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Boko Haram has also been blamed for hundreds of other kidnappings, especially targeting women and girls across northeast Nigeria.</td></tr>
