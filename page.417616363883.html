<h3>John Oliver keeps FIFA promise, chugs Bud Light Lime on show</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Unfortunately for John Oliver, he's a man of his word.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>During the previous episode of HBO's "Last Week Tonight," Oliver pleaded with FIFA sponsors - specifically Budweiser, Adidas and McDonald's - to help make Sepp Blatter go away amid FIFA's corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Budweiser, if you pull your support and help get rid of Blatter, I will put my mouth where my mouth is and I will personally drink one of your disgusting items," the host said, while adding that he would wear one of Adidas' "ugly shoes" and take a bite out of every item on McDonald's dollar menu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Then on June 2, the FIFA president stunned many, including Oliver, by announcing that he would resign, just days after his re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Sunday night's show, Oliver pointed out that although it's unclear if the sponsors really had anything to do with Blatter stepping down, "a promise is a promise."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The host then pointed toward his feet to reveal that he was sporting the Adidas sneakers and then proceeded to chomp down on all of the dollar menu items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Oliver knew what the main event was - and the studio audience cheered as he chugged an entire Bud Light Lime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Bud Light Lime may taste like your tongue is angry with you," Oliver said, "but after Sepp Blatter leaving, to me it tastes delicious."</td></tr>
