<h3>Woods gets hot after bad start, shoots 68 at Quicken Loans (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GAINESVILLE, Va.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Tiger Woods took a conservative 3-wood off the first hole Thursday in the Quicken Loans National when many players were hitting driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>No matter - he still pull-hooked it into the gallery, hit his second shot into a greenside bunker and lipped out a 5-footer for par before slamming his putter against his bag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On the third hole, he missed the green well left and had to get up-and-down for bogey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A three-putt on No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>4 left him 3 over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was his final bogey of the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Woods got a fortunate deflection off a marshal left of the green on the par-5 fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He apologized, handed out an autographed glove and made his first birdie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Then he ran off five birdies in six holes around the turn for a 3-under 68.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That left him five shots behind leaders Retief Goosen and Ryo Ishikawa at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Woods said it was the first time since the Masters in April that he's turned a bad round into a good one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''That's what scoring is all about,'' Woods said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I made a lot of key putts today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I ran them by the hole but I made all the comebacks, and overall I felt like I hit the ball well enough to turn it around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Woods is the host of the Quicken Loans National, which he won in 2009 and 2012 at Congressional in Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The last of his 79 PGA Tour victories was nearly two years ago, and he has plummeted to 266th in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Woods got up-and-down from a greenside bunker for birdie on the par-5 eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He made a 9-footer on 10 and a 7-footer on 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He hit his approach to tap-in range on 12, the most difficult hole on the course, and ended the run with a 12-footer on 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He two-putted for par on the final five holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The 68 was only his sixth round under 70 this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He has had three scores of 80 or higher and has missed three cuts and withdrawn once in eight events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In soft conditions with little wind, Woods' 68 was only good for a tie for 27th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Players were allowed to lift, clean and place their golf balls on the rain-softened fairways, and 81 of them managed to break par.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''We got the fresh greens tomorrow,'' said Woods, who played in the afternoon after a 95-minute rain delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>RTJ is welcoming a regular PGA Tour event for the first time after hosting four Presidents Cups, most recently in 2005, and experience seemed to help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Goosen, who played in two of those events, had a bogey-free 63.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Presidents Cup veterans Ernie Els and Justin Leonard were one shot back, along with Kevin Chappell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Goosen, a 46-year-old two-time major champion, is finally feeling healthy after major back surgery in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Always stoic on the course, he still has plenty of passion for the game, which he showed by qualifying for both the U.S. Open and the British Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''I'm lucky to be out here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Three, four years ago my career looked like it was at an end,'' said Goosen, whose last victory was in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''I'm just glad I'm still out there and playing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Ishikawa, who started on the back nine, ran off six birdies in a row starting on the 14th hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Then he made a hole-in-one on the 180-yard fourth, spinning an 8-iron 15 feet back into the cup for his first competitive ace in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>At that point he was 8 under with five holes to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He parred the last five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''It took about two holes to make myself calm,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>''No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Defending champion Justin Rose, the highest-ranked player in the field, was three shots back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>So was Ollie Schneiderjans, making his second professional start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Rickie Fowler also made an ace, kicking a 7-iron off the fringe and into the cup on the 184-yard ninth, his final hole of the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>He was four shots back after a 67 that could have been much better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Fowler said his putter went cold after his victory at the Scottish Open, and on Thursday he missed four birdie putts from inside 15 feet in a five-hole stretch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Three of his four birdies were from inside 4 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Honoring a club golf tradition, he bought beer for the media to toast his hole-in-one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>''I hit a great shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Get a little bit of a good kick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Hey, we'll take it,'' Fowler said.</td></tr>
