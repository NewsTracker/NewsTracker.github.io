<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO - Egypt's Cabinet has decided to rename a square where security forces broke up a pro-Islamist sit-in two years ago in honor of the country's chief prosecutor, who was assassinated last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The decision Wednesday names the square after Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat, who was killed on June 29 by a massive car bomb in Cairo.</td></tr>
