<h3>White House: No sign of Islamic State link to Yemen attacks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. is still investigating the claim of responsibility by the Yemeni branch of Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the U.S. is looking to see whether IS has a command-and-control structure that would enable it to coordinate the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Earnest also said IS often claims responsibility for attacks purely for propaganda value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Still, he said the attack shows that everyone in the region - including Muslims - is in danger from IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earnest said there's also no clear evidence backing up the IS claim of responsibility for another deadly attack in Tunisia this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council, said the U.S condemns the attacks and also condemns airstrikes Thursday that targeted Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The airstrikes by forces loyal to Yemen's former president missed his palace and Hadi was unharmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meehan said the U.S. is calling on all sides in Yemen to return to political talks to resolve differences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She said all of Yemen's diverse communities must take part in a peaceful democratic process.</td></tr>

<h3>French court orders ex-employee to hand back Picasso works</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Pierre Le Guennec, 75, a retired electrician, and his wife Danielle, 71, were given a suspended sentence of two years in prison for handling stolen goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They were also ordered to hand over the 271 works, estimated at between 60-120 million euros ($64-$128 million), to the heirs of Picasso, who died in 1973.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Le Guennec, employed by Picasso in his last home in Mougins in southeast France, told the court in Grasse that Jacqueline Picasso offered him the box containing unsigned collages, sketches and paintings with the consent of her husband in either 1971 or 1972.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"One night, Madame called me in the hallway as I was leaving and told me, 'This is for you'," he testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The box sat in Le Guennec's garage for nearly 40 years before the couple brought it to Paris to be appraised in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After the discovery of the cache, Picasso's heirs contacted authorities who opened an investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One of Picasso's sons, Claude Ruiz Picasso, said he was satisfied with the ruling and said the collection, believed to have been created between 1900 and 1932, included important works and could now be exhibited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He's got a lot of cheek to try and make us swallow this story," Maya Picasso, one of the artist's daughters, told reporters.</td></tr>
