<h3>John Oliver grills Edward Snowden</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden got into a contentious exchange with comedian and late night host John Oliver over the ramifications of his wide-ranging leaks about America's surveillance apparatus during an interview aired on Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"How many of those documents have you actually read?" he asked Snowden, during a sit-down interview on his show Last Week Tonight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I've evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive," Snowden replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You've read every single one?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Well, I do understand what I've turned over," Snowden said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There's a difference between understanding what's in the documents and reading what's in the documents," Oliver replied, joking that "the last thing you'd want to do is read" thousands of complicated NSA documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Snowden noted that he was no longer in possession of the leaked files, and that they had been passed along to journalists who were now analyzing them and deciding how to report on the contents of the documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Oliver was skeptical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"So the New York Times took a slide, didn't redact it properly, and in the end it was possible for people to see that something was being used in Mosul on al Qaeda," Oliver said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"That is a problem," Snowden replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Well, that's a fuckup," said Oliver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It is a fuckup, and those things do happen in reporting," Snowden said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Right. But you have to own that then," Oliver said, to a surprised Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"You're giving documents with information you know could be harmful, which could get out there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"You will never be completely free from risk if you if you're free. The only time you can be free from risk are if you're in prison," Snowden said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Snowden's appearance on the show comes as the surveillance programs he revealed receive new attention in Washington.</td></tr>
