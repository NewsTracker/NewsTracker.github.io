<h3>Surge in voter turnout gives blacks new voice in Ferguson, Missouri</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After months of street protests, turnout in Tuesday's vote was 30 percent, or more than double recent municipal elections in the St. Louis suburb, which is two-thirds black but has had only two African-American council members in its 120 year history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mayor James Knowles on Wednesday called the election a "milestone" for the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The six-member city council will be split with three African-American and three white members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mayor Knowles, who is white, also has a vote on city issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ferguson became the center of a national debate over race relations after a white officer fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, in a confrontation in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"People had an opportunity to run for office, debate the issues, vote and participate in the democratic process and now it is time to move forward," Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The council meets for the first time with the new members on April 21 and faces several tasks including hiring a new city manager and municipal judge to replace officials who resigned after the Justice Department released a scathing report in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The department's report outlined years of racially based abuses in police and court practices and demanded changes, buttressing complaints from African-American residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Knowles said the city hopes to have at least the outline of an agreement on the Justice Department's demands by next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The new city manager also will have to hire a replacement for police Chief Thomas Jackson, who resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The three candidates elected on Tuesday were Ella Jones, an African-American professor; Wesley Bell, an African-American judge; and former Ferguson mayor Brian Fletcher, who is white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Council member Dwayne James is also black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some advocates said they were pleased by the high turnout, but questioned whether the new council makeup will be effective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Many activists favored defeated candidates and also noted that Knowles, who some said should be ousted, votes on city issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Hopefully the new electeds will hold the city to a higher standard with regards to listening and acting on behalf of the under-represented," said state Representative Courtney Curtis, an African-American Ferguson resident.</td></tr>
