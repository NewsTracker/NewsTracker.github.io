<h3>Georgia man pleads guilty to seeking to join Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>AUGUSTA, Ga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - Leon Nathan Davis had a family and a sales job - and says he left them behind last fall with a one-way ticket overseas and a plan to join the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 37-year-old Augusta, Georgia, man pleaded guilty Wednesday in U.S. District Court to a charge of attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Davis faces up to 15 years in federal prison and a fine of up to $250,000 when a judge sentences him at a later date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During his 30-minute plea hearing, Davis told a judge he bought a one-way ticket to fly from Atlanta to Turkey last October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I was to be smuggled into Syria and at that point in time join ISIS," said Davis, a stocky, pale man with a shaved head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>What isn't clear is why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Davis never spoke about his motivations in court, and the judge never asked about them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Davis did mention that he married within the past two years and has a stepdaughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Before his arrest Oct. 24 while checking in for his flight at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Davis said, he worked as a salesman for a company that sells mail-order medical supplements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Davis' defense attorney, Michael Loebl, declined to comment further after the plea hearing, as did prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A woman who answered the door Wednesday evening at a listed address for Davis' mother slammed the door shut when a reporter introduced himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Davis is among several dozen people charged in the past year with trying to fight alongside the Islamic State and other militants or with lending them material support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Federal charges against him were filed Wednesday just before his plea hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Charging documents say Davis is also known by the names Abdul Wakil Khalil and Abu Hurairah Al Amreekee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Georgia Department of Corrections records show he was imprisoned in October 2005 after being sentenced to 10 years for cocaine trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He was released in September 2008, but returned to prison for more than a year starting in February 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Federal authorities began watching Davis more than a year ago after he tried to contact Islamic State members through social media, FBI agent Gutis Zunde testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said Davis booked a flight to Turkey online last fall and traveled to Atlanta's airport to catch his plane Oct. 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Authorities arrested Davis at the Delta Air Lines check-in counter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Zunde said Davis later told investigators he expected to teach English to other Islamic State members once he reached Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"He said he wasn't sure if he would be a fighter or possibly a recruiter for them," Zunde said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Prosecutors had held Davis since February on a charge of illegal firearms possession by a convicted felon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They said he owned six rifles, four handguns and two shotguns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The judge said prosecutors now plan to drop that charge.</td></tr>
