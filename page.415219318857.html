<h3>Embattled Hillary Clinton urges State Department to release emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the State Department will move immediately to review e-mails that Hillary Clinton wrote on her personal account when she held his job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But in appearance before reporters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, he says that will take time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Wednesday, Clinton broke her silence over a budding controversy involving her use of personal e-mail for work when she was secretary of state, saying she wanted the U.S. State Department to release them swiftly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I want the public to see my email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>I asked State to release them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Answering a question, Kerry said, " ... we will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The secretary had been asked whether the department should scrutinize e-mails outside those already provided by Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kerry said he thought the department had all the e-mails related to the State Department, but that he would check.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The controversy has suddenly put Clinton into trouble just as she is planning to launch a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It has prompted some Democrats to wonder whether someone else should be their candidate to succeed President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton is alleged to have inappropriately used her personal e-mail for work while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I want the public to see my email," Clinton said in a tweet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clinton's tweeted statement came hours after a congressional committee investigating the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>11, 2012, attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, issued subpoenas for her emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The U.S. House of Representatives' Select Committee on Benghazi demanded all communications from Clinton related to the incident, in which a U.S. ambassador was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The panel also sent letters to Internet companies telling them to protect any documents relevant to the ongoing investigation, Jamal Ware, communications director for the Benghazi committee, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Representative Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the Benghazi panel, told reporters that within two weeks, he must either have the documents or a "really good explanation" for why not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Republicans have been scrutinizing Clinton's actions and communications surrounding the Benghazi attack, when ambassador Chris Stevens and three others were killed during an assault on a U.S. facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Republican lawmakers believe she did not do enough to ensure the safety of Americans in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi committee, said the Republicans' actions have led him to believe they simply want to attack Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He noted that Colin Powell, the secretary of state under former President George W. Bush, a Republican, had used personal e-mails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The State Department has defended Clinton, saying that at the time there was no prohibition on using a personal e-mail account for official business as long as it was preserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The State Department said Clinton last year turned over e-mails from the period after a records request and that 300 of these were sent to the Benghazi committee.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, said he believed "the sole use of a private e-mail account by a high-level official to transact government business is plainly inconsistent with the Federal Records Act and longstanding policies of the National Archives."</td></tr>

<h3>UK weather sees with temperatures hitting 16C?this weekend</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>By this time last year, she had painted the country in an array of spring colours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This year, however, experts reckon she's running two weeks behind - the evidence of which can be seen in these pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The good news is, all that could change this weekend as the sun comes out and temperatures leap into the 60s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Twelve months ago flowers were already in full bloom, blossom was on the trees and wildlife was coming out of hibernation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But last month's bitter cold snap has slowed things down this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The contrast was noticed at the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last year the ground was already clothed in bright yellow and purple crocuses after a mild winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This year only a few flowers poke their heads above the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Colin Crosbie, curator at RHS Wisley, said: 'We think we are probably about two weeks behind where we were last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It has been a colder winter, the soil has been cooler and it has slowed everything down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Woodland Trust, which monitors the first signs of spring, said wildlife is also emerging slowly this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Their volunteers have recorded only half the number of ladybirds they saw in March 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The average temperature in England for December, January and February this year was 4.4C - well below last year's 5.8C.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But that could all change in the next few days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Thermometers could nudge past 17C (63F) on Saturday as a tropical mass of air arrives from the Caribbean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>National Trust wildlife specialist Matthew Oates said the slower spring is positive for many species, which need time to hibernate properly before they emerge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If butterflies, and small mammals awake too early, they tend to suffer later if the weather turns cold again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile, England is set to be hotter than Athens, Corfu and Istanbul this weekend as temperatures are expected to soar as high as 16C in a bumper start to spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Temperatures are set to increase as the week goes on and eventually peak on Saturday, where parts of the country are forecast to be warmer than many Mediterranean holiday spots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Much of the country has today seen a bright and sunny day as spring finally arrived, with tomorrow expected to be a dry, but cloudier day, with temperatures rising to 12C.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The fine weather will continue in the south on Friday, but Scotland will see rain in the west and gale force gusts of up to 60mph in the north west.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The weekend is set to be dry, with bright spells in south and south east England, with temperatures rising to 15C and possibly 16C in sheltered spots, but the rain will continue in western Scotland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sunday will be slightly cooler, but another dry day with a good amount of sunny spells.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There may be light showers in England and Wales later in the afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'The temperatures will get warmer as the week goes on,' said Dan Williams, of the Met Office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The warm weather will coincide with breezes of 20 - 30mph but temperatures will significantly exceed the average 10C for this time of year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Meanwhile, the early bursts of spring sunshine and a mild winter have seen this year's first crop of strawberries arrive a week early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The first homegrown strawberries of 2015 will arrive in supermarkets tomorrow - days ahead of schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Experts say fine weather with good levels of sunshine this week on top of a generally mild winter have helped growers produce the early fruit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>And with temperatures set to reach 16C this weekend, the arrival of the strawberries at Tesco stores is a clear sign that spring is around the corner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Traditionally, the earliest home grown strawberries come from either Kent, Sussex or Hampshire but this year growers in Wales have won the race to produce the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Tesco berry buyer Harriet Turnbull said: 'This is a real coup for Wales which only began growing strawberries on a commercial scale two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The variety of the Welsh-grown strawberries is called Driscoll's Lusa and has been selected because of its consistent, sweet taste.</td></tr>
