<h3>Police searching Houston home of millionaire Robert Durst</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Durst was rebooked on charges of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance, a small amount of marijuana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Robert Durst is transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment in New Orleans, Tuesday, March 17, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>HOUSTON (AP) - Police on Tuesday were searching the Houston home of millionaire Robert Durst after his arrest over the weekend in New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Durst, 71, is charged with murder in a Los Angeles killing 15 years ago, and has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In 2003, he was acquitted of murder in a dismemberment death in Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Tuesday afternoon, a marked Houston police car and several unmarked cars were in front of a 17-story Houston building where Durst has three condominiums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Houston police and the Harris County district attorney's referred questions to the Los Angeles Police Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Harris County district attorney spokesman Jeff McShan said LAPD contacted his office last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>McShan would not elaborate on what was discussed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>LAPD Sgt. Barry Montgomery, a spokesman for the department, said the department is not commenting on the case until Durst is in their custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This is an investigation that's being handled by multi-jurisdictions," Montgomery said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"At this juncture the only thing the LAPD is doing is waiting for the extradition. We are just waiting on him to make it into our custody."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In a documentary about Durst's troubled life, he mumbled about how he "killed them all," providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Analysis linking a letter Durst wrote to his friend Susan Berman a year before her killing with one he said "only the killer could have written" to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Durst was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him late Monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver and carrying a weapon while possessing pot when he was arrested Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It was not clear how soon he would be returned to California.</td></tr>
