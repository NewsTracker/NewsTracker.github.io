<h3>Poland to comply with EU court ruling over CIA secret prison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It comes after the European Court of Human Rights upheld a ruling last July that Poland hosted a secret prison and must quickly end a criminal investigation into whether Warsaw officials were guilty of allowing the jail to operate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The court's decision will heap pressure on other European countries to end years of secrecy about their involvement in the CIA's global programme of secret detentions after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.</td></tr>
