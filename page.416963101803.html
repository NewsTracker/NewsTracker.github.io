<h3>Ferguson shooting's witnesses denied bond-reduction request on charges of resisting arrest</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. LOUIS - A key witness in the Michael Brown shooting death is freed on reduced bond six days after being charged with resisting arrest during another confrontation with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Twenty-three-year-old Dorian Johnson's payment Wednesday of the required $100 to cover the $1,000 bond came just hours after a St. Louis judge reduced the bond from one that required Johnson to come up with $1,000 cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Online court records earlier Wednesday showed that a judge on Monday denied Johnson's request to lower the bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But one of his attorneys and a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office say that was erroneous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Johnson was charged last week with trying to interfere with his brother's arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last August, Johnson was walking with the 18-year-old, unarmed Brown when Brown was fatally shot by a Ferguson police officer.</td></tr>
