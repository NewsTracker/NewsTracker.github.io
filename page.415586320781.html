<tr><td>3</td><td>The group, which has hundreds of Tunisians among its ranks, threatened more attacks, saying: "What you have seen is only the start."</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>"We will never move backwards."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The leader of the Islamist opposition party Ennahda, Rached Ghannouchi, said he was convinced that "the Tunisian people will stay united in the face of barbarity".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The media also called for solidarity, with newspaper La Presse appealing for "total unity and a sense of responsibility shared by all".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Panic had broken out as gunmen in military uniforms opened fire at visitors as they got off a bus and then chased them inside the museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The dead included three Japanese, two Spaniards, a Colombian, an Australian, a British woman, a Belgian woman, two French, a Pole and an Italian, Health Minister Said Aidi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Dozens more people were wounded in the assault, in a massive blow to Tunisia's heavily tourism-dependent economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At least two major cruise ship operators suspended stopovers in Tunis following the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>After cowering in fear in the museum during the night, two Spanish tourists were discovered alive and well, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The government, in a show of defiance, said the National Bardo Museum would reopen early next week.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>Prime Minister Habib Essid named the two gunmen killed by security forces at the museum as Yassine Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui.</td></tr>

<h3>Courtney Barnett to Release First Full-Length Album</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the song "Aqua Profunda!" singer Courtney Barnett describes trying so hard to impress a crush swimming in the lane next to her at the neighborhood pool that she nearly drowns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It's a pretty straightforward love song," Ms. Barnett says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The tune features the conversational lyrics that have already become a trademark for the Australian musician, whose first full-length album, "Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit," is set for release March 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I took a tumble turn for the worse, it's a curse/ My lack of athleticism," she sings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Sunk like a stone/ Like a first owner's home loan."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The material on her new album, which has garnered critical praise and landed her a high-profile TV appearance, is full of digressive wordplay that Ms. Barnett, 27, intones deadpan over a spare, indie-rock sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Her songs on two previous EPs-and the off-handed way she sings them-have prompted reviewers to label Ms. Barnett's music "slacker pop."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Ms. Barnett says she's diligent about working on the words, honing turns of phrase, layering songs with double meanings and playing with alliteration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"When you don't cringe at any lyrics in a song, then you know that it's done," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ms. Barnett was a breakout performer at 2013's CMJ Music Marathon in New York City, a festival for upstart acts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It was clear she was still trying to get used to being on stage, but the songs were very good and she was very charming as a live performer," says Matt McDonald, the showcase director for the festival, who booked Ms. Barnett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The album's reception includes a rave review in the Guardian that called it "a richly rewarding experience, one that increases with each listen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ms. Barnett and her band-a drummer and bass player support her vocals and electric guitar-appeared on "Ellen" March 16 and performed half a dozen times at this week's South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She returns to the U.S. in May for a tour that mixes headline dates with appearances at festivals, including Bonnaroo, in Manchester, Tenn., in June and the Newport Folk Festival, in Rhode Island, in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>By the time she performed at CMJ in 2013, Ms. Barnett had been playing guitar in bands around Melbourne, where she also worked in a bar after dropping out of art school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The job afforded her plenty of opportunity to watch people interact, and she scribbled down notes she later molded into lyrics that have drawn praise for their humor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I wouldn't really consider myself very funny or witty," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"At parties or something, I'm not the one telling big stories and making everybody laugh."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ms. Barnett grew up in a Sydney suburb and started playing guitar when she was 10, inspired by her older brother, who also played, and the handful of CDs they had by Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Her influences reach further on "Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit," which she says bears traces of "the stabby guitars of Television, and a bit of Wilco and Lou Reed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Though the album is her third original release (her two earlier EPs were released in the U.S. last year as a compilation called "The Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas"), Ms. Barnett says the process of making music hasn't gotten easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I just stress a lot by nature. If you're not stressing, then it means you're not caring," she says, then pauses to consider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Maybe. Maybe that's a bit extreme."</td></tr>
