<h3>Future unsure for troubled New Mexico green chile production</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this Saturday, July 25, 215 photo, workers harvest chile on the 350-acre Adams Produce farm near Hatch, New Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Efforts are underway to save the green chile that's important to traditional New Mexican fare as labor shortages, a previous severe drought and competition from China, India and Mexico endanger its growth in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - Green chiles have defined New Mexico for generations, gaining fans and fame around the globe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, as this year's harvest begins, labor shortages, shrinking acreage, drought and foreign competition have hurt production in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Farmers and producers say the problems reveal the need for changes in the industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To rejuvenate production, investors and inventors are testing machines that would harvest and de-stem the crop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The delicate chiles are now picked by hand, and problems with bruising and the removal of stems have made it difficult to make the transition to machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The labor force is getting older and not a lot of young people are getting into the business," said Ed Ogaz, owner of the Anthony, New Mexico-based chile wholesaler Seco Spice Co. "Something needs to happen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ogaz prefers the old ways and believes farmers need more laborers to improve production as acreage dedicated to chile production has fallen to a 43-year low in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Chile has been a staple of New Mexico cuisine for centuries, and the Hatch region has become world famous for its flavorful hot peppers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chile is also the state vegetable and the basis of the official state question, "red or green?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In recent years, researchers at New Mexico State University have been trying to solve the labor issue by developing machines for the harvest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Elad Etgar, inventor of a chile-harvesting device at an Israeli company, said he will be testing his machine for the next two months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After the harvest, he'll sit down with farmers to assess its performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"So far, everyone supports it but we will have to see," Etgar told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Another device by a New Hampshire investor also is being tested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ogaz said he is withholding judgment until he sees how the devices harvest green chiles without damaging the signature look.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The stakes are high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In 2014, New Mexico saw a 10 percent decline in acres of chiles harvested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Experts say the state is losing chile acreage to West Texas and Mexico, partly because of the cost and availability of labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Despite marketing efforts and the attractiveness of New Mexico chiles to national suppliers, federal numbers show the value of New Mexico red and green chiles was estimated at $38.7 million, compared to $49.5 million in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>State officials say the number reflects only the value of agricultural items in the raw commodity state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They point to New Mexico Chile Association numbers that say the full economic impact of chiles, both fresh and processed, was more than $460 million a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Fresh green chile is what satisfies our cravings in August and September, so that's the foundation of New Mexico's chile economy," New Mexico Secretary of Agriculture Jeff Witte said.</td></tr>
