<tr><td>2</td><td>Formula One drivers Fernando Alonso and Valtteri Bottas were given the all-clear on Thursday to race in the Malaysian Grand Prix this weekend after missing the season's start because of injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>F1 medics cleared two-time world champion Alonso to make his McLaren debut after he suffered a concussion in a still-unexplained crash in testing on February 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Alonso, who suffered temporary memory loss in the crash, was sidelined for the season-opener in Australia to avoid the risk of a second head impact too soon after the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Spaniard "passed all mandatory fitness tests and has thus been declared fit to race in this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix", governing body FIA said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Williams driver Bottas was also passed fit at the Sepang circuit after missing the season's first race on March 15 with a lower back injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Alonso's MP4-30 car will carry an extra sensor in Malaysia after he recalled "heavy steering" before his crash on an innocuous stretch of Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Several observers commented that the crash seemed unusual, with Alonso's manager Flavio Briatore labelling it "very strange".</td></tr>
