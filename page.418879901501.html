<h3>Telstra TV to take on Google, Apple</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Telstra is reportedly preparing to launch a device that streams video services such as Netflix and Stan to TV sets in competition with Google and Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Telstra is set to take on Apple and Google with a device that streams internet video services such as Netflix and Stan to home televisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The telco will launch Telstra TV in September, Fairfax Media says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The service will work much the same way as Google's Chromecast, with a device that plugs into TV sets and hosts apps that play catch-up and on-demand services as well as streaming content provided by Netflix, Stan, Presto and YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The move into the technology is designed to win Telstra new internet subscribers without paying the hundreds of millions of dollars it would need to become a media producer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company's group managing director for media and marketing, Joe Pollard, has told the Sydney Morning Herald the telco's target is the entire remainder of the market that doesn't currently hold a pay TV subscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Because the streaming technology would be more affordable, however, Telstra TV is also being seen as a potential nail in the coffin for Foxtel.</td></tr>
