<h3>American who contracted Ebola improves, in serious condition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BETHESDA, Md.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - Doctors say an American health care worker who contracted Ebola while volunteering in a Sierra Leone treatment unit has improved to serious condition at the National Institutes of Health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The agency announced Thursday that the patient's status improved from critical condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He is being treated at the NIH's hospital near Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The patient was flown in isolation from Sierra Leone on a chartered plane and arrived March 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The NIH said initially that the patient was in serious condition, but announced last week that his status had been downgraded to critical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The patient's name and age have not been released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He is a clinician working with Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit organization, which has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our colleague is doing much better," Partners in Health co-founder Paul Farmer said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In fact, he has, in the opinion of some of the best doctors and nurses in the world, turned the corner. He is likely a long way from discharge, but is improving on all fronts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The organization said ten other clinicians who had been in contact with the infected health care worker are also being monitored but don't appear to be showing symptoms.</td></tr>
