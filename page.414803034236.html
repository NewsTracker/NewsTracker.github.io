<h3>Clashes threaten Ukraine ceasefire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Ukrainian military command said the pro-Russian rebels had attacked 112 times since early Sunday, mostly in the bitterly contested Debaltseve area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A Ukrainian officer said there was also fighting near Mariupol, a port city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The rebels accused Ukrainian forces of shelling Donetsk airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Meanwhile, further EU sanctions against Russia have gone into effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new sanctions list targets 19 officials - most of them in the pro-Russian separatist strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk, but also two Russian deputy defence ministers and a Russian celebrity singer and MP, Iosif Kobzon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Russian foreign ministry said the latest sanctions, which include asset freezes and travel bans across the EU, "look especially ridiculous against the background of the Minsk [ceasefire] accords."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But an EU official said the sanctions were intended to punish the Russian-backed rebels for a rocket attack on Mariupol last month which killed more than 30 civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The sanctions were meant to come into force last week, but they were postponed because the EU didn't want to interfere with the Minsk talks. But they always intended to implement these sanctions, and today, they have," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Observers from the OSCE security body are to try again to reach the besieged Ukrainian town of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They said they were denied access by the rebels on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande have called for the OSCE to be granted free access to eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Along with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, they also expressed their concern over the ongoing fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In the past 24 hours, five Ukrainian soldiers died in fighting at Shirokyne, near Mariupol, the Ukrainian military said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The rebels say they have Debaltseve encircled so it should be considered theirs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Monday, rebel commanders said there were no grounds yet to withdraw heavy weapons from the combat zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Rebel "defence minister" Vladimir Kononov said: "We will withdraw heavy weapons from the contact line if we get a definite sign that the Ukrainian side has started doing the same thing".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On the Ukrainian side, a military spokesman quoted by Reuters news agency said there would be no withdrawal of heavy weapons yet because the rebels were violating the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Elsewhere on the front line reports say the ceasefire has broadly been observed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But according to the Minsk agreement, reached last week, the ceasefire is only the first step.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It should be followed on Monday by a withdrawal of heavy weapons - lasting two weeks - to create buffer zones 50-140km (30-85 miles) wide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Analysts point out that previous ceasefires initially appeared to be holding but eventually failed, and say the next 48 hours are critical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Officials say more than 5,400 people have been killed since the conflict erupted in eastern Ukraine in April, but the UN believes the actual death toll to be much higher.</td></tr>

<h3>Fierce artillery battle persists for rail hub in east Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Intense artillery exchanges between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists persisted Monday around a strategic town in eastern Ukraine - fighting that threatens to dash a ceasefire deal brokered by European leaders last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Under the ceasefire agreement negotiated by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, the warring sides are to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That plan already looks at risk, with the rebels saying they are not satisfied that conditions are in place for the process to go ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Associated Press reporters in Luhansk, a government-held town 15 kilometres northwest of the bitterly contested railway hub of Debaltseve, heard sustained shelling Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some of the artillery appeared to be outgoing, suggesting it was being fired by Ukrainian troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Debaltseve, still in government hands, remains in contention despite the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The rebels insist the town should revert to their control because they have encircled it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A loaded Grad rocket launcher was seen pointing in the direction of Debaltseve, but it was not fired while AP journalists were present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Speaking by telephone Monday night, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko expressed concerns about the continued fighting at Debaltseve and "also expressed the wish that the OSCE observers have a free access to continue their work on the ground," an official in Hollande's entourage said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The official spoke anonymously because they were not allowed to speak publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Observers from the Organization from Security and Co-operation in Europe, who are supposed to monitor the cease-fire, said Sunday that separatists denied them access to Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Despite the ceasefire that went into effect early Sunday morning, five Ukrainian troops were killed and 25 were wounded in the past 24 hours, Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Separatist military official Eduard Basurin said in a televised news conference Monday that the government overnight lobbed artillery at Horlivka, a town under rebel control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ukraine, however, blamed that attack on the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The government-appointed police chief of the Donetsk region, Vyacheslav Abroskin, said the separatists shelled the town in order to derail the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The cease-fire appeared to hold elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The city hall of the rebel capital Donetsk, which came under heavy artillery fire in the past week, said on Monday that there was no fighting in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of arming and supplying manpower to the separatists and have imposed a range of economic sanctions to pressure Moscow into changing its course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Russia denies all suggestions it is directly involved in the war in Ukraine, but the sheer amount of heavy weapons the rebels have belies that claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The cease-fire had raised cautious hopes for an end to the 10-month-old conflict, which has already claimed more than 5,300 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Ukraine and rebel officials have already traded multiple accusations of attacks since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Both the separatists and the Ukrainian government insist they are committed to the cease-fire negotiated in marathon talks last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But the Russian news agency Interfax quoted Basurin as saying Monday that conditions are not yet ready to pull back heavy weapons on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We will begin pulling back equipment from the line of contact if we receive a certain signal, which is if the Ukrainians also do the same thing," Basurin was quoted as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In Berlin, Merkel appealed for the cease-fire to be respected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The situation is fragile," she conceded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"[But] that was certainly to be expected with a view to Debaltseve."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli mentioned the possibility of a meeting between the German, French, Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers this week to discuss "further steps" to implement the cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>President Vladimir Putin's aide Yuri Ushakov told Russian news agencies that the cease-fire is "changing the situation dramatically" and that Moscow looks forward to the heavy weaponry being pulled out from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>On Monday, the European Union added 19 more people and nine organizations to its list of sanctioned Russian entities, including two Russian deputy defence ministers, the eastern Ukraine-born Russian crooner Iosif Kobzon, who sang to the rebel leaders in Donetsk last year, and several separatist commanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted angrily to the decision, calling it "clumsy" in the context of last week's cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The ministry dismissed the new EU sanctions as "running against common sense" and harming chances "to resolve an internal Ukrainian conflict."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow, Geir Moulson in Berlin, Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Balint Szlanko in Artemivsk, Ukraine, and Peter Leonard in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.</td></tr>
