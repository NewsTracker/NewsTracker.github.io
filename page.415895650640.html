<h3>Bali nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran pin hopes on last-ditch legal bid to avoid firing squad</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They are now on Nusakambangan penal island awaiting their fate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A panel of judges will on Monday rule on whether the State Administrative Court of Jakarta can hear an appeal against the rejection of the Bali nine duo's clemency pleas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This is the last-ditch legal avenue for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who face imminent execution by firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lawyers for Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday argued the court had no jurisdiction over presidential decrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This is disputed by the Bali nine duo's lawyers, who earlier this week produced an expert legal witness who said there was no public policy that could not be challenged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran asked the president for mercy over their role in a foiled attempt to export 8.3 kilograms of heroin to Australia 10 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, Mr Joko rejected their clemency pleas and the two men are among 10 drug felons who have been told they will be killed in the second round of executions in Indonesia this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lawyers for the Australians have launched legal action in the Administrative Court, arguing the President did not consider their clemency pleas on an individual basis or take into account their rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Instead, Mr Joko vowed to refuse all clemency pleas for drug felons because Indonesia was in a state of emergency due to drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, on February 24 the court ruled it did not have the authority to rule on a presidential decree - a decision that was then appealed by the Bali nine's lawyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>State attorney Novarida said clemency was the president's prerogative right and the administrative court should uphold its February 24 ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Meanwhile, the head of corrections service in central Java, Ahmad Yuspahruddin, said Chan and Sukumaran would remain in semi-isolation cells at Besi prison on Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However he said they could attend church, where they could see other prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We are still limiting their access to other prisoners," said Mr Ahmad, who visited the prison on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"There's transparent wires blocking them from the rest of the prisoners. They can hear each other. They just can't meet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Ahmad said they would remain in the observation cells until there was a clear indication of when the executions would take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"If we allow them out of the observation and then soon after the execution takes place; we can't have that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Ahmad said if the men needed counselling, a pastor could visit them in their cells.</td></tr>
