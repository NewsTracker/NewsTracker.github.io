<h3>Clinton to hand over email server</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton has agreed to hand over to the FBI the private email server that she used as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Her use of private email has generated a barrage of criticism as Mrs Clinton runs for president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Critics say that her set-up was unsecure, contrary to government policy and designed to shield her communications from oversight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The FBI is investigating whether classified information was improperly sent via the server and stored there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mrs Clinton initially handed over thousands of pages of emails to the state department, but not the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Her lawyers will also hand over to the FBI memory sticks which contain the copies of the emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Her use of private email has been a major issue in the presidential race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Polls show an increasing number of voters view her as "untrustworthy" due in part to the questions surrounding her email use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Under US federal law, officials' correspondence is considered to be US government property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Government employees are encouraged to use government email accounts although some top officials have used personal accounts in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In March, Mrs Clinton said she and her lawyers made the decision over what would be considered work-related email when the state department asked for records from former secretaries of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The emails deemed work-related were about half of the 60,000 emails she sent in total during her time in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The emails she deemed personal were deleted, Mrs Clinton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since then, the state department has been releasing the emails to the public in batches about once a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However on Tuesday, the state department said it would not be releasing a portion of the emails because some of the messages were retroactively determined to be "top secret".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Senior Republican Reince Priebus said Mrs Clinton had "run out of options" in the face of FBI scrutiny.</td></tr>
