<h3>Greece told now or never: Agreement must be reached or country will crash out of euro</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GREECE has been told that it is drinking in the last chance saloon as EU leaders issued their bluntest warning yet that the country is set to crash out of the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The beleaguered country will get one last chance to convince its creditors to loosen their purse strings or face the prospect of a default and financial oblivion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greek premier Alexis Tsipras and his rookie finance minister now have until Sunday to rush emergency legislation through parliament and come up with a credible package of financial reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If they do not, they have been warned that their country will be left to tumble out of the euro and go bankrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A sombre looking president of the European Union tonight called the crisis "the most critical moment in our history".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Grim-faced Donald Tusk told reporters: "I have to say it loud and clear the final deadline ends this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We cannot exclude a black scenario if there is no agreement by Sunday. We need to discuss the whole consequences for the European Union."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His comments came after minister from 19 eurozone states failed yet again to agree a credit deal with Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Instead they postponed negotiations until a make-or-break conference of all 28 European Union leaders on Sunday, when they will have one last throw at the dice to keep Greece in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Leaders at the summit were reportedly angered by the fact that Mr Tsipras and his new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis apparently arrived at the meeting without any new proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The warning came after a Greek official admitted that the country's banks - which had been due to reopen today - may now stay shut until at least next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>George Katrougalos, a minister for administrative reform, said that a decision must be made to reopen the banks, but "that's probably is not technically possible this week."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earlier today European President Jean-Claude Juncker appeared to show contempt for the democratic voice of the Greek people when he described Sunday's referendum on austerity as a "circus".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The outspoken eurocrat reacted furiously to the vote, saying: "I think it is unacceptable for the European Commission to be deemed terrorists by the Greek government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On whether Greece's position in the eurozone can be salvaged, he gloomily added: "Quite clearly the ball lies in the court of the Greek government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, told reporters he was "extremely sombre" about the result of today's summit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He added: "I'm also sombre about the question of whether Greece really wants to come up with proposals, with a solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"And it is really up to the Greek government to come up with far-reaching proposals. If they don't do that, then I think it will be over quickly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Their comments came after Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, told a German radio station before the referendum that Greece would have to leave the euro if people voted 'no'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the interview, taped last Thursday and broadcast on Sunday, he said: "Is Greece still in the euro after this referendum? That is certainly the case, but if they say 'no' they will have to introduce another currency after the referendum because the euro is not available as a means of payment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Answering reporters' questions today he angrily denied that he wanted Greece out of the euro, stating: "I am in favour of Greece remaining in the euro zone. Those people who want to split up the euro zone I think are wrong. My personal opinion is that Grexit cannot be our aim."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>However, other European leaders were more optimistic of a deal being secured, with Italian premier Matteo Renzi saying he believes an agreement will be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He said: "I hope this could be the last meeting about Greece, I hope this could be the end of the war, and there would be a happy end. I think we have not only the emergency in Greece, we have a very incredible problem of Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>German leader Angela Merkel was also more optimistic than in previous days after the European Central Bank agreed to keep financing Greece so long as negotiations are ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>She said: "We all share responsibility for the euro."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Speaking after the summit French President Francois Hollande added: "It is impossible to lose time. I'm aware of what the Greek people are going through, failing the necessary liquidity but it is a matter for the whole EU.</td></tr>
