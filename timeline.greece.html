<li>Ratings agencies say no default if Greece misses ECB, IMF payments</li>
<li>Greece owes nearly 1-billion to the IMF in May and almost 7-billion to the ECB over July and August and there are concerns that the government, stuck in funding talks with official lenders, will miss the payments.</li>
<li>Standard and Poor's, Fitch and DBRS, three of the top four, all say that as the IMF and ECB are not standard creditors, a missed payment to either, although likely to push Greece's rating even deeper into junk, would not be classed as a default.</li>
<li>"If Greece were, for whatever reason, not to make a payment to the IMF or ECB that would not constitute a default under our criteria as it is 'official' sector debt," said Frank Gill, who rates Greece for S&P.</li>
<li>As was seen during Greece's massive 2012 debt restructuring, only when all four of the main agencies - Moody's is the other one - declared Athens in default, did the ECB say it would not accept Greek bonds as ELA collateral.</li>
