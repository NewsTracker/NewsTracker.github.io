<h3>Prosecutors get Tamir Rice investigation</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(CNN)The Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office in Ohio handed its investigation into the shooting death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice to prosecutors on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The Sheriff's Office received the file on February 13th, and has performed an extensive, thorough and unbiased investigation. It is now up to the Prosecutor to determine how next to proceed," the office said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tamir was holding a fake gun when a Cleveland police officer shot him November 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The boy died a day later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He had been playing in a park near his home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A witness called 911, reporting that there was "a guy with a pistol," adding that the weapon was "probably" fake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That information -- that the gun the caller saw was probably not real and that the person holding it appeared to be a juvenile -- was not conveyed to the officers who responded, according to recordings that law enforcement released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann fired the fatal shots at Tamir within two seconds of arriving outside the recreation center, where the sixth-grader was playing with the pellet gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The killing evoked international headlines and stoked outrage across the United States as the nation reeled from police-involved shootings of unarmed African-American men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tamir Rice was black.</td></tr>
