<h3>Hurricane Blanca weakens slightly to Category 3 storm</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MIAMI (AP) - Hurricane Blanca has weakened slightly to a Category 3 storm as it swirls in the eastern Pacific off Mexico's coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The hurricane's maximum sustained winds decreased to near 125 mph (205 kph) early Thursday but the U.S. National Hurricane Center says some re-strengthening is expected during the next day or so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blanca is centered about 490 miles (790 kilometers) south of Manzanillo, Mexico, and has been drifting southwest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But it's expected to begin moving northwestward later in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Swells from the hurricane will begin affecting Mexico's southwestern coast and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Meanwhile, farther out over the Pacific, Tropical Storm Andres is quickly losing strength and is expected to become a remnant low by Thursday night or early Friday.</td></tr>
