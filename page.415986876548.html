<h3>Focus in Ferguson shifts to election of City Council members</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It is the first election since the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man, Michael Brown, by a white Ferguson police officer last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The fallout revealed a community deeply divided along racial lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are black, but the mayor and five of the six council members are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That makeup will change since the 3rd Ward has two black candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 1st Ward has two black and two white candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Both candidates in the 2nd Ward are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ferguson staggers elections for three-year terms, so three council members and the mayor are not facing election this year.</td></tr>
