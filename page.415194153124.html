<h3>Over 30 killed in mine blast in east Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thirty-three miners have been confirmed dead after a coal mine blast in the rebel-held city of Donetsk near the battle front in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mine officials said the explosion was most likely caused by gas and not linked to fighting at the nearby frontline in the war between Moscow-backed rebels and Ukraine government forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nevertheless, Kiev suggested the war had made the disaster worse, accusing the separatists of holding up a rescue effort by restricting access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Outside the gates of the Zasyadko mine, about 30 relatives clamoured for information about any survivors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The sister of one miner who was in the pit at the time of the explosion, Alexei Novoselsky, stood in tears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Tell me, are there survivors? Why are you concealing the truth," she said as a local rescue services employee tried to calm her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Eduard Dmitrenko, a miner who went down the affected shaft after the blast, said it was unlikely anyone would have been found alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Donetsk has been the scene of heavy fighting between Moscow-backed separatist rebels, who control the area, and forces loyal to the government in Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The neighbourhood around the mine had come under artillery fire, with fragments from Grad rockets visible on surrounding roads.</td></tr>
