<h3>Americans evacuated after possible Ebola contact</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The World Health Organisation says its tally of Ebola deaths has passed 10,000, mostly in West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>New York: Several American aid workers, among at least 10 who might have come into contact with the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone, have been evacuated over the weekend, the most Americans who have returned home over fears of exposure to the virus since an outbreak in three West African countries was declared last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Another aid worker, who was showing signs of illness, arrived in the US on Friday evening, hours after a colleague with Ebola was flown from Sierra Leone to the clinical centre of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That patient, a clinician who was not identified, tested positive for the virus on Tuesday, and investigators feared that he had exposed others to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The workers served at an Ebola treatment unit run by the US charity Partners in Health in the Port Loko district in northern Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The American who arrived Friday evening had developed symptoms last week, but tested negative twice, said several officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She is being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has a specialised unit for Ebola patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The patient's entrance at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, now housing a US healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola while working in Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Because the 10 other aid workers are not showing symptoms, they will not be hospitalised, but will instead remain in isolation and be subject to monitoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Saturday that the Americans would be taken on three flights to be close to three hospitals capable of treating Ebola patients: the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the National Institutes of Health centre in Bethesda or Emory University Hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So far, none of the other 10 aid workers have developed symptoms, said the embassy spokeswoman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An investigation is continuing, and more workers will be evacuated if necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, described the infected clinician's condition as serious on Friday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Saturday, a spokeswoman for the National Institutes of Health said there had been no change to report.</td></tr>

<h3>'Fed up' circus elephant lynched for 'murder' in 1916</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But as kooky as it sounds, it's a true story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It happened nearly a century ago, in 1916.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The chain of events began as Big Mary and four other elephants from the Sparks Circus lumbered toward a water hole between their matinee and evening performances that Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>12 in Kingsport, Tenn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to the prevailing narrative, Big Mary strayed toward a succulent watermelon rind discarded along her path.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Perched atop Mary's broad shoulders, handler Red Eldridge used his bullhook to persuade her back toward his preferred route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>When the elephant again pivoted toward the watermelon, Eldridge whacked her hard, digging into her flesh with the barb of the bullhook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With that, Big Mary reached back with her trunk, plucked the scrawny Eldridge from her back and body-slammed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She then squashed his head like a grape under her platter-sized foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ed Stewart, president of Performing Animals Welfare Society, a Galt, Calif., sanctuary for elephants and other former circus beasts, said he thought of Big Mary when Ringling Bros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>announced last week that it would stop using elephants by 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"She's an example of why we should never have put these animals in such unnatural situations in the first place," Stewart told The Justice Story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This elephant was simply acting like an elephant. They are inherently dangerous, and I don't blame her for what happened. I blame those who put her in the circus. It's their fault."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A century ago, Tennesseans didn't see it that way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Townspeople who witnessed Mary's deadly fury were stirred to chant, "Kill the elephant!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Someone in the crowd plinked five or six shots from a .32 revolver into her thick hide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She barely noticed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The death of Eldridge quickly became a crisis for Charlie Sparks' circus, a middling operation that had survived 25 years on thin margins by making one-day stands at railroad whistle-stops like Kingsport that Barnum & Bailey wouldn't bother with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Local authorities wanted to hold the show in town for an inquiry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But Sparks had to be in Erwin, Tenn., the next day - then on to Johnson City, Rogersville, and so on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Sparks surely didn't want to leave Big Mary behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She was his star, with marquee billing for more than 20 years as "the largest living land animal on Earth," a skosh taller than P.T. Barnum's famous Jumbo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If Big Mary had the longest tenure with the Sparks Circus, the handler she killed had the shortest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Red Eldridge was a drifter who had signed on just 36 hours before he died, when the show stopped in St. Paul, Va., where he was pushing a broom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He had no circus experience, but the callow newcomer was handed a bullhook and assigned to marshal a 10,000-pound pachyderm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Big Mary's destiny was sealed when a loopy Kingsport magistrate issued an ad hoc decree ordering her execution - to "hang by the neck until you are dead," the Tennessee protocol for a human being convicted of murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Charlie Sparks gave shrugging concession, which allowed his show to go on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>An improvised gallows was waiting the next morning when the circus pulled into Erwin, Tenn., 40 miles down the rails from Kingsport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Virtually the entire population of the town of 2,500 assembled for the spectacle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Big Mary was positioned beneath a 100-ton crane made to lift railroad cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A necklace of stout chain was cinched around her head and linked to the crane, which slowly lifted the poor beast off her feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>She dangled briefly, then fell with a bone-cracking thud when the chain broke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"It made a right smart little racket when the elephant hit the ground," according to an eyewitness quoted years later in a local magazine story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Big Mary writhed for more than an hour while someone fetched a thicker noose chain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Mercifully, the job was completed on the second go-round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The Sparks show rolled on again the next day, leaving Big Mary buried in the Erwin railyard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>For decades, the bizarre lynching escaped notice, and the identities of those involved - beyond Sparks, Eldridge and Big Mary - were scrubbed as the tale was passed down in local history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But the story has been resurrected in several recent books, and it has emerged as a bullet point among infamous elephant atrocities since the Ringling Bros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"Mary sounds to me like an elephant that was fed up," said Stewart, the circus animal advocate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>For more than 30 years, his sanctuary group has urged a ban on traveling elephants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He said he now expects other circuses to follow the Ringling Bros.' lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>About 100 elephants now perform in American circuses, half for Ringling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>A ban on elephants and other wild animals in traveling circuses takes effect this year in England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>And many U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, have banned the use of bullhooks, the device that apparently touched off Big Mary's fury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"There have been circus-elephant protests at the grass-roots level all over the country," Stewart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"The handwriting is now on the wall. This must end."</td></tr>
