<h3>Apple investors question whether iPhone sales growth has peaked</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Sept 19, 2014 file photo, a customer shows off the new Apple iPhone 6, right, and 6 Plus at a store in Tokyo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple sold 61 million iPhones in the first three months of 2015, or 40 percent more than in the same period a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Welcome to the great iPhone debate of 2015: Have sales of the larger-screened phones peaked?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A day after Apple posted a 33 percent jump in quarterly earnings, shares rose and fell on Tuesday as investors questioned whether Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook can keep iPhone sales roaring and continue to turn in revenue growth in excess of 20 percent a quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On one side is billionaire investor Carl Icahn and some analysts who argue that Apple stock is poised to go higher, driven by a longer sales cycle for the bigger iPhones as well as a just-released smartwatch and other products on the horizon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Others say growth may decelerate later this year as demand for the phones trails off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Things are going exceptionally well, but investors are always two steps ahead of where their current business is," Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"If investors would take these results and feel like there was some potential acceleration in the future, then they would feel great about owning it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple shares slipped 1.6 percent to $130.56 at the close of regular trading Tuesday, after rising as much as 1.4 percent and falling as much as 2.3 percent earlier in the session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Optimism about Apple's future has helped drive the company's shares to record levels this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As a follow-up to all-time-high profit and iPhone sales in the quarter that ended in December, Apple posted earnings for the March period that ranked as its second-highest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple in those two quarters sold a combined 135.6 million iPhones, compared with 169.2 million for all of fiscal 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Potential upside from iPhone seems to be waning and we see more risk to consensus F2016 estimates than upside opportunity," Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, wrote in a note to investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Analysts' consensus estimates for next year anticipate "iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch unit sales that are at the high end of or above what we believe is likely, which suggests our expectations are meaningfully low or new categories are needed to make up the difference."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Indeed, Apple will face tough year-over-year comparisons in the next fiscal year, when there won't be the same pent-up demand for Apple's first large-screen iPhones, according to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"This highlights the risk that iPhone sales growth will resume its decline, particularly as comparisons grow more difficult" starting in the final three months of this year, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst John Butler wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Apple, for its part, says the momentum will continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which debuted in September, helped boost Apple's phone unit sales for the recent quarter by 40 percent globally and more than 70 percent in China, where the new larger screens are especially popular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Apple estimates that only 20 percent of its active installed base of iPhone users has upgraded to the new device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"That suggests there's plenty of upgrade headroom," Cook told analysts Monday on a conference call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We want to keep inviting over as many switchers as we can."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Icahn has argued that Apple is undervalued and should be trading at $203 a share, which would give the company a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Its current value is about $765 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>His optimism for Apple is driven in part by his predictions for the iPhone and new products, including the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He took to Twitter on Tuesday with a message that he still thinks Apple is "undervalued and misunderstood," and said he'll release a report on the company within two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Meanwhile it was good news, bad news for two other Apple mainstays, the iPad and Mac computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>iPad sales down: Apple's tablet computing device, once a red-hot consumer gadget, has suffered from a steady decline in sales over the last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Apple sold 12.6 million iPads in the latest quarter, for about $5.4 billion in revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>That's down from 16.3 million iPads sold in the same period a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Analysts say consumers are realizing tablets aren't as useful for some tasks, and they're also waiting longer to buy new models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Cook said Monday that some potential iPad users are opting instead for the company's new lightweight MacBook computers, or even the newer iPhone models that have larger screens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But Cook said he sees a future for the iPad in business settings, where workers can use specialized iPad apps created by IBM and other commercial software developers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I believe the iPad is an extremely good business over the long term," Cook said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Precisely when it begins to grow again, I wouldn't want to predict. But I strongly believe that it will."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Mac sales up: At a time when market researchers say the personal computer market is shrinking, Apple is actually increasing its sales of Macs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The company sold 4.6 million Mac desktops and notebook computers in the last quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>That's a lot fewer than the estimated 13.4 million PCs sold by leading PC-maker Lenovo in the same period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But the Mac contributed $5.6 billion of Apple's revenue last quarter and saw unit sales grow 10 percent, while market researchers at International Data Corp. estimate total PC sales by all vendors shrank nearly 7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The growth in Mac sales was led by Apple's MacBook portables, said Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri, although he did not break out desktop or laptop figures.</td></tr>
