<h3>Tunisia says progress in museum massacre probe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"There are developments in the case, but to protect the secrecy of the investigation we prefer not to provide any details," prosecution spokesman Sofiene Sliti told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, Interior Minister Mohamed Ali Aroui said "more than 10 people have been arrested for direct or indirect involvement in the attack, among them people who provided logistical support".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He declined to say whether they included nine people already reported arrested, including the father, sister and two brothers of one of the gunmen police killed in the attack, Jabeur Khachnaoui.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The minister also said, without elaborating, that an arrest warrant had been issued for a Tunisian named Maher Ben Mouldi Kaidi for his suspected involvement in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A police source and acquaintance of Khachnaoui said the gunman's four relatives had now been freed, but Aroui would not confirm that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Wednesday, the two gunmen targeted tourists visiting the National Bardo Museum, killing 21 people, including a policeman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The dead tourists were four Italians, three Japanese, three French, two Spaniards, a Colombian, an Australian-Colombian, a British woman, a Belgian woman, three Poles and a Russian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The interior ministry on Saturday released on its Facebook page closed circuit television footage of the attackers inside the museum while alive and also still photographs of their dead bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The footage released did not show them shooting at anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dr Chadli Dziri, chief of surgery at the Charles Nicolle hospital in Tunis, said that of 43 people wounded in the attack there were still concerns about the prognosis for one, a Frenchwoman shot in the stomach and the leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dziri said it was clear that many people had been shot as they tried to escape, because they had been hit in the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Thursday, the Islamic State group claimed it was behind the attack and threatened more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Authorities said the gunmen had trained in neighbouring Libya, where the IS is believed to have training camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tunisia has seen an upsurge in Islamist extremism since the 2011 revolution that ousted dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and sparked the Arab Spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The brother of the other gunman, Yassine Laabidi, expressed shock that he was dead, "that he was involved in this; none of us in the family can understand what happened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He described Yassine as a "bon vivant" who "enjoyed a drink with mates and would joke around with everyone. He had no complex whatsoever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>One thing he said was that Yassine, who had become more of a devout Muslim in recent years, "was brainwashed by swines who send young men to their death in the name of religion".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tunisia has taken pride in forming a democratic government and achieving stability since the Arab Spring -- in marked contrast to countries such as Egypt and Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But dozens of police and military personnel have been killed in attacks blamed on Islamist militants.</td></tr>

<h3>Madden: Toronto Blue Jays turn to kids for help</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- Both Alex Anthopoulos, the Toronto Blue Jays GM, and his manager, John Gibbons, have no illusions about their job status this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After seeing how their boss and benefactor, longtime Jays president Paul Beeston, is being eased out by ownership (following a clumsy process last winter in which Orioles GM Dan Duquette and White Sox VP Kenny Williams were secretly interviewed for the job without their clubs' permission), they know that anything short of ending Toronto's 22-year absence from the postseason - the longest of any team in baseball - will almost surely result in them joining him out the door of the Rogers Centre and into the unemployment market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nevertheless, when the Jays gathered here for spring training, spirits were high that this would finally be that breakthrough season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The rest of the American League East was very underwhelming, especially with the defending champion Orioles losing three key players - major league home run leader Nelson Cruz, veteran clubhouse leader Nick Markakis and lefty setup man Andrew Miller, to free agency - and Anthopoulos having had an especially productive winter, significantly bolstering his lineup with the bold signing of catcher (and Canada native) Russell Martin for five years and $82 million and the trade acquisition of All-Star third baseman Josh Donaldson from the Oakland A's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>True, there were bullpen questions, with Aaron Sanchez, their top starting pitching prospect, penciled in to share the closer duties with incumbent lefty Brett Cecil, who's been idled all spring with shoulder soreness, but Anthopoulos and Gibbons felt the Jays had the best lineup in the division, with Jose Reyes at the top, Donaldson filling out the middle with Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion, and Martin adding further depth down lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And then Medford, N.Y.'s Marcus Stroman, who burst through as their best starter last year, tore his ACL in a routine pitchers fielding drill and everything was thrown into chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"When I heard about Marcus, I was completely numb. I got into my car and just drove and drove and drove," said Anthopoulos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Finally, when I couldn't drive any further, I just stopped the car and said: 'Okay. Let's bring on the kids!' and I started to get excited again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ah, yes, the kids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Although it was thought the Blue Jays had pretty much tapped out what was once considered one of the deepest systems in baseball, talent-wise, with the trades for Donaldson (in which they sacrificed pitchers Kendall Graveman, Sean Nolin and shortstop Franklin Barreto), and R.A. Dickey (which netted the Mets Travis d'Arnaud and Noah Syndergaard), and the 2012 mega deal with Miami for Reyes and Mark Buehrle (which cost them shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria, outfielder Jake Marisnick and pitchers Justin Nicolino and Anthony DeSclafani), they apparently did hang on to a lot of their better ones, all of whom are now suddenly key players in their hopes of still making it to the postseason this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Specifically, the loss of Stroman prompted the decision to abandon the Sanchez co-closer idea and move the 22-year-old righty, who is still trying to refine his slider, into the rotation where fellow rookie, 21-year-old lefty Daniel Norris, had already been handed the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>5 spot behind Dickey, Buerhle and Drew Hutchinson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As for the bullpen, well, it just may be that 20-year-old righties Miguel Castro and Roberto Osuna - both of whom pitched in A-ball last year but have been eye-popping this spring - are unexpectedly and prematurely ready to fill that void.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Castro especially has Anthopoulos and Gibbons excited, consistently lighting up the gun in the high 90s - against the Yankees' "A" lineup last Tuesday, he retired all eight batters, hitting 99 at least twice - while also demonstrating uncommon poise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He's a real big arm," Martin says of the 6-5, 190-pound Castro, "but even more impressive about him is his demeanor on the mound. It doesn't seem like he's nervous at all. His stuff, velocity, his fastball and the way he locates and how his changeup works off of it are all really nice weapons."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Who knows?" said Gibbons, "Maybe he can be our Dellin Betances."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Even before the Stroman injury, the Jays were prepared to make their run this year with a bunch of rookies in important roles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Besides Norris and Sanchez, 22-year-old switch-hitter Dalton Pompey, another Canadian and a premium defender with speed, was the anointed center fielder and likely No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>9 hitter, while fellow rookie Kevin Pillar, a .323 hitter with 10 homers and 27 stolen bases in 100 games at Triple-A last year, figures to get a lot of playing time in left, as well as center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The only other question in the Rays' lineup is second base, where veteran Maicer Izturis, who missed nearly all of last season with a knee injury but is owed $3 million in this, the last year of a three-year contract, was said to be the favorite to regain the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Izturis has been unimpressive this spring, while at the same time yet another rookie, Devon Travis, whom Anthopoulos acquired from Detroit last winter for light-hitting center fielder Anthony Gose, has been making a strong case for jump ingfrom Double-A Erie (where he hit .298 with 10 homers and 16 steals in 2014) to the Blue Jays' second base job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The 5-9, 195-pound Travis is your classic overachiever, a high-energy guy the scouts love for his hustle and his passion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>There were questions about his defense at second, and the need to give him some seasoning at Triple-A, but as of Friday he was hitting .344 with four doubles and five RBI and, in the scouts' opinions, had been fine defensively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"He's definitely opened eyes," said Gibbons of Travis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It very well could be we'll have seven rookies on our Opening Day roster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Ordinarily, that would seem to be more the product of a rebuilding team than to one with postseason aspirations, but the bottom line is the Blue Jays have no choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Anthopoulos is unwilling to give up any more prospects - or at least the kind of prospects it would take (like Castro and Pompey) - to acquire the Phillies' Cole Hamels and, as much as Jonathan Papelbon would solidify the bullpen and could be had for less, the $13 million, plus the $13 million vesting option, left on his contract, make him prohibitive for them as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>So it is Sanchez, Norris, Castro, Pompey, Pillar & Co. on whom they will stake their season - "Our pitching's about as stretched as it can be now," said Anthopoulos, "to the point where I've got maybe one more bullet left in my gun - (Marco) Estrada (the back-end rotation righty he obtained from the Milwaukee Brewers for first baseman/DH Adam Lind over the winter) if we have any more injuries."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Hopefully we saved the right guys," said Gibbons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We have to do what we have to do now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Then, he added with some gallows humor: "There was no point in saving them for next regime."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>- After a whirlwind winter in which GM Rick Hahn filled all his needs in the bullpen (David Robertson and Zach Duke), at first base (Adam LaRoche), left field (Melky Cabrera) and on the bench (Emilio Bonifacio), it's looking like the White Sox have resolved their one remaining question area - second base - from within.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Micah Johnson, who stole 84 bases at Single-A and Double-A ball two years ago, but slumped to just 22 last year because of hamstring and knee issues, has been the sensation of camp this spring, hitting .458 as of Friday, and has all but wrapped up the second base job, hopefully giving them an exciting added dimension as a second speed guy at the bottom of the lineup, ahead of Adam Eaton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>- Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar, who suffered the most bizarre of all these annoying oblique injuries by, gulp, sneezing too hard, is sporting a T-shirt that says: "Ask me about my sneeze."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Meanwhile, the Atlanta Braves, in reference to the massive overhaul they underwent this winter, have broken out T-shirts bearing the inscription, "Hello my name is ..." with a space for each player to fill in his name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Closer Craig Kimbrel, who came up with the idea, filled in his name space with "Dirty Craig."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>- Come 2017, there is going to be another major re-shuffling of the Grapefruit League map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>With the Astros (leaving Kissimmee) and Nationals (leaving Viera) closing in on a deal for a joint facility in West Palm Beach, the Braves, whose lease in Disney World is up in 2017, will be losing two of their closest teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>As such, they too will be moving and are said to be looking at a site on Interstate 4, a few miles east of Tampa near the Hard Rock Casino (which would put them in closer proximity to the Yankees, Phillies, Blue Jays, Tigers and Pirates) and also Venice, off south I-75, (which would put them in close proximity to the Red Sox, Twins, Pirates, Orioles and Rays).</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"It's a process. Whether it's passing that day or the next time through, time is starting to run a bit shorter. When nothing gets done in the offseason every year, it gets one year closer to other alternatives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Rays owner Stu Sternberg on his continuing battle with St. Pete officials over a new stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Translation: The Rays, facing another year of even steeper declines in attendance and advertising revenue, are getting closer and closer to moving out of Tampa Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Both Alex Anthopoulos, the Toronto Blue Jays GM, and his manager, John Gibbons, have no illusions about their job status this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Steve Nash, a two-time NBA MVP and the most accomplished Canadian player of all time, formally announced his retirement Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Darren Sharper's legal woes appear to be closer to a resolution after his lead attorney announced a plea agreement.</td></tr>
