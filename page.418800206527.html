<tr><td>7</td><td>"The reasons for the delay are neither political, nor diplomatic ones," the official added.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>The confusion around the expected start to the talks on Friday underlined the challenges ahead if negotiations are to be wrapped up in time for a bailout worth up to 86 billion euros to be approved in parliament by Aug. 20, as Greece intends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Already, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is struggling to contain a rebellion in his left-wing Syriza party that made his government dependent on votes from pro-European opposition parties to get the tough bailout terms approved in parliament.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>"They are still my comrades and I urge them to get back to their senses even at the last moment," he told Skai television.</td></tr>
