<h3>Brazil's have-nots take in Carnival parades from afar</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - Neuza Maria Terreira loves Carnival so much that neither the pouring rain nor the stench of a sewage-filled canal can keep her from getting as close as possible to Rio de Janeiro's world-famous samba school parades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Terreira is among hundreds of spectators who cannot afford a ticket to the vast grounds of the Sambadrome where Rio's samba school parades are held, and instead watches the nightlong extravaganza from bleachers a few hundred meters (yards) from the parade route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hundreds of other mostly poor people take in the parade from a nearby overpass, where some lounge in beach chairs and barbecue on portable grills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Carnival is Brazil's biggest popular party, but the masses are being excluded," said Terreira, a 53-year-old public school teacher whose black slicker helped protect her from driving rains Sunday, the first of two main parade nights at the Sambadrome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Here, we have to endure the smell of that rotten canal there," she said, gesturing at a sewage-filled waterway that separated the bleachers from the preparation area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There, on the other side, giant floats are hauled into place and dancers and musicians change into their over-the-top costumes as the 12 samba schools competing for this year's title get ready to enter the runway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We don't actually see much," said Terreira, "but it's better than nothing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rio's Carnival has its origins in the streets, and samba schools bear the names of the hillside "favela" slums where they were born.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But while about 14,200 tickets are sold for around $4, prices for most seats start at over $75 and rise sharply from there, which is a small fortune in a country where the monthly minimum wage is $278.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The most exclusive of the Sambadrome's "camarotes," or private boxes seating 30 people, fetch more than $42,000 nightly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Many of the low-price tickets are ultimately snatched up by scalpers, who on Sunday were reselling them for $70 each, said Jorgelina Tunala, a 52-year-old housewife who braved the drizzle on the bleachers set up by the local government each year and offered free of charge to users on a first-come, first-served basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In past years, she was able to score a scalped ticket for the Sambadrome around $20, but this year wasn't so lucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Here it's fun because there's really the Carnival spirit," Tunala shouted over hoots and cheers for Mocidade Independente as the samba school prepared to enter the runway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Venders hawking cans of ice-cold beer out of Styrofoam coolers jostled through the boisterous crowd, while others grilled hot dogs or served up tapioca omelets at stands at the foot of the bleachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It really doesn't compare with the experience you get inside the Sambadrome," where the whole parade is visible, not just the schools warming up, said Tunala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"If I can ever afford to get a ticket to the Sambadrome again, you better believe I won't be here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Patrick Souza, a 30-year-old history teacher from a distant, hardscrabble Rio suburb, said Carnival was going the same way as Brazilian soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>High ticket prices at Brazil's new stadiums, built for last year's World Cup, have meant fewer fans at games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Like soccer, Carnival is becoming a party for the rich," said Souza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"And that's a real shame because it's the poor who have always made up the heart of Carnival."</td></tr>
