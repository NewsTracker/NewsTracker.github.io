<h3>Ferguson grateful for his second chance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Sydney Roosters centre is yet to find the tryline for his new club but he said he's in a better place than 12 months ago when he faced an uncertain future after being placed on a two-year good behaviour bond for indecent assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After his court appearance in February last year, Ferguson suffered a broken ankle during a solo training session as he attempted to get fit to find a club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Roosters took on the troubled star late last year with a job in the club's development program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was as part of a series of guidelines set down by the NRL that had to be met before a playing contract could be ratified - something that finally happened in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ferguson admits the experience has been difficult and is doing his best to stay on the straight and narrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was pretty tough, I lost something that I really enjoyed," Ferguson said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I've played footy since I was four years old and it was the only thing I've known. I went through all the steps the NRL gave me, all the processes I was given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I know I did the wrong thing. I owe the game a lot, it's given me a real good opportunity to get back ... play some footy and earn a good living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I can't take it for granted, once you lose something that is so important you then realise what you have. It won't happen again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ferguson's troubles with alcohol and a difficult upbringing have been well documented and the 25-year-old knows it's something he'll continue to battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"No-one is fully rehabilitated ever," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There's people out there who are going to Alcoholics Anonymous and never fully rehabilitated until the day they die.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's been two months since Ferguson last had a drink and although the Roosters have not ordered him to stay dry, he's determined to live his life in a more responsible manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I don't drink all the time," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"But I am 25-year-old man ... I now know when to say no ... I've had a few wake-up calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I've not had a drink for eight weeks but I am not going to say I am not allowed to drink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The club have not put any bans on me. I haven't put a ban on myself.</td></tr>
