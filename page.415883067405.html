<h3>Patriots owner: Aaron Hernandez told me he was innocent (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- New England Patriots team owner Robert Kraft testified Tuesday that his former star tight end Aaron Hernandez told him he was innocent when asked if he was involved in a 2013 killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kraft was called by the prosecution in Hernandez's murder trial over the June 17, 2013, slaying of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He at times seemed uncomfortable on the stand, even when he was asked where he worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He first said 1 Patriot Place, the address of Gillette Stadium, where the Patriots play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When asked what he did at work, he replied, ''Whatever they ask me to do.'' Then, asked if he ran a business, he replied: ''We're a packaging and paper business and private equity, and we have two sports teams.'' He first listed the New England Revolution soccer team, then the Patriots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kraft was asked about the events of June 19, two days after the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By then, Kraft said, there was a strong media presence at Gillette Stadium, including helicopters, which were covering the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kraft said he found Hernandez in a weight room working out and pulled him into an adjacent office for a private talk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I understood there was an incident that had transpired, and I wanted to know whether he was involved, and if he was, any player that comes into our system, I consider part of our extended family, and I wanted to get him help,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''What did he say?'' prosecutor William McCauley asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''He said he was not involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That he was innocent and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club,'' Kraft said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Prosecutors have said Hernandez was at a bar earlier in the evening, then drove to Boston with two friends, picked up Lloyd and killed him in an industrial park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kraft said his conversation with Hernandez lasted five to 10 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Later, he saw him one last time at the stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''He hugged and kissed me and thanked me for my concern,'' Kraft said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hernandez signed a $40 million contract with the Patriots in 2012, but as defense lawyer Michael Fee questioned him, Kraft said he couldn't remember whether it ran through the 2018 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Hernandez watched closely during Kraft's testimony, which lasted a little over 30 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Next to the stand was the Patriots' director of security, Mark Briggs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said he also had a conversation with Hernandez on June 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The judge struck the comment from the record and instructed the jury that citizens do not have any obligation to speak with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Briggs said Hernandez told him that he had been with Lloyd at a club and they went their separate ways, so Hernandez gave him keys to a vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He told him those keys were found in Lloyd's pocket, Briggs said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Investigators did find keys to an SUV Hernandez rented in Lloyd's pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Briggs said he asked Hernandez if he was involved in Lloyd's killing, and Hernandez replied no.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He said he then looked in his eyes and asked if he was telling the truth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''He swore on his baby's life that he was telling the truth,'' Briggs said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Briggs said the following day, Hernandez showed up at Gillette Stadium, and Briggs asked him to leave, which Hernandez did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''You asked him to leave the stadium because his presence there was bad for business?'' Fee asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''That is correct,'' Briggs replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Hernandez was arrested June 26 in Lloyd's slaying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Less than two hours later, he was cut from the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Also Tuesday, lawyers said they expect to wrap up their cases next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>McCauley told the judge he expected to rest Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Hernandez lawyer James Sultan then asked the judge to hear arguments on some pending issues Friday and said he expected to put on witnesses and finish Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Both sides will also deliver closing arguments, then deliberations will begin.</td></tr>
