<h3>McGahon says Sinn F?in knew rapist abused child</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Paudie McGahon says he was raped by an IRA member when he was 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr McGahon said that although Sinn Fein representatives told him he could go to gardai in 2009 they also said that this could set back the recovery of the younger victim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said that in 2009 Sinn Fein knew that the man was living in Co Louth and posed a risk to children but did not go to gardai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He has called on families who used to provide safe houses for IRA members to ask their children if they had been abused and to tell them not to be afraid to come forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr McGahon said he knew there were other victims because the IRA told him that the man who raped him also abused others in other places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr McGahon also said that he believed Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams could find out the location of his alleged abuser because if then party TD Arthur Morgan knew that the man was back in the country in 2009, then Mr Adams would be able to find him now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a statement this afternoon, Mr Adams encouraged victims of sexual abuse to come forward and seek justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said any victim who came forward would have the full support of his party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fine Gael TD Regina Doherty said she believed that in 2006 there was an internal inquiry conducted by four senior members of Sinn Fein, where over 40 different cases of allegations of both physical and sexual abuse by republicans were investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Speaking on RTE's Six One News, she said that in 2014 Mr Adams acknowledged in the Dail that "Sinn Fein/IRA members" did investigate and in some cases kill, execute or exile republican abusers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ms Doherty said she believed that Sinn Fein needed to be held to the same scrutiny that the party demanded of the Catholic Church and the State with regard to their failings in connection with abuse claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She said that if there was real sincerity within the Sinn Fein party, whatever information it had needed to be shared with gardai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Minister for Education Jan O'Sullivan earlier told the Dail that it was her understanding that Sinn Fein conducted an investigation into abuse and there were about 100 cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Adams has refuted this allegation, saying that "would be totally inappropriate and could jeopardise a successful prosecution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Adams denied that his party was holding back information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Speaking during Leaders' Questions, Fianna Fail's Micheal Martin called for a commission of inquiry to look at the allegations of abuse and also those involved in the cover-up of such claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sinn Fein deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald appealed to victims and those with information to come forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She said it was the function of gardai to investigate such allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ms McDonald earlier said that she was as disturbed and upset as anybody else by Mr McGahon's abuse allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ms McDonald told RTE's Today with Sean O'Rourke that everybody needed to co-operate with the garda investigation and that Mr Adams had made it very clear that he would bring forward any information he had.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ms McDonald said that she respected the integrity of Mr McGahon's story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She said that Mr McGahon's alleged abuser needed to face the full rigours of the law and she urged anyone with information on the case to co-operate fully with gardai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She appealed to any other victims of abuse to come forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Speaking on the same programme, Mairia Cahill said Mr Adams was wrong in his assertion that it was the responsibility of an adult victim to go gardai with allegations of sexual abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Ms Cahill said that you did not need to have a victim to report a suspected abuser to the authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She said she herself had given the names of around 35 alleged abusers to gardai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Ms Cahill said Mr Adams' position should be put under more scrutiny.</td></tr>
