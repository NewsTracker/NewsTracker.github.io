<h3>Supreme court divided over challenge to Obamacare - video</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The US supreme court appeared divided on ideological lines on Wednesday as it heard a second major challenge to Barack Obama's healthcare law, targeting tax subsidies intended to help people afford insurance, with Justice Anthony Kennedy appearing to be the possible wing vote in a decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kennedy, a conservative on the nine-member court who often casts the deciding vote in close cases, raised concerns to lawyers on both sides about the possible negative impact on states if the government loses the case, suggesting he could back the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But he did not commit to supporting either side.</td></tr>
