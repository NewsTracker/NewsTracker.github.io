<h3>Kenya torches 15 tonnes of illegal ivory in anti-poaching fight</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kenya has burnt 15 tonnes of ivory and promised to destroy all of its stockpile this year in the latest step in its campaign against elephant poaching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Poaching has surged in the past few years across sub-Saharan Africa, where gangs kill elephants and rhinos to feed Asian demand for ivory and horns for use in folk medicines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A 2014 United Nations and Interpol report estimated that about 20,000 to 25,000 elephants were killed in Africa every year, out of a total population of as many as 650,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"As part of Kenya's continued policy to put ivory beyond economic use ... I will today burn 15 tonnes of ivory at this historic site in Nairobi National Park," president Uhuru Kenyatta said during a ceremony at the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"In order to underline our determination to eradicate poaching, my government shall burn the rest of the stockpile within this year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The ceremony was to mark the African Union-designated Wangari Maathai Day, in honour of the late environmentalist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and the World Wildlife Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kenya has imposed longer jail terms and bigger fines for wildlife poaching and trafficking, saying poaching is harming tourism, a major earner of foreign exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In January 2014, a Kenyan court convicted a Chinese man of smuggling ivory and ordered him to pay a fine of 20 million shillings ($233,000) or serve seven years in jail, the first sentencing since Kenya introduced the new anti-poaching law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Kenyan man has also been taken into police custody accused of being behind an international poaching syndicate involving elephant tusks and has been linked to a three-tonne haul of ivory seized in Mombasa last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Illegal trade in wildlife has become a sophisticated transnational form of crime, comparable to other pernicious examples, such as trafficking of drugs, humans, counterfeit items and oil," UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It is driven by rising demand and is often facilitated by corruption and weak governance. There is strong evidence of the increased involvement of organised crime networks and non-state armed groups."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 2011, then-president Mwai Kibaki set fire to five tonnes of contraband ivory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His predecessor, Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, did the same in 1989.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Photo: Kenya says poaching is harming tourism, a major earner of foreign exchange.</td></tr>
