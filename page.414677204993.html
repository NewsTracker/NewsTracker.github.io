<h3>Obama asks Congress for Islamic State war powers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>US president Barack Obama has asked Congress to back a global war against the Islamic State (IS) group, although included curbs on his ability to send in US ground forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The authority would, tantamount to a declaration of war, provide Mr Obama political cover at home and a firmer legal basis on which to prosecute the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a letter to politicians, Mr Obama said granting him war authority "would show the world we are united in our resolve" to defeat the jihadist militants, who now control swaths of Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Since mid-2014, the US military has been conducting a campaign of airstrikes against IS in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the request signals a ramping up of pressure on IS as the Iraqi government prepares for a major ground offensive, expected within months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>IS "poses a threat to the people and stability of Iraq, Syria, and the broader Middle East, and to US national security", Mr Obama said in the letter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If left unchecked," he added, IS "will pose a threat beyond the Middle East, including to the United States homeland".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia could not deploy ground troops to Iraq without the approval of the Iraqi Government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Abbott reaffirmed Australia's existing commitment of a training and advisory role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Well, we can't put ground troops into Iraq without the consent of the Iraqi Government, we have about 200 of our special forces on an advise and assist mission in Iraq at the moment," Mr Abbott told Fairfax radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Meanwhile, a Congressional hearing on Wednesday heard IS was "dangerously competent" in its use of social media for recruitment and inspiring attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Social media in particular has provided [IS] with the technical platform for widespread recruitment, operational direction and consequently, has helped bridge the gap between foreign fighters and home-grown extremists," said Michael Steinbach, assistant director of counter terrorism at the FBI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Senior officials warned there may be more foreign fighters in Syria than was already known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some estimate that Islamic State has as many as 50,000 fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>How many of those are American and have returned home remains unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Steinbech says there are a number of fighters that US authorities do not know about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"So certainly I would not be truthful if I told you that we knew about all the returnees," Mr Steinbach told the hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The recent attacks in Sydney, Ottawa and Paris were mentioned several times during the congressional hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>With the death of US hostage Kayla Mueller and the killing of three other US hostages, Mr Obama has been under pressure to re-examine his strategy and step up the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But in order to win the backing of the Republican-controlled Congress and overcome jitters within his own Democratic party, Mr Obama placed limits on his power to deploy the military in both form and scope.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The proposed legislation "does not authorise the use of the United States Armed Forces in enduring offensive ground combat operations", the draft sent to Congress read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That does not rule out special forces or hostage rescue operations, but does preclude a ground invasion or peace enforcement mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>An authorisation from the US Congress would also "terminate three years after the date of the enactment of this joint resolution, unless reauthorised".</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr Obama will also have to report to Congress every six months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>However there is no geographical limit on the scope of military actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>With the 2016 elections approaching and the bitter arguments over previous wars still seared in US political memory, Mr Obama was quick to make clear this would not be a sequel to Iraq or Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The text "would not authorise long-term, large-scale ground combat operations like those our nation conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan", Mr Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Local forces, rather than US military forces, should be deployed to conduct such operations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Bipartisan backing for the measure could help head off divisive party splits over the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, said the plan would face hearings and debate that he was sure of changes in Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I'm not sure the strategy that has been outlined will accomplish the mission the president says he wants to accomplish," he told reporters after a meeting of Republican House members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Republican senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, said he would "quickly begin to hold rigorous hearings" on the authorisation, which he supports.</td></tr>
