<h3>Greek PM Steps Down, Calls New Elections, In Wake Of Bailout Deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras leaves his office in Athens, on Thursday, hours before he announced he would step down as prime minister amid fresh elections, set for Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has announced that he will step down, paving the way for early elections following a bruising battle over austerity measures linked to a European bailout package that caused a major split in the leftist ruling party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We did not secure the agreement we wanted but it was the best we could do under the circumstances," Tsipras said in a nationally televised address Thursday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said Greece is obliged to fulfill the agreement but also to mitigate its adverse consequences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The political mandate of the January 25 elections has exhausted its limits and now the Greek people have to have their say," Tsipras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Shortly, I am going to submit my resignation and the resignation of my government to the president," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I will seek the vote of the Greek people to rule and continue our government program," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The date for the fresh elections, less than nine months after polls swept Syriza to power, is set for the elections is Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tsipras, a member of the Syriza party, pushed through a vote on the unpopular austerity measures that were a part of the third bailout in five years of the shaky Greek financial system, which has been teetering on the brink of default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As a condition of the bailout, Tsipras' government was forced to accept deep cuts to the state sector, including the pension system - a move that angered many ordinary Greeks, especially ruling party supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Mr Tsipras had won power on a manifesto of opposing the stringent austerity conditions that he has now accepted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He said he was forced to do so because a majority of Greeks wanted to stay in the eurozone, and this could not be achieved in any other way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Greece remains under strict capital controls, with weekly limits on cash withdrawals for Greek citizens."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The certainty is that the need for elections has arisen," Energy and Environment Minister Panos Skourletis said on state television earlier Thursday, according to The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The government "has lost its majority (in parliament) - one can't avoid this," he said.</td></tr>
