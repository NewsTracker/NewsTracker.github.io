<h3>Spain investigates Boko Haram leader on terror charges</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MADRID (AP) - Spain is opening a probe into Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau on suspicion of terrorism and crimes against humanity, under the legal principle of universal justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>National Court judge Fernando Andreu said in a ruling published Thursday the probe refers to an attack by the Nigerian militant group on Ganye in 2013 when a Spanish nun was subjected to molestation and coercion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The ruling says she managed to escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The court ruling asked authorities to locate the nun and requested information on Boko Haram from the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Spain tightened its law on universal justice last year, with a legal reform stipulating a Spanish victim must be involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Before that, the principle was famously used by former judge Baltasar Garzon in his attempts to prosecute former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.</td></tr>
