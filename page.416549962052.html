<h3>Probe bribery claim: Bali Nine lawyer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are keeping hope alive in their final hours, staying optimistic that justice will prevail before they're sent to the firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis returned from visiting the men on Nusakambangan on Monday with a still-wet painting by Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"They believe that the justice should prevail and I think this painting shows all of us we shouldn't give up hope," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The painting, titled The Second Last Day, was painted on Sunday night, Mr Lubis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This is a self-portrait of a Myuran Sukumaran full with optimism and I share the optimism of Sukumaran, the same with Andrew Chan," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He urged the judicial commission to pursue claims by Muhammad Rifan, the lawyer who represented the Bali Nine pair when they were sentenced to death in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rifan has finally detailed claims judges asked for more than $130,000 for a lighter sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Lubis says the president and attorney general must delay the executions planned for as soon as midnight on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Delay the executions for the sake of finding the truth, finding justice," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Lubis says all legal avenues available to spare the Sydney men have been explored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Taufiqurrahman Sahuri, one of the judicial commissioners, told AAP Mr Rifan's claims over the Bali Nine sentencing would be examined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"For that, we need to summon Rifan to explain the accusations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Will it affect the execution? That's another matter. The Judicial Commission is only an ethics body."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The pair have a constitutional court challenge lodged, which would require clarity around the president's obligations on answering clemency requests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The case is set down for a preliminary hearing on May 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Adding to their despair, the Chan and Sukumaran families lost more than three hours of precious time with their sons and brothers on Monday over bureaucratic red tape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They were turned away at Cilacap port followed by Australia's consul-general to Bali, Majell Hind, and lawyer Julian McMahon after being told the visitation rules had changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They were later allowed passage to Nusakambangan for what would be their second last visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It's understood they have been advised to say their last goodbyes in Tuesday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The notice given on Saturday advised of a minimum 72 hours to their executions but they could be done any time thereafter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Their friend, Pastor Arif Matius, explained the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The men were brought to the visitor's hall in Nusakambangan's Besi Prison in handcuffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The cuffs were released and when they were told the news separately, both were strong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He was angry and sad at the punishment, and the excessive force used for Chan, now a pastor himself, and Sukumaran, an accomplished painter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We will go down in history as a nation without mercy," Mr Arif told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says she's disappointed Indonesia ignored Australian government requests to delay the execution notices until after Anzac Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Despite the representations, Jakarta handed the pair their notices on Australia's "national day of remembrance", Ms Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott met French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Monday where they discussed the planned executions of nine prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"France and Australia share the same attachment to human rights and condemn the death penalty in all places and all circumstances," the French presidency said in a statement after a meeting between the two leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Frenchman Serge Atlaoui has been given a reprieve pending an appeals process, which followed strong diplomatic efforts by France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Citizens of Brazil, the Philippines, Nigeria, Ghana and Indonesia are set to face the firing squad with the Australians, all denied clemency as part of President Joko Widodo's war against drugs.</td></tr>
