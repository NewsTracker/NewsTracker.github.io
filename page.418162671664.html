<h3>The Latest: Greek banks to reopen to let pensioners get cash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Greek Finance Ministry says it will open about 1,000 bank branches across the country for three days this week to allow pensioners without bank cards to make withdrawals - but for a total of just 120 euros ($134) for the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was unclear why they would not be allowed to withdraw the 60-euro daily limit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Meanwhile, irate depositors called in to television stations to report that some ATMs in Athens had run out of 20-euro notes, leaving them dispensing 50 euro notes only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, has made a last-ditch effort to help Greece get a bailout deal, provided Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras campaigns for staying in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An EU official, official who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity for the talks, called it "a sort of last-minute offer" before Greece's bailout program runs out later and Athens needs to make a 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) debt payment to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Under the offer, Tsipras would need to write to Junker and other leaders saying he accepts the offer which was on the negotiating table last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He would also have to change his position on Sunday's referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tsipras has said he will urge a vote against creditors' proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The mood in European financial markets remained edgy amid growing expectations that Greece will not make a repayment to the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said Monday the payment would not be made if there is no deal with creditors over extending Greece's bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In early trading, the Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares was down 0.9 percent while Germany's DAX fell 0.7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Monday, stocks slid in the wake of Greece's decision to call a referendum for July 5 on creditors' bailout proposals and to impose controls on capital.</td></tr>
