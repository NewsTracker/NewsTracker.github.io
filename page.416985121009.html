<h3>Greece unblocks Piraeus port sale, invites binding bids</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, May 14 (Reuters) - Greece has asked three firms to submit binding bids by September for a majority stake in the country's biggest port, Piraeus, a senior privatisation official told Reuters on Thursday, unblocking a major asset sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece had shorlisted China's Cosco Group and four other groups for a 67 percent stake in Piraeus Port last year but the sale was halted after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's leftist government came to power this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Pressing ahead on the sale is expected to be one of the major concessions offered by Tsipras to EU and IMF lenders during ongoing talks to secure aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Athens late on Wednesday wrote to investors with an amended invitation to bid for 51 percent rather than the previous 67 percent stake, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Only three of the five initial bidders - Cosco, Dutch container terminal operator APM Terminals, and Philippines-based International Container Terminal Services - are still interested in the port, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It will be for 51 percent with an option to reach 67 percent in five years if they invest 300 million euros," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We want to name the winner at the end of September or early October."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The new leftist-led government is trying to renegotiate a 240-billion-euro bailout and has said it will review asset sales, but wants the state to remain involved in any privatisations.</td></tr>
