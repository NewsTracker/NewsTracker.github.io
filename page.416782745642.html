<h3>Netanyahu's efforts to form Israeli government go down to wire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM, May 6 (Reuters) - Benjamin Netanyahu, locked in down-to-the-wire coalition talks, faces a midnight deadline to form a government or risk being denied a fourth term as Israel's prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nearly two months after a convincing election victory, Netanyahu is struggling to build a solid parliamentary majority, with a former ally abandoning him this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The key to his political future now lies with the ultranationalist Jewish Home party, which advocates annexation of parts of occupied territory Palestinians seek for a state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Shortly after the March 17 vote, Netanyahu and his Likud party appeared to be coasting toward a right-leaning government with control of 67 of parliament's 120 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But on Monday, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, whose once-strong relationship with the Israeli leader turned sour long ago, dropped a bombshell by taking his far-right Yisrael Beitenu party out of the coalition talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That left Netanyahu with the support of two ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and a centrist faction, a total of 53 seats, making the addition of Jewish Home's eight legislators crucial for a majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Such a narrow government would make Netanyahu vulnerable to policy demands from even his most junior coalition partners, continuing a long tradition of unstable politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jewish Home is certain to push for the expansion of Jewish settlement in occupied territory, a policy that could deepen Israel's rift over the issue with its main ally, the United States, and the European Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The party's leader, Naftali Bennett, has called for the annexation of parts of the West Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That goes beyond Netanyahu's pledge to continue to build in settlements in areas Israel intends to keep in any future peace deal with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bennett is also a strong supporter of a bill, promoted by Netanyahu, that would anchor in law the status of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Critics, among them Israel's President Reuven Rivlin, have said it runs counter to the founding fathers' vision of equality for Arab citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Other proposed legislation likely to be pursued by a new Netanyahu government would seek to limit the power of the Supreme Court to overturn laws passed by parliament and tighten controls over foreign donations to left-wing organisations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Zeev Elkin, a Likud negotiator, said Bennett was demanding the justice minister portfolio for Jewish Home, a post critical to the smooth passage of cabinet-approved legislation to parliament for ratification.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I think this is extortion, I have no other way of describing it," Elkin said on Army Radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But political commentators predicted Netanyahu would bend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The 14-day extension Rivlin granted Netanyahu to announce a new government, after an original 28-day period ran out, expires at midnight (2100 GMT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Under Israeli law, Rivlin can then assign the task to another legislator, with Issac Herzog, leader of the centre-left Zionist Union, the likely candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A coalition pact between Netanyahu and Herzog would ensure a broad government, but the Zionist Union chief has not strayed from his post-election pledge to take to the opposition benches.</td></tr>
