<h3>Robert Durst indicted on weapon charge in New Orleans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The charge in Friday's indictment says Durst violated the federal gun-control act because he was in possession of a firearm after being convicted of earlier felonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The move came as no surprise: A federal criminal complaint outlining the allegation had been filed earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Durst now stands charged with offenses in three jurisdictions in two states: In California, he is charged in the 2000 slaying of Susan Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In New Orleans, where he was taken into custody at a hotel last month, he still faces weapons charges in state and federal courts.</td></tr>
