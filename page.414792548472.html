<h3>Schools are using STUDENTS to help interview for teachers?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Students as young as thirteen are interviewing prospective teachers for jobs in schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While Victorian schools have been praising the unusual hiring process, the Australian Education Union believes it isn't an appropriate place for the student voice to be heard and the responsibility of the employment of staff should be left to the principal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Peter Hutton, Principal of Templestowe College, has been running with the alternative hiring system for the past four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He told Daily Mail Australia that he thinks the process is 'fantastic' and up to 70 percent of the staff at the school have been employed using the unusual hiring method.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'Not only do they interview teaching staff but they also interview support staff and even assistant principals,' Mr Hutton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The students range in ages and Mr Hutton said in the past there have been Year 7 students involved in the selection process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'The students take it very very seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There have been very few occasions where we haven't agreed as a panel,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'To be honest if somebody wasn't prepared to be interviewed by students then they wouldn't be a good fit for us anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Meredith Peace said she strongly does not believe students should decide who is employed at Victorian schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'We don't support students being involved in the formal selection process of hiring staff,' Ms Peace said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ms Peace said that the students may have the best intentions but they do not possess the skills or expertise necessary to able to make such a judgement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'Students through no fault of their own haven't developed the skills and knowledge needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The selection process Is pretty rigorous and it requires people with an understanding of how that works,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Principal Hutton said the prospective employee is firstly taken into a room with three adults members of the panel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The person is interviewed and then sent into another room to face a selection of students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The panel of students is chaired by a senior student, who has had experience in interviewing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said the interviewees are told before they arrive that they will be questioned by students at the school during their interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The school has trained nearly 50 students to be interviewers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Firstly the students explore exactly what qualities they would like in a teacher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Then they divide up into small groups and work out some appropriate questions that will give them an estimation as to how suitable the applicant will be for the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The students' interview with the prospective employee usually last about 15 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'I never fail to be impressed by their honesty,' Mr Hutton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'Some of the comments that I've heard expressed today by members of the public (about the hiring method) just shatter me at the lack of faith that they have in students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tess Shacklock from the Victorian Student Representative Council sits on a selection panel that is part of the hiring process at Templestowe College.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She believes the process helps to build a strong student-teacher relationship as makes it easier for students to develop a connection with the new member of staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She said a normal interview technique would be to ask the interviewee a scenario question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'Asking questions like that we'd receive a more open-ended and extended answer, which gives you a better insight into how that individual would teach,' Ms Shacklock said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The 17-year-old who is in Year 12 at the school said she can't understand why people would think students should not be involved in the hiring process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>'We are just as capable as a teacher is to interview a fellow teacher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>We have all the experience of being in a classroom and observing what it's like to teach and what's it like to be taught, so why wouldn't we be on the panel that decides who will be our teacher,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>13-year-old Kyle Meredith-Peck, who is also on the selection panel at Templestowe College, believes that students gain more respect for their teachers after becoming involved in selecting them for employment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'The best thing is to get a balance between respect, kindness and knowledge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>I think if you can balance that out you're going to get really good teachers,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Both Tess and Kyle agree that the top traits they look for in a prospective teacher are for them to be; approachable, knowledgeable, kindness and respect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>An Education Department of NSW spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the practice of involving students in employment processes does not exist in public schools in the state.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali Nine's Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to be moved to Nusakambangan island this week, authorities say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two Australian Bali Nine members on death row in Indonesia will be transferred this week to the most notorious prison on Nusakambangan island, known as Indonesia's Alcatraz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The head of the Bali prosecutors' office confirmed on Monday afternoon that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be taken to the maximum security Batu prison on the penal island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The name of the jail, which was built in 1925, means stone prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ten officers from the paramilitary force Brimob will escort the two men to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Momock Bambang Samiarso said the transfer would not take place on Monday - and was unlikely to happen on Tuesday - but would definitely happen this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Samiarso said he would notify the families as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed on Monday he made a further plea for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's lives to Indonesian President Joko Widodo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And a judge involved in handing down the death sentence to the two drug smugglers has denied allegations there was political intervention or bribery in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Attorney-General spokesman Tony Spontana said earlier that condemned drug felons from Bali's infamous Kerobokan jail, where Chan and Sukumaran are on death row, will be the first transferred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They would be later joined by felons from prisons in Madiun and Yogyakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Only after everybody is gathered at Nusakambangan will the D-day be decided," Mr Spontana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Eleven prisoners on death row for drug and murder charges are expected to be killed in the second round of executions in Indonesia this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Of these, seven drug felons are foreigners from Australia, the Philippines, France, Brazil, Nigeria and Ghana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Abbott said he felt "sick in the pit of my stomach" when he thought about what was happening to Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Abbott would not provide further information on his overtures to Mr Joko because he did not want it to come down to a test of strength.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"If we do turn this into a test of strength, I think we are much more likely to back the Indonesians into a corner than to get the result we want," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's legal team have written to the Indonesian judicial committee requesting an investigation into allegations of political interference and bribery when the death sentence was imposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said these were very serious allegations and she understood the lawyers would continue to raise these matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However a judge involved in the case, Wayan Yasa Abadi, denied there had been political interference or bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said he would respond if summonsed by the judicial committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meanwhile, a new Lowy Institute poll has found that 62 per cent of Australians oppose the execution of Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>This is in contrast to an earlier Roy Morgan poll - seized upon by the Indonesian government to justify the executions - which found that 52 per cent supported the death penalty for Australian drug traffickers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The earlier poll was criticised for being crude and misleading due to the rubbery nature of the questions asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>According to the Lowy poll, 69 per cent of the population do not believe the death penalty should be applied for drug trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Executive director of the Lowy Institute Michael Fullilove said Australian public and political opposition was crystallising as the date of the execution drew closer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>August, 2005: Indonesian police - acting on information passed onto them by the Australian Federal Police - arrest nine Australians at Denpasar airport for attempting to smuggle heroin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>September, 2006: Prime Minister John Howard refuses to intervene on behalf of the "Bali Nine".</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"There are still matters potentially to be heard before Indonesian courts," he said at the time, claiming he did not want to jeopardise the defendants' case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>July, 2007: Mr Howard raises the issue with Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono: "I thought it was appropriate to mention the fact that it's an issue that attracts a lot of interest in Australia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>December: Prime minister Kevin Rudd tells Mr Yudhoyono that if any of the Bali Nine still faced the death penalty when all legal avenues had been pursued, he would plead for clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>August, 2010: Letter from the AFP is submitted to the Indonesian court, stating Scott Rush only played a minor role in the drug-smuggling ring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>AFP commissioner Mick Keelty also testifies in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Mr Rush's death sentence is reduced to life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>May, 2013: Foreign affairs minister Bob Carr defends the government's handling of the Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran cases "We urge them to grant the clemency appeals but we do so having respect with Indonesia to make its own laws."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Mr Carr says he has spoken about the matter with his Indonesian counterpart at their meetings, as had prime minister Julia Gillard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>January 17, 2015: Prime Minister Tony Abbott writes directly to Indonesian President Joko Widodo for mercy regarding Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>January 20: Mr Abbott renews direct appeal for clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>February 6: Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop and Mr Abbott say the government is doing "whatever [it] humanly can" behind the scenes to keep the pair alive, while considering recalling the Australian ambassador to Indonesia if Chan and Sukumaran are executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>February 12: Ms Bishop and Shadow Foreign Minister Tanya Plibersek both address parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Bishop says 11 written representations have been made since January 7, from the Prime Minister, the Governor-General, the Foreign Minister, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>She says she has spoken to her Indonesian counterpart "many times".</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>More than 55 personal representations at the ministerial and prime ministerial levels have been made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>February 14: Ms Bishop warns on radio that Australian tourists may choose to boycott Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>February 16: Mr Abbott tells media he has personally reiterated his concerns to Mr Widodo.</td></tr>
