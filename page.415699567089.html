<tr><td>34</td><td>Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers ended at 10.53am at an altitude of about 6000 feet [1.8 kilometres]. The plane then crashed," Germanwings' managing director Thomas Winkelmann told journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses the media in Berlin following the plane crash on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>First image of Germanwings crash site revealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Experts said that that, while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>France's DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase," a DGAC spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then to pay attention to navigation and only then to communicate with the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The Airbus 320 had been in continuous operation with Lufthansa and then Germanwings since 1991.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>It had a routine check in Dusseldorf the day before the crash, and a regular extensive inspection in mid-2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Nothing irregular had been identified - although the airlines will now review their inspection logbooks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The captain had more than 10 years' experience, including 6000 flight-hours on Airbus models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The A320 is a workhorse of worldwide aviation fleets.</td></tr>

<tr><td>48</td><td>Mr Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa Technik on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Ms Bishop addressed the Australian media on Wednesday morning to confirm that at least two Australians were among the dead, but declined to provide further personal information.</td></tr>

<tr><td>51</td><td>Ms Bishop said her department was now working to confirm whether there were any other citizens, dual nationals or Australian residents on board the flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in north-west Germany, who were returning from a short exchange program in Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Students and teachers at the school broke down in tears after receiving the news on Tuesday, and many attended a candlelight vigil in the afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Opera stars bass-baritone Oleg Bryjak, 54, and contralto Maria Radner, 33, were also on board, flying to their home city of Duesseldorf after starring in Richard Wagner's Siegfried at Barcelona's opera house, the Gran Teatre del Liceu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Radner was travelling with her husband and baby, the BBC reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Lufthansa vice-president Heike Birlenbach said the biggest priorities for the airline were to support relatives and friends of the victims, and to focus on investigating the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The airline was looking at whether it was feasible to fly relatives to the scene of the accident, and they would be told on Wednesday whether it was possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>She could not give the nationalities of the passengers, she said, because the airline didn't want to "just assume by name" whether they were Spanish, German or another nationality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>As it was a flight within Europe, passengers did not necessarily need to produce their passports to board the flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>French President Francois Hollande said he could not be sure if there were French passengers on board the flight, describing the crash as a "terrible event".</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>"We are in mourning," Mr Hollande said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>The accident is the first air disaster in France since the Concorde tragedy in 2000 in which 113 died.</td></tr>

<tr><td>72</td><td>"It is particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children, some of them infants," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Mr Obama said America stood with Germany and Spain in this moment of sorrow, and said he would offer any assistance needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Le Parisien reported a witness from the area who said she "heard a big thud and then I saw a column of smoke".</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>The woman from the town of Vernet, near the crash scene, said the noise was a little like the sound of dynamite sometimes used to trigger avalanches.</td></tr>
