<h3>Gen. Petraeus expected to plead guilty to federal charges</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(CNN)Gen. David Petraeus pleaded guilty Tuesday to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information as part of a plea deal, court documents show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to the documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On November 9, 2012, he resigned from his CIA post, citing personal reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Petraeus allegedly provided classified intelligence to his lover, Broadwell, while he was director of the CIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The married mother of two and former military officer was writing a book about the general at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>During his time as commander in Afghanistan, Petraeus kept personal notes including classified information in eight 5-by-8 inch black notebooks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The classified information including identity of covert officers, war strategy, notes from diplomatic and national security meetings and security code words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In August 2011, according to the court documents, Petraeus dropped off the notebooks to a house in Washington, D.C., so Broadwell could access them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He later retrieved them and brought them to his home in Arlington, Va.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After Petraeus resigned in 2012 he told the government he had no classified materials in his possession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That turned out not to be true when the FBI in April 2013 conducted a search of his house and found the black notebooks in an unlocked desk drawer in a first floor study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>When he was questioned by the FBI, he lied and claimed that he had never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it, according to the court documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The relationship came to light during an FBI investigation into a complaint that Broadwell was allegedly sending harassing e-mails to another woman who was close to Petraeus, a U.S. official told CNN in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Lawyers for Petraeus declined to comment.</td></tr>
