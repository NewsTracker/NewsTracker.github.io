<h3>Bali Nine legal processes not done: Labor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Acting Labor leader Tanya Plibersek says Indonesia is seriously damaging its ability to plead for its own citizens in trouble overseas when it continues to ignore pleas to stop the execution of two Australians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Convicted Bali Nine drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan could be executed as soon as Tuesday after being given the minimum of 72 hours notice on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I believe it seriously damages the ability of Indonesia to plead for its own citizens internationally when it is ignoring the pleas of countries such as Australia for the lives of our citizens," she told reporters in Sydney on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ms Plibersek said it was vital that Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop contact their Indonesian counterparts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is unacceptable that while there are still legal processes under way that this sentence should be carried out," Ms Plibersek said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She said it wasn't the time to speculate on what might if the executions went ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I think the time now is to focus on what we might do to delay the application of this sentence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ms Bishop said on Saturday the government will continue to seek clemency from Indonesian President Widodo for both men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Abbott has called Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 34, "well and truly reformed characters" after their decade in prison for the foiled heroin smuggling plot.</td></tr>
