<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PITTSBURGH - A Pittsburgh radio station has suspended a disc jockey over his online posting about the arrest record of a Baltimore man whose fatal injury in police custody led to rioting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Officials at FM station WAMO 100 said Wednesday the posting by Mike Jax was "too controversial" and partly inaccurate.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Jax has been suspended for at least two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He posted on Instagram a list of criminal charges he said Freddie Gray had faced in recent years and the comment, "He was pretty busy before he was unjustly killed at the hands of Baltimore PD. #prayforbaltimore."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jax apologized online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He says he wasn't trying to justify Gray's death, but just the opposite.</td></tr>
