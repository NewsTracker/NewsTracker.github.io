<h3>Islamic State video shows killing of teen accused as Israeli spy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BEIRUT (Reuters) - A video posted online by Islamic State militants on Tuesday showed a boy fatally shooting Muhammad Musallam, an Israeli Arab accused by the group of having signed up as a jihadi to spy for Israel's intelligence service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The video, published by the group's Furqan media outlet, showed Musallam, 19, sitting in a room wearing an orange jumpsuit, talking about how he had been recruited and trained by Mossad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said his father and elder brother had encouraged him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After that, it showed Musallam being escorted to a field and then being shot in the head by a boy, described by an older, French-speaking fighter as one of the "cubs of the caliphate".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage, which also appeared on Twitter feeds used by Islamic State supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Israeli security officials said they were aware of the video but could not confirm that it was authentic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The video, about 13 minutes long, showed Musallam on his knees when the boy armed with a pistol and wearing a military uniform fires one bullet into Musallam's forehead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The boy then fired three more shots into his body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the video, Musallam said he had joined Islamic State to report to the Israelis on weapons caches, bases and Palestinian recruits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Israel and his family denied that he was an Israeli spy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Israeli security official had said Musallam went to Syria to fight for Islamic State in October last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Musallam's father has denied his son was a spy, saying a month ago that his son had gone missing while on a tourist trip to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Said Musallam and the youth's mother, Um Ahmad, wept at their home in East Jerusalem when they learned of his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Clutching her son's photograph, Um Ahmad told reporters: "A spy of 19? How is that possible? Why would he have gone there if he were a spy?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Said Musallam said his son had been trying to return home when he was captured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He accused the militants of forcing his son to say he was a spy before killing him just for show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Mohammad was told by them to say about himself that he works for the Israelis," Said Musallam said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"They took him as a victim, only to show the world, so the world would be afraid of them."</td></tr>
