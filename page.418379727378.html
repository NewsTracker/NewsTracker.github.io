<h3>Mickelson refuses to comment on money-laundering allegations (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>US golfer Phil Mickelson answers questions from the media during a preview day ahead of the Scottish Open at Gullane Golf Club, Gullane Scotland Wednesday July 8, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Five-time major champion Phil Mickelson has refused to comment on allegations linking him to an illegal gambling operation, saying he had got used to being an "object to be discussed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Speaking Wednesday ahead of the Scottish Open, Mickelson says "the fact is I'm comfortable enough with who I am as a person that I don't feel I need to comment on every little report that comes out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>ESPN reported last week that $2.75 million belonging to Mickelson was transferred to a former sports gambling handicapper, who pleaded guilty to laundering money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''The fact is, I'm comfortable enough with who I am as a person that I don't feel I need to comment on every little report that comes out,'' Mickelson said, when asked for a response to the ESPN report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>ESPN reported that Mickelson, one of the biggest names in the sport, hasn't been charged with a crime and isn't under federal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gregory Silveira of La Quinta, California, pleaded guilty to three counts of money laundering of funds from an unnamed gambling client of his between February 2010 and February 2013, according to ESPN, and is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''When I started to understand that I was more of an object to be discussed, it took out the personal element of when people say things,'' Mickelson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''People are going to say things good, they are going to say things bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''We don't agree with those comments but we are appreciative of what he's done to promote the game of golf, and that puts everybody in a tough spot,'' Mickelson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, is facing a backlash, with the PGA of America announcing Tuesday it is moving the Grand Slam of Golf from his course in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>NBC, Univision and Macy's are among several businesses that already have cut ties to Trump over his comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Trump has a long-standing relationship with golf, however, and his remarks about Mexican immigrants - who, he has claimed, are ''criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc'' in many cases - have placed golf in a difficult situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While Mickelson is a high-profile player to speak out, fellow American Ryder Cup players Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker, who are also playing the Scottish Open in Gullane this week, didn't want to weigh into the controversy Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mickelson is back on Scotland's east coast for the first time since winning the 2013 British Open at Muirfield, a course situated a short walk from Gullane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 45-year-old American hasn't won a tournament since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I am going to stop by (Muirfield),'' said Mickelson, who has his family with him in Scotland this week - just as he did in 2013 when he won the Scottish and British Opens in successive weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''I'd love to just walk the back nine again.</td></tr>
