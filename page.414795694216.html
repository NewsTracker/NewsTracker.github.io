<h3>Liberia schools reopen after 6-month Ebola closure</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the capital, lines formed outside entrances where returning students' temperatures were being taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ebola's main symptom is a high fever, and only those who are sick can spread the deadly virus to others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Deputy Education Minister Remses Kumbuyah said more than 5,000 kits were distributed to schools that included thermometers and chlorine for hand-washing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They should wash their hands in chlorine and they should ensure that there is no touching while on campus," the minister told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are asking all the school administrators to ensure that a classroom should not have more than 45 or 50 students."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Overcrowding is a major problem in Liberia's schools, where as many as 100 pupils may be in a single classroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Since Ebola is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, administrators want to minimize the potential spread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ebola has killed more than 3,800 people in Liberia, and while only a handful of cases remain health officials have warned that a single new case could trigger a whole new cluster of infections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nearly 9,200 people have died since the first Ebola deaths in rural Guinea in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The disease ravaged through Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - all countries with weak health systems that were ill-prepared for such an epidemic.</td></tr>
