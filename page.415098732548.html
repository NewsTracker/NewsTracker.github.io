<h3>Dame Judi Dench wants Johnny Depp for third 'Exotic Marigold' movie</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But do not dismiss them callously nor assume they are ready for either the chill of retirement or the spectre of death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Each one - especially Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Celia Imrie and Lillete Dubey, who show up for interviews, and co-stars Richard Gere, Ronald Pickup, Penelope Wilton and Maggie Smith, who do not - are too feisty, too fit and too damned determined to fade away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I mean," says the witty Nighy in an interview at the swank Claridge's Hotel London, "I don't want to die or anything. I really don't. I have no enthusiasm for it. Like we all do, I suppose, I still ask: 'Is that really going to happen?' Yes, it's really going to happen. But I've been fortunate that I'm upright and healthy and I've enjoyed some successes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Colleagues of the 65-year-old Nighy, who mostly range in age from their early 60s to a pair of 80-year-olds in Dame Maggie Smith and Dame Judith Dench, do fight the dying of the light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In life, and in the Exotic Marigold movies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This is exactly why John Madden's original edition became a surprise sleeper hit in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It cost a mere $10 million to make and earned $137 million in worldwide box office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Audiences in English-speaking countries, plus a lot of folks in Japan, Germany and Spain, fell in love with the eccentric seniors played by Dench, Nighy, Imrie, Wilton, Smith, Diana Hardcastle and Tom Wilkinson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As they tried to carve out a life at a chaotic retirement hotel in India, their lives were renewed, romantic sparks were ignited and viewers smiled happily with the bittersweet comic turns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The sequel brings most of the core group, with the obvious exception of Wilkinson, back for a return visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This time, the British seniors are joined by 65-year-old American movie star Gere and by a relative youngster, 47-year-old English actress Tamsin Greig.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The setting is again the same Best Exotic Marigold Hotel run by the youthful go-getter played by Dev Patel (of Slumdog Millionaire fame).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We jumped up and down, didn't we?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Imrie says with girlish glee of being invited back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We certainly did!" agrees acting legend Dench, who famously played M in seven James Bond pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I don't know if you know India but, if you're paid to go to India for eight weeks one year, and four years later you go back, that's it! Paid to be there! Just learn the lines. Get on with it. Do it as well as you can. And what is wonderful - and a huge compliment to John - is that I think 70% of the original Indian crew were back on the sequel. So we knew everybody's names and that's a bonus."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The only downside was having to get on the back of a motorcycle again with cycle-fearing, clenched-handed Nighy in the driver's seat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Both feared for their lives shooting those scenes for the first movie in 2010 and again for the sequel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Actually, Nighy's primary concern was surviving a wreck but finding Dench dead in the mayhem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The woman is a living icon, and he wanted to keep it that way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"As I quipped on the first movie," Nighy confesses, "you could kill the Queen and still sneak back into the country. You kill Judi Dench and you wander the world for the rest of your life, stateless. You're never coming home, that's for f---ing sure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That kind of gallows humour underscores a unique bit of business involving the two Exotic Marigold movies: The core group of actors have all known and worked with each other for decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I've worked with Judi Dench a lot and most of my work on these films is with her," Nighy says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The first time I worked with her, it was daunting! But she is such a remarkable person. And she is a wonderful artist, obviously. She is very easy. She is a democrat, in the real sense of the word. She is easy and classy to do business with, and she makes you feel very comfortable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Casting his net wider, Nighy explains how the entire core cast is like family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"It was nice to go back to India with this bunch of people. I've known them all my life. I've been married (on-screen) to Penelope Wilton at least twice before. I've been her doctor. I've had letter-sex with her on the radio. I've known Tom Wilkinson since I was 25. I was at drama school with Celia Imrie and I've known her since she was 16. I've been Judi's sort-of love interest four times or something. I've worked with her on-stage and on-camera. And I've known Maggie through the years. I've grown up with all these people and we all basically, more or less, have a theatre background. So that's a small community. So you're bound to know one another."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Dench reinforces the notion: "We've all worked together!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That familiarity let them play out the story-lines of both Exotic Marigold movies with ease, she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>On the first movie, their relationships helped audiences click in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"It was about a lot of people over a certain age who didn't give up, who were all prepared to take on a risk of some kind and had a bit in life in them. People think you should be sitting nicely in a chair and watching television all the time and not getting up to learn something new - or not falling in love again - or not getting cross or angry. It's boring! Somehow, the older you get the more blanked out it should be - and I think all of these people have a different attitude towards that!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Dench certainly does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Asked about a third Exotic Marigold movie and she bubbles with enthusiasm before naming the outsider she would most like to have join the cast and "come play with them" in India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Johnny Depp!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Dench says instantly, referring to the man who, as Captain Jack Sparrow, robbed her character in a cameo appearance in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Especially playing with me!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>I ask her why Johnny, what is the magic?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Please," she says with a twinkle in her eye and a growl in her voice, "how could you ask the question: 'What is the magic in Johnny Depp?' Sex, of course!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mainstream movies featuring senior citizens may be rare, but they are a regular occurrence and some are wonderful entertainment for audiences of any age.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>In honour of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, we look at some highlights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Given that both Marigold movies are romantic comedies, the focus here is on inspirational and uplifting titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>That eliminates brilliant tragedies such as Amour and Away From Her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The Trip to Bountiful (1985): Geraldine Page is luminous in the simple yet profound story of a journey home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Cocoon (1985): With aliens, a rejuvenating swimming pool and enterprising seniors, Ron Howard's sci-fi fantasy is heaps of fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The Bridges of Madison County (1995): Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep share a brief but potent romantic interlude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>About Schmidt (2002): Eccentric Jack Nicholson hits the road in his RV on a journey of self-discovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Gran Torino (2008): Starring in his own film, Clint Eastwood plays a grumpy war vet who gets a new lease on life after his vintage car is stolen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Up (2009): In Pete Docter's animated masterwork, an elderly widower prefers adventure to a nursing home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Quartet (2012): Dustin Hoffman directs Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Billy Connolly et al in a delightful saga about music, ego and age.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Still Mine (2012): James Cromwell plays a New Brunswick retiree who defies bureaucracy to build a new and safer home for his ailing wife, Genevieve Bujold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>10 Honourable mentions: Calendar Girls, Driving Miss Daisy, Fried Green Tomatoes, Grumpy Old Men, Strangers in Good Company, The Bucket List, The Notebook, The Sunshine Boys, Venus, Secondhand Lions.</td></tr>

<h3>Russian opposition mourns murdered leader Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>People gather at the spot where Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in the center of Moscow on Feb. 28, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Thousands of stunned Russians laid flowers and lit candles on Saturday on the bridge where opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was shot dead near the Kremlin, a murder that showed the risks of speaking out against President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, was shot four times in the back by assailants in a white car as he walked across the bridge over the Moskva River in central Moscow with a Ukrainian woman, who was unhurt, just before midnight on Friday, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police sealed off the blood-stained bridge close to the red walls of the Kremlin and Red Square for two hours overnight, then hosed it down as people came to pay tribute to one of Putin's biggest opponents over Russia's role in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Flowers were piled at least three feet high, about two meters deep and two meters wide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A piece of white paper saying "We are all Nemtsov" stood among the flowers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"People are afraid to support our movement. Opposition activists receive threats every day and Boris was no exception. But they won't stop us," said opposition activist Mark Galperin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A former deputy prime minister who had feared he would be murdered, Nemtsov was the most prominent opposition figure killed in Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His gangland-style killing was reminiscent of the chaotic 1990s after the Communist Soviet Union collapsed and raised further questions about the opposition's ability to mount any challenge to Putin in such a dangerous environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Kremlin deflected accusations that it was to blame and Putin called for the killers to be found quickly, taking the investigation under presidential control and denouncing what he said was a "provocation" before an opposition protest on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the killing focused attention on the tough treatment of opponents in Putin's third term, during which several leading critics have been jailed or have fled the country following mass rallies against the president, a former KGB spy, three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"That a leader of the opposition could be shot beside the walls of the Kremlin is beyond imagination. There can be only one version: that he was shot for telling the truth," Mikhail Kasyanov, an opposition leader and a former prime minister under Putin, said at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There was no claim of responsibility, though police were following several lines of inquiry and looking at surveillance camera footage in one of Moscow's busiest and most guarded areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev cautioned against jumping to conclusions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Certain forces will try to use the killing to their own advantage. They are thinking how to get rid of Putin," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Leading international condemnation of the murder, U.S. President Barack Obama called for a prompt, impartial and transparent investigation to ensure those responsible were brought to justice for the "vicious killing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some opposition figures blamed the Kremlin directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Others depicted Russian society as in moral decline, describing an environment where Putin demands total loyalty and supporters go to great lengths to do what they think may please him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"In Putin's atmosphere of hatred and violence, abroad and in Russia, bloodshed is the prerequisite to show loyalty, that you are on the team," another opposition leader, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"If Putin gave (the) order to murder Boris Nemtsov is not the point. It is Putin's dictatorship. His 24/7 propaganda about enemies of the state."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Nemtsov, who had been out walking on Great Moskvoretsky Bridge after a meal in a restaurant by Red Square, had said in a recent interview he was concerned that the president might want him dead over his opposition to the conflict in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Boris periodically received anonymous threats on social networking sites ... Boris was worried," said opposition politician Ilya Yashin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sunday's opposition march is intended to protest against the war in east Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels have seized a swathe of territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Kiev, the West and some Russians accuse Moscow of sending troops to support the rebels, an accusation Russia has repeatedly denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tall, with a mop of black curly hair that had started to turn gray, Nemtsov often dressed casually in big sweaters and was known for booming speeches criticizing Putin at rallies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Organizers of Sunday's march were divided after Nemtsov's death over whether to hold the rally or turn it into a demonstration of mourning in central Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Some feared it could end in violence if police acted with a heavy hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Police said they were following several lines of inquiry, including a possible attack to destabilize the political situation in Russia or an attack by radical Islamists on a well-known Jew, but political murders often go unsolved in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Nemtsov's criticism of Putin won him support among Moscow's intellectuals and the nascent middle class but he had little support outside the big cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Another opposition figure, Ksenia Sobchak, said Nemtsov had been preparing a report on the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Nemtsov was a fighter against corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In other reports, he condemned overspending on the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics by the Russian authorities and listed the many state buildings, helicopters and planes that Putin has at his disposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He was also one of the leaders of the rallies in the winter of 2011-12 that became the biggest protests against Putin since he first rose to power in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Nemtsov briefly served as a deputy prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin in the late 1990s, when he gained a reputation as a leading liberal economic reformer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The opposition has failed to dent Putin's popularity even though many people feel the pain of Western economic sanctions over Ukraine, low oil prices and poor economic management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Opposition blogger Alexei Navalny is serving a 15-day jail term, preventing him attending Sunday's march.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Kasparov is based in the United States and former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, freed in late 2013 after a decade in jail, lives in Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Some opponents say they fear for their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Anna Politkovskaya, an investigative journalist, was shot dead outside her Moscow apartment on Putin's birthday in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The person who ordered the killing has never been identified.</td></tr>
