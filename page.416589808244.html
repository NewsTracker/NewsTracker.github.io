<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Katie Medley and her husband Caleb, seen in this undated photo, were in the Century 16 theater in Aurora, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>on the night of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Their son Hugo, seen at left, was born two days later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A woman who was nine months pregnant on the night of the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, took the stand today as the first witness in the trial, recalling in chilling detail how she had to make an agonizing decision when she saw that her husband was gravely injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Katie Medley said that she and her friend Ashley ducked to the ground when she saw the shooter come into the theater but couldn't understand why her husband Caleb was sitting up in his seat as shots were being fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I looked up and ... that's when I saw blood pouring from his face and I knew he had been shot in the head," Medley testified in Arapahoe County Court this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Caleb Medley survived the gunshot, but he was gravely injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Today is the second day of the trial against James Holmes, who is accused of killing 12 people and injuring 70 others during the July 2012 attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He faces the death penalty if convicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>During the opening statements on Monday, Holmes' defense team admitted that he was responsible for the attack but entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If he is found not guilty on those grounds, he would be committed indefinitely to a state mental institution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But if he were later deemed sane, he could, theoretically, be released, though legal experts say that is unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>After Katie Medley testified for roughly an hour, Caleb Medley was called to testify from his wheelchair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His speech was seriously impaired due to the shooting and he used an alphabet board and interpreter to answer questions from the attorneys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was asked just three questions from prosecutors -- his name, the fact that he is married to Katie Medley, and whether he was at the theater on the night of the shooting -- before being released from the stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The defense did not have any questions for either of the Medleys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Katie Medley used her time on the stand to detail the shooting and the months of operations and rehabilitation that her husband had to go through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>PHOTO: Caleb Medley, who was shot in the head during the massacre at the theater in Aurora, Colo., is shown during the opening day of the trialshooting suspect James Holmes, April 27, 2015, in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Some of the most chilling moments came when she described how she saw the shooter, now known to be Holmes, throw two canisters into the air from the side door and then start shooting while wearing a mask and a Kevlar vest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After the initial string of shots and when she was crouching down on the floor, she said she saw him walk past her row and thought that he may have left the theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I decided to slowly stand up and I saw that Caleb was actually breathing. ... He was choking on all of his blood," Katie Medley said, telling how she tried clearing the blood with a bottle of water before police told them to get out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I told Ashley that we had to make a decision, that we had to stay or go but because I was so pregnant I had to," Medley said, adding how she thought her baby was "going to be the last piece of him to survive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"One of the hardest things I ever had to do was calling my parents and Caleb's parents," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"They were all expecting me to call to say I was in labor and instead I got to tell them all that Caleb had been shot and was probably dead."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>PHOTO: An overhead view of activities at the Century 16 theater east of the Aurora Mall in Aurora, Colo., July 20, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Katie Medley was scheduled to be induced into labor on what would have been two days after the shooting, and doctors followed through with that timeline, though her labor took up to 40 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>While she was in labor, Caleb was in his third brain surgery, she said, noting that he first held their son Hugo, who is now 3 years old, was while he was in a medically induced coma that lasted nearly a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Katie Medley said that her husband can understand everything anyone says but he has great difficulty communicating back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>One of the shotgun pellets went through his right eye and damaged the right side of his brain that has impaired his speech as well as the strength of his left side, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He lost his eye and uses a wheelchair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The three next witnesses were friends who went to the movie together with a fourth friend who died in the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Derick Spruel and his wife ChiChi accompanied two of his colleagues from a local Air Force base went to the movies that night in spite of ChiChi's bad feeling about the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The couple testified today that they had previously been to that particular theater and they had a bad experience, with "sticky floors" and sub-par service and they had vowed not to go back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I was really about to turn around but my husband said 'Jessie bought the tickets. We're going to go,' and I said ok," ChiChi Spruel testified today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The court heard two 911 calls made by ChiChi, who said she initially thought the explosions were fireworks that were set off as part of a prank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Her husband said he thought so too at first but recognized the sound of a rifle moments later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Once I identified the [rifle], I was pretty sure someone was going to walk through the aisles shooting," Derick Spruel said.</td></tr>
