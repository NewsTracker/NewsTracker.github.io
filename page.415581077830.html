<tr><td>3</td><td>During the final days of the campaign, Mr Netanyahu said he would not agree to establish a Palestinian state in the current climate - a position that drew heavy criticism from Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The two-state solution is a key US foreign policy objective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Netanyahu said he believes Israel cannot yield captured land to the Palestinians because it will be taken over by Islamic extremists, but said he would support Palestinian independence if circumstances change.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>A day before the election Mr Netanyahu told the nrg news website that a Palestinian state would not be established on his watch because of the current climate in the region.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>When asked if that means a Palestinian state will not be established if he is elected, he replied: "Indeed."</td></tr>
