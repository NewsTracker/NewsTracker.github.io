<h3>House passes GOP bills targeting EPA's 'secret science'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A bill approved Wednesday would require the EPA to disclose scientific data behind proposed regulations, while a measure passed Tuesday would prohibit the agency from appointing registered lobbyists to the EPA's Science Advisory Board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Both were approved largely along party lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The scientific data bill was approved 241-175, while the advisory board measure was approved 236-181.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Republicans said the bills would increase transparency at the EPA and make it more accountable to the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Right now, the EPA is trying to impose harmful regulations based on scientific studies that no one can check - not the public, not independent scientists, not even the United States Congress,' said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If the EPA or any other agency proposes a rule that adds costs to businesses or infringes on private property, "the people have every right to know why," McCarthy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The White House has threatened to veto the measures, saying they could delay or prevent environmental decisions and hurt the ability of the science board to advise the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If adopted into law, the bill on scientific data could be used to prevent EPA from proposing or finalizing a regulation until legal challenges about the legitimate withholding of certain scientific and technical information are resolved, the White House said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Releasing data underlying some scientifically important studies could violate the privacy of test subjects or compromise confidential business information, the White House said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Similarly, the White House said the measure restricting service on the EPA's Science Advisory Board could preclude the nomination of scientists with significant expertise in their fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., dismissed the bills as attempts by "corporate interests to compromise the EPA's integrity" and stock its science review board with business sympathizers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The claim of "'secret science' might sound scary, but the rhetoric has outpaced the reality," Hastings said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This bill will not improve EPA science or make it more transparent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Frank Lucas, R-Okla., said some members of the EPA's Science Advisory Board have received grant money from the agency or expressed policy preferences in the same areas they are asked to study independently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The heavy costs of EPA's regulations warrant some degree of public oversight to ensure SAB's findings are free from bias or conflicts of interest and not simply provided by a set of hand-picked advisers," Lucas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Both bills now go to the Senate.</td></tr>

<h3>EU's Mogherini blames Islamic State for Tunisia attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The EU corrected an earlier statement, removing a reference to Daesh, the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.</td></tr>
