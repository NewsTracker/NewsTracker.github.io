<h3>Germanwings crash: clue from cockpit recorder</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One of the black box flight recorders from the Germanwings flight 9525 that crashed in the French Alps on Tuesday killing all 150 people aboard has been recovered at the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Seyne-les-Alpes: A single audio file found in the battered remains of a cockpit voice recorder may hold the first clues as to why Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 crashed into the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Overnight, Australian time, the French crash investigation body BEA announced its first breakthrough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A rescue worker searches near a piece of fuselage among the debris at the crash site of an Airbus A320, near Seyne-les-Alpes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The recording was extracted from the mangled and broken remnants of the recorder, a bright orange box found on Tuesday amid the debris scattered down a steep, dark ravine near Seyne-les-Alpes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One hundred and fifty people died in the crash, including a mother and son from Victoria, and a group of schoolchildren from Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Remi Jouty, head of BEA, said there were "some problems" reading the data on the cockpit recorder, which holds audio from four microphones and captures conversations and ambient noise during the flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>French firefighters tie a black ribbon to a Spanish flag outside a tent where relatives and officials are due to pay tribute to the victims of the Airbus A320 crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Nevertheless it was good news and a relief for us that we were able to extract an audio file that we can use," he said at a press conference in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Jouty did not say what, or who was audible on the recording.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It could be days before they can identify the voices heard in the recording, and a full analysis could take months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The high speed of the plane's collision with the mountainside had caused it to disintegrate into small pieces, causing the damage to the flight recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, French President Francois Hollande, centre, and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy pay their respects near the mountain where a Germanwings jetliner crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Jouty said the debris field left by the crash was relatively small, suggesting the plane had not exploded in mid-air, but disintegrated on impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However it was too early to tell whether, as some have speculated, the crash was caused by a sudden loss of air pressure in the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said the curve of the plane's descent suggested some element of control, though it was more likely an automated system than human.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The curve is compatible with an aircraft controlled by pilots, except for the fact that we can't imagine pilots sending an aircraft into a mountain, but it may also be compatible with an autopilot," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said the final communication from the plane was a routine message about permission to continue on its route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A rescue worker climbs past debris at the site of the plane crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>According to some reports, parts of the plane's second data recorder have been recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It was said to be even more damaged than the first, and no data has yet been successfully recovered from it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The New York Times reported that a memory chip had been thrown from the box on impact and had not yet been found on the mountainside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>All Wednesday, rescue and investigation teams flew in and out of the picturesque village of Seyne-les-Alpes, about 10km from the crash site, where the emergency effort has its headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Helicopters surveyed the debris from the air, and emergency crews hiked over the rocky terrain - more than 600 rescue workers and aviation investigators were in the area, French officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mourners at a makeshift memorial at the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school: 16 students and two teachers from the school were on Germanwings flight 4U9525 that crashed on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The priority is to recover the victims' bodies - and to protect them from the elements before they are recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>There are signs of Spring in the air, and though the highest peaks are still snow-capped, the ice is melting and it rains more often than it snows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Gendarmes have cordoned off many of the tracks into the region around the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Members of the BEA, the French Air Accident Investigation Agency, in Seyne-les-Alpes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Seyne usually makes its money from tourism - but the locals rushed to help the emergency workers, advising on the best way over the mountain to the crash site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>More than 200 locals offered their homes to house the families of the victims, and a team of psychologists, carers and local teachers acting as interpreters have assembled to help them when they arrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>French president Francois Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel flew by helicopter over the crash site on Wednesday before landing in Seyne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Night falls on the Alps near the site where a Germanwings flight crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>They were joined by Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy at the small village of Le Vernet, in the shadow of the mountain range where the plane crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A small room next to a restaurant has been converted into a community chapel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Inside a makeshift memorial flame burns, and a simple bouquet of flowers sits by a condolence book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Outside, Spanish, French and German flags stand as a mark of respect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It is expected that family members will visit the chapel, as a place to pray for their loved ones - and perhaps the closest they will be able to get to the actual site they lost their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Afterwards, at a press conference in Seyne, Ms Merkel said the leaders were "very much united and connected".</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>She said relatives and friends of the victims would be very welcome there if they wished to come to where the tragedy happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Mr Rajoy said the leaders were "together with you in your pain".</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"The worst that could happen to a human being has happened," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Mr Hollande praised the rescue workers for securing the site and protecting the bodies of the dead "in a difficult area", as well as protecting parts of the destroyed aircraft to preserve them for the crash investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"In times of trial, and we've had a few here in recent months, there's also solidarity," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"Human solidarity is among us. And I'm proud that France can give this image in this moment of pain."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>More names have emerged of those lost in the crash, though the airline has not yet released a definite list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>They include Australians Greig Friday, 29, and Carol Friday, 68 a mother and son from Victoria, 16 students and two teachers from a school in Haltern, Germany, and others from the UK, the US, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, the Netherlands, Mexico, Japan, Denmark, Israel and Iran.</td></tr>
