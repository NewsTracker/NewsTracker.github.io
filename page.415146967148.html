<h3>Indonesia says legal appeals irrelevant as Bali nine transfer date to be decided Tuesday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bali's chief prosectuor, Momock Bambang Samiarso, revealed the information after leaving Kerobokan prison late on Monday, where he met with prison governor Sudjonggo, Australian consul-general Majell Hind and lawyer for the pair Julian McMahon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"[The date] will be decided tomorrow at the co-ordination meeting," Mr Momock said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The comments come as HM Prasetyo, Indonesia's Attorney-General, said that numerous legal appeals would not affect the timing of the execution and were irrelevant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers plan to lodge an appeal in the next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They are appealing the refusal of Indonesian President Joko Widodo to grant clemency to the Australian drug smugglers, saying he did not consider their case properly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Several others slated to be executed also have legal appeals in the works, including one case involving a Philippine woman, Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, which is due to be heard on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The [clemency] request was rejected so it is the final decision. Actually, after clemency there is no more legal avenues left," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Counsel for the Australians, Julian McMahon, said Mr Prasetyo's stance would bring international condemnation upon Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was important that his clients' case was tested on its merits and the rule of law was respected in Indonesia, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said that preparations were "95 per cent" complete for the simultaneous killing by firing squad of the Bali nine duo and eight other drug felons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>All up, nine of those to be killed are foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Regarding the transfer [of Chan and Sukumaran from Bali], it will be done as soon as possible," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's all related to technical issues. Maybe there are still some things that need to be prepared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier, the Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso said a transfer this week to the execution island of Nusakambangan was "definite".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Meanwhile, Minister for Justice Yasonna Laoly, whose ministry oversees the Attorney-General, told the ABC that the executions "should be no later than mid-March".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A transfer later in the week, or early next week, seems most likely as officials and others involved in the execution are scheduled to visit Cilacap, the port town near Nusakambangan on Wednesday for a co-ordination meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hendra Eka Putra, the head of Pasir Putih prison on Nusakambangan, said the meeting would include police, grave diggers, the coffin maker, spiritual leaders, prison authorities and local government officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It would be held on Wednesday in the seaport town of Cilacap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Information from that meeting would be conveyed to the Attorney-General's office, which would then send officials to visit the Nusakambangan prison compound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"So in my opinion it still takes sometime for the execution to take place," Mr Hendra said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meanwhile, in the wake of Mr Joko's confidante - Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama - urging him to reconsider the death penalty, other prominent Indonesians have spoken out against capital punishment and the morbid spectacle of the killing of Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Jakarta Post senior editor Endy Bayuni warned Mr Joko he would make the "biggest mistake" of his presidency by putting the two reformed drug syndicate organisers before a firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A referendum was needed on the issue, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"But by calling for a referendum on capital punishment, preceded by a national debate, this would give the perfect pretext for the government to stop all executions for now," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Meanwhile, Indonesia's former foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda called on the Indonesian government to tone down its seemingly gleeful rhetoric about plans for executing foreign nationals on death row, the Jakarta Globe reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"[It is] as if we enjoy killing people," Mr Hassan said at the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But Mr Joko has shown no sign of changing his hardline stance on the executions, saying the executions are needed to stop a "drugs crisis" and are a matter of Indonesian sovereignty.</td></tr>

<h3>Russia: floral tributes pile up at Nemstov murder scene</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I'll remember him as a brave man, honest and with strong principles," said Dmitry Denisov who travelled from outside of the capital to lay flowers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have very few of those left in our country now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It is possible (that Nemtsov was killed) because of his business," said local resident Yelena Malyutina, who continued, "or because he had this young girlfriend who had another admirer, because of some jealousy or something. I do not think it (his murder) was political, he wasn't in the way of anybody in politics."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The killing came two days before Nemtsov was due to lead a big rally through the centre of Moscow against the war in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That rally transformed into a memorial march, which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets of the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Russian president Vladimir Putin has vowed to pursue Nemtsov's killers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Investigators are following several lines of inquiry including the possibility that Nemtsov, who was Jewish, was killed by radical Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nemtsov's funeral is planned for Tuesday.</td></tr>
