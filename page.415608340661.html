<h3>Lawyers: Millionaire Robert Durst illegally arrested</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, William Gibbens and Dick DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They say he should be released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated "to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama 'The Jinx.'" The six-part documentary concluded Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was charged with murder in California for the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings - that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge.</td></tr>
