<tr><td>7</td><td>"We have contacted technicians to see if we can sedate the rhino. Our focus is to rescue it," Sharma said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Authorities have also called in trained elephants to try to corner the rhino and guide it back to the Parsa Wildlife Reserve, located around 60 kilometres south-west of the capital Kathmandu.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>Nepal, home to 534 rhinos, has twice been recognised by conservation experts for going a full year with no poaching incidents involving tigers or rhinos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thousands of one-horned rhinos once roamed the plains of Nepal, but their numbers have plunged over the past century due to poaching and human encroachment of their habitat.</td></tr>
