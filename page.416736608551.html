<h3>Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry wins NBA MVP (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OAKLAND, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry won the NBA's Most Valuable Player award Monday, beating out Houston's James Harden in a race that turned out not to be that close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Curry received 100 of 130 first-place votes for a total of 1,198 points from a panel of 129 writers and broadcasters, along with the fan vote on the NBA's website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Harden had 25 first-place votes and 936 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cleveland's LeBron James, a four-time MVP, got five first-place votes and 552 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Curry carried the top-seeded Warriors to a franchise-record 67 wins, surpassed his own record for most 3-pointers in a season and added to his growing reputation as one of the most entertaining spectacles in sports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He's the franchise's first MVP since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960, when the Warriors played in Philadelphia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Curry was set to receive the award during an afternoon news conference Monday in Oakland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He will be presented with the hardware again during an on-court ceremony when Golden State hosts Memphis in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinal series Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Curry, who had 22 points and seven assists in the Warriors' 101-86 victory over the Grizzlies on Sunday, has overcome obstacles at every level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He grew up in the shadow of his father, former NBA player Dell Curry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Most major colleges didn't offer him a scholarship coming out of high school in Charlotte, North Carolina, believing he was too small.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And some professional scouts wondered whether his game could transition to the NBA, where point guards are bigger and defenses are tougher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Instead, Curry has gone from a shooting guard who dazzled at Davidson during the NCAA Tournament to a polished professional point guard who can shoot, dribble and distribute with the best of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In a game dominated by big men and played by some of the world's greatest athletes, the 6-foot-3, 190-pound Curry controls the flow without physically overpowering defenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But there were times when it seemed Curry's potential might not be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two operations on his right ankle in his first three seasons with Golden State fueled questions about his durability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He even had to prove his worth to the team that drafted him seventh overall in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Curry signed a $44 million, four-year contract extension with the Warriors before the 2012-13 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Back then, the deal looked like a major risk for the Warriors considering Curry's injury history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Now?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Well, Curry is clearly one of basketball's best bargains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Curry eclipsed his own record of 272 3-pointers set two years ago, hitting 286 from beyond the arc this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He already owns three of the five most prolific 3-point shooting seasons in NBA history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Curry averaged 23.8 points, 7.7 assists, 4.3 rebounds and two steals this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He shot 48.7 percent from the floor and 44.3 percent from 3-point range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Off the floor, his popularity is also soaring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Curry received more All-Star votes than any player and joined James and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver at the league's biggest marketing events during All-Star weekend in New York, where his face plastered posters in subway stations and televisions in taxi cabs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He also delivered by winning his first 3-point contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>With the revitalized Warriors winning at a historic pace, Curry's case for MVP echoed around the league as loud as the nightly chants at rowdy Oracle Arena.</td></tr>
