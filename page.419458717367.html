<h3>FIFA Give Little Away After Secretive Sponsors' Meeting</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ZURICH - FIFA discussed reforms with some of its leading commercial partners on Thursday during a secretive meeting at the headquarters of world soccer's scandal-plagued governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA told its partners it was committed to reform and transparency but would not comment further on the meeting which it described as "internal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"During the meeting, FIFA reaffirmed its commitment to transparency, reform, and collaboration with its valued partners," said a statement.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>The sponsors said in a joint statement: "FIFA provided the sponsors with updates on several topics. During this meeting, we reiterated our expectations for robust reform, and we will continue to engage with FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A security guard was placed on the entrance to FIFA's headquarters, situated at the edge of an affluent hillside suburb, to prevent anyone from entering the grounds without an appointment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On most days, visitors can walk straight into the building and go to reception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said last month that the sponsors had written asking for information about what was being done to clean up governance of the sport and offering to meet soccer's ruling body.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>McDonald's said it had told FIFA that its internal controls and compliance culture were not consistent with the expectations it had for its business partners.</td></tr>
