<h3>LeBron gets triple-double, Cavs win 18th straight at home (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>J.R. Smith made eight 3s, Kyrie Irving casually dropped one from 52 feet and scored 27 as the Cavs moved closer to a Central Division title and securing the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>2 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mike Dunleavy scored 24 and Aaron Brooks 17 for the Bulls, who could have star guard Derrick Rose back in the next few days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>James finished with 20 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds, his first triple-double in a Cleveland uniform since May 13, 2010, two months before he left as a free agent for Miami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Cavs notched win No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>50 and improved to a league-best 31-7 since Jan. 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Smith scored all 24 points from long range as the Cavs improved to 3-1 this season against the Bulls, a team they could face in the postseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By then, Rose may be back following knee surgery, which would spice up a series that doesn't need any hype.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>James' teams have eliminated the Bulls three times in the past five seasons and the four-time MVP has a running feud with Bulls center Joakim Noah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The two exchanged words Sunday and could soon see each other with more on the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Cavs were up by 10 in the third when Irving hit his improbable 3 from well beyond half-court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After catching the inbounds pass, Irving realized there were less than 2 seconds left on the 24-second shot clock and launched his shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>After it swished through the hoop, Irving raised his hands as if to say "no big deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Still, the Bulls were within striking distance late before Kevin Love's 3 with 1:14 left gave the Cavs a 96-87 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Smith drained an off-balance, 3-pointer from 40 feet just before the halftime horn, giving the Cavaliers a 54-45 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After hitting his sixth 3 of the opening half, Smith fell into one of the expensive courtside seats to admire his work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Irving, too, made a 3 from the corner at the conclusion of the first quarter for Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Bulls were without their starting backcourt as Kirk Hinrich (hyperextended knee) joined Rose on the sideline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Rose did on-court drills before the game and is nearing a return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He was recently cleared for full-contact workouts as he returns from surgery on his right knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau hopes Rose, who had surgery on Feb. 27, will return this week, when the Bulls play at Orlando on Wednesday and Miami on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Ideally, the sooner the better, but he has to be comfortable enough to play," Thibodeau said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We're not going to play him the amount of minutes he was playing before he got injured. We've got to re-establish his baseline, something where he can get his feet wet and start moving forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Bulls: Because of injuries, Chicago has had its starting lineup - Rose, Dunleavy, Noah, Jimmy Butler and Pau Gasol - just 19 times this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Bulls are 15-4 in those games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>... Thibodeau said Rose's presence alone makes the Bulls better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Just Derrick on the floor helps our team," Thibodeau said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We don't expect him to be playing 35 minutes a night or scoring a ton of points. Just give us what you have."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Cavaliers: James, who added three steals and a block, was stripped of a triple-double earlier this season against New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The NBA took away an assist after reviewing the Nov. 10 game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>... During the home winning streak, all five Cavs starters have averaged double figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>... According to information provided by the Cavs, the team came in leading the NBA in alley-oop dunks with 74 since Mozgov arrived on Jan. 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Clippers were second with 47.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Bulls: At Orlando on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Cavaliers: At Milwaukee on Wednesday.</td></tr>
