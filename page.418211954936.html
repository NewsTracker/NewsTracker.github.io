<h3>Draft report of MH17 crash handed over</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Dutch Safety Board has handed a draft report on the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine to the countries involved in the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The report was handed to representatives of Australia, Malaysia, Ukraine, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands on June 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The countries have 60 days, till August 1, to make their comments with the final report expected in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No details of the confidential draft were released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Comment has been sought from the Australian government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Flight MH17, from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was downed on July 17, 2015 killing all 298 people on board, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Dutch Safety Board said last year that the Boeing 777 was likely brought down by "multiple high-energy objects", a finding experts said likely indicated a missile strike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is believed the draft addresses the cause of the crash as well as whether the plane should have been assigned that flight path, and whether the process of releasing passenger information could have been better handled, Malaysian portal The Star Online reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Belgium and the UK have proposed a UN tribunal to try those responsible for downing the plane, but Russia last week dismissed the idea as not timely and counterproductive.</td></tr>
