<h3>Clinton tells camp counselors the nation's political leaders could use 'camps for adults'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton offered a bipartisan, feel-good message Thursday during a paid speech to camp counselors in the weeks before her expected presidential campaign launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She was presented with a gray sweatshirt emblazoned with "Camp David" - the presidential retreat in Maryland - but otherwise steered clear of her prospective campaign, pointing to a "huge fun deficit" in the nation and the need for politicians of all stripes to reach across the aisle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We really need camps for adults," Clinton said at the American Camp Association, New York and New Jersey's Tri State CAMP Conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Maybe mix it up a little bit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Playing on the colors of U.S. politics, she imagined a red cabin and a blue cabin where people "have to come together and actually listen to each other. Wouldn't that be a novel idea?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton answered friendly questions on stage in a session moderated by Jay Jacobs, a New York summer camp executive who supported Clinton's New York Senate bid and serves as chairman of the Nassau County, N.Y., Democratic Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The former secretary of state did not address recent criticism of her use of a personal email account at the State Department and was not asked about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Preparing for a campaign, Clinton has often spoken of the need for congressional leaders to work together even while she criticizes some of their actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She has taken to Twitter in recent days to register disapproval with a GOP budget proposal, efforts by Republicans to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law and the stalled nomination of Loretta Lynch for attorney general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said Clinton's "lip service to bipartisanship" masked a partisan record in the Senate and support for Obama's "divisive, left-wing agenda."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was probably Clinton's final paid speech before the start of her presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She has two public events on her schedule next week but nothing scheduled in April, when she is expected to announce her bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since departing the State Department in early 2013, Clinton has appeared at a number of corporate events, universities and conventions, often receiving fees of $200,000 or more, potentially opening her up to attacks of being beholden to corporate interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>During her appearance, Clinton offered plenty of camp stories, recalling daughter Chelsea Clinton's insistence at attending a sleep-away camp as a child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When she and former President Bill Clinton let Chelsea go to a language camp to study German for a week, it was tough as a parent, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It was the worst week - well, I've had a few bad weeks," Clinton said to laughter in a nod to the scrutiny she's faced in public life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"But it was up there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Asked about her resilience, she talked about her mother's difficult upbringing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Whenever I get a little bit, you know, feeling kind of sorry for myself, thinking 'That's not fair, that's not right,' I say to myself, 'Yeah, right and look at what my mother went through,'" Clinton said.</td></tr>
