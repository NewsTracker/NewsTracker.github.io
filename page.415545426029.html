<h3>German police clash with protesters at anti-austerity protest</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FRANKFURT, Germany -- At least four police cars were set alight and two officers injured Wednesday as authorities confronted violent anti-austerity protesters ahead of the inauguration ceremony for the European Central Bank's new headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ceremony went ahead as planned, with ECB President Mario Draghi saying the new building for the euro bloc's monetary authority was "a symbol of what Europe can achieve together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police said 350 people were detained as officers pursued what they said was a minority of violence-minded activists using the protest as cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The bulk of demonstrators conducted themselves peacefully, marching in groups, drumming and singing ahead of a rally in the city's main square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some blocked bridges across the Main River or streets in an effort to hinder access to the ECB ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Protesters said they are targeting the central bank because of its role in supervising efforts to restrain spending and reduce debt in financially troubled countries such as Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Blockupy activist Hannah Eberle said that "people remain determined" despite the heavy police presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The mood is good, we are in solidarity with each other," she said ahead of the rally: "The day is long, we are not yet finished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At the ECB ceremony, Tarek Al-Wazir, economy minister of the German Hesse region, called on the peaceful demonstrators to "distance yourselves from the violence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wazir, a member of the Greens party, said that the protesters "have no answers... but they have some of the right questions," conceding that "austerity can indeed be self-defeating."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said the ECB was the wrong target for this kind of protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Draghi has in fact urged more spending by governments that are in good financial shape such as Germany to help lift the economy and reduce unemployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That advice has been ignored by the German government, which has stressed the need to balance its budget and pressed others to restrain spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Police said several police cars were set on fire at a police station in the city centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Another police vehicle smouldered a block from the ECB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Private vehicles and garbage bins were also torched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some 10,000 people were expected on Frankfurt's main square, the Roemerberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Participants were to include trade unions and Germany's Left Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The ECB, along with the European Commission and International Monetary Fund, is part of the so-called "troika" that monitors compliance with the conditions of bailout loans for Greece and other financially troubled countries in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Those conditions include spending cuts and reducing deficits, moves that are aimed at reducing debt but have also been blamed for high unemployment and slow growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Anti-austerity activists received a political boost when Greece's left-wing Syriza party won elections there in January by campaigning against the bailout deal and its conditions, which they say has led to a "humanitarian crisis."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A demonstrator walks past a burning police car after clashes between demonstrators and police in Frankfurt, Germany on Wednesday, March 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Masked demonstrators run past a burning police car after clashes between demonstrators and police in Frankfurt, Germany on Wednesday, March 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Demonstrators dressed as clowns pass by a burning police car in Frankfurt, Germany on Wednesday, March 18, 2015.</td></tr>

<h3>Crimea exiles fight to keep Ukraine unity message alive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For 11 days, Andrei Schekun said, they beat him, shocked him with electrodes and scalded him with burning metallic plates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the torture took place as Crimea voted in a referendum to secede from Ukraine a year ago Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Schekun's crime: campaigning to persuade his fellow Crimeans to reject absorption by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Schekun's crusade for Ukrainian unity, which he continues today in exile, began as pro-Moscow sentiment among the majority ethnic Russian population reached fever pitch on the peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Demands for a split from Ukraine spiked within days of the February ouster of Moscow-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although most Ukrainians resented the president with feverish intensity for his predatory rule, people in regions such as Crimea and eastern Ukraine, with dominant ethnic Russian populations, viewed him with more sympathy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russian state television stations already fed them a steady diet of stories about unrest being led by rabid Ukrainian nationalists bent on oppression of the Russian population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ill-intentioned Ukrainians, the Russian networks warned, were poised to descend upon Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Schekun's activism in drumming up support in Crimea for the anti-government protests that toppled Yanukovych was enough to make him suspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Soon flyers appeared in the courtyard outside Schekun's home in the Crimean town of Bakhchysarai describing him as a traitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Everywhere in the district where we lived, they stuck up leaflets with his face, calling him a bloodthirsty traitor and a fascist, and all kinds of other things," said Schekun's wife, Lyudmila, speaking from their new home outside Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Schekun, along with his wife and three sons, are among the roughly 20,000 people who Ukrainian officials say have left Crimea for the mainland since the region was annexed by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On March 9, one week before the referendum, plain-clothed policemen detained Schekun at a train station in the Crimean capital of Simferopol, as he awaited the delivery of Ukrainian flags and symbols.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The group was from a self-described militia charged with ensuring the referendum on joining Russia proceeded smoothly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They thought we wanted to derail their referendum," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They thought we were some kind of terrorist group or something."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Pro-Ukrainian activism inside Crimea has become an even more dangerous proposition since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Last week, a small group of Crimea residents marked the day of Ukraine's national poet Taras Shevchenko by gathering outside his statue in Simferopol with Ukrainian flags.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That minor act of defiance earned them 40 hours hard labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The peninsula's Tatar minority, whose leadership resisted Russian annexation, says it too has been subjected to intimidation that has ranged from petty official harassment to beatings, kidnappings and murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Speaking at a United Nations conference in Geneva on Monday, the human rights envoy for Ukraine's parliament, Valeriya Lutkovskaya, described Crimea as a "peninsula of terror."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"People are afraid to express their opinion," Lutkovskaya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"They feel fear for their life and future, fear to espouse their faith and speak in their native language."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>According to the most recent census, carried out in 2001, ethnic Ukrainians make up one-quarter of Crimea's population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>From a distance, exiles feel at a loss to help and say they are disappointed with the Ukrainian government's failure to keep Crimea near the top of its agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Unfortunately, there is at the moment no single government executive body that deals with Crimean matters," said Eskender Bariyev, a member of the Mejlis, a self-governing body of Crimean Tatars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>With government initiative lacking, Schekun says it is up to activists like him to shore up the morale of Ukrainians still in Crimea: "They need our moral support," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"They need to hear us say 'We haven't betrayed you, we haven't abandoned you. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It's hard to keep up the fight in a rented apartment outside the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But Schekun remains upbeat about his mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We will not let the government forget," Schekun said, joined by his wife in emphatically finishing the thought, "that Crimea is Ukraine."</td></tr>
