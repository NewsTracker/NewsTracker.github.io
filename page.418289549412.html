<tr><td>24</td><td>ATHENS Greeks voted on Sunday whether to accept or reject the tough terms of an aid offer to stave off financial collapse, in a referendum that may determine their future in Europe's common currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Held against a backdrop of default, shuttered banks and threats of financial apocalypse, the vote was too close to call and looked certain to herald yet more turbulence whichever way it went.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The country of 11 million people is deeply divided over whether to accept an offer by international creditors that left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, elected in January on a promise to end years of crippling austerity, calls a "humiliation".</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He is urging a resounding 'No', saying it would give him a strengthened mandate to return to negotiations and demand a better deal, including a writedown on Greece's massive debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>His European partners, however, say rejection would set Greece on a path out of the euro, with potentially far-reaching consequences for the global economy and Europe's grand project of an unbreakable union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"I voted 'No' to the 'Yes' that our European partners insist I choose," said Eleni Deligainni, 43, in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I have been jobless for nearly four years and was telling myself to be patient ... but we've had enough deprivation and unemployment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Voting on whether to accept more taxes and pension cuts would be divisive in any nation at the best of times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In Greece, the choice is faced by an angry and exhausted population who, after five years of pension cuts, falling salaries and rising taxes, have now suffered through a week of capital controls imposed to prevent the collapse of the nation's financial system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Pensioners besieging bank gates to claim their retirement benefits, only to leave empty-handed and in tears, have become a symbol of the nation's dramatic fall over the past decade, from the heady days of the 2004 Athens Olympics to the ignominy of bankruptcy and bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Tsipras, a 40-year-old former student activist, has framed the referendum as a matter of national dignity and the future course of Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"As of tomorrow we will have opened a new road for all the peoples of Europe," he said after voting in Athens, "a road that leads back to the founding values of democracy and solidarity in Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>A 'No' vote, he said, "will send a message of determination, not only to stay in Europe but to live with dignity in Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"You call this dignity, to stand in line at teller machines for a few euros?" asked pensioner Yannis Kontis, 76, after voting in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"I voted 'Yes' so we can stay with Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Four opinion polls published on Friday showed the 'Yes' vote marginally ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A fifth put the 'No' camp 0.5 percentage points in front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>All were well within the margin of error.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Called at eight days' notice, the referendum offers Greece a 'Yes' or 'No' vote on a proposal that is no longer on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Given the chaos of the past week, in which Greece became the first developed economy to default on a loan to the International Monetary Fund, a new bailout package would probably entail harsher terms than those on offer even last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Anxious Greeks rallying for a 'Yes' vote also say Greece has been handed a raw deal but that the alternative, a collapse of the banks and a return of the old drachma currency, would be far worse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The 'No' camp says Greece cannot afford more of the austerity that has left one in four without a job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>If Greeks vote 'Yes' to the bailout, the government has indicated it will resign -- triggering a new chapter of uncertainty as political parties try to cobble together a national unity government to keep talks with lenders going until elections are held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>European creditors have said a 'Yes' vote will resurrect hopes of aid to Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>A 'No', they say, will represent rejection of the rules that bind the euro zone nations, leaving Greece to fend for itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"If they (Greeks) say 'No', they will have to introduce another currency after the referendum because the euro is not available as a means of payment," Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, said in remarks broadcast on Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"And how are they going to pay salaries? How are they going to pay pensions? As soon as someone introduces a new currency, they exit the euro zone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Much will depend on the European Central Bank, which on Monday morning will review its emergency liquidity line to Greek banks, keeping them afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The ECB could decide to freeze the liquidity or cut it off altogether if Greeks vote 'No', or if Athens subsequently defaults on a bond redemption to the ECB on July 20.</td></tr>
