<h3>Mexico decries new Texas law beefing up security on border</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - The Mexican government says it regrets Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to sign into law an $800 million border security package that will mean more state troopers, cameras and a spy plane to patrol the U.S. state's 1,200-mile border with Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said Wednesday the new law will "promote division between our societies, and runs contrary to the principles and values governing the U.S.-Mexico bilateral relationship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Abbott signed the measure Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It should accelerate the hiring of 250 additional state troopers who will patrol the border, replacing National Guard troops deployed there last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mexico didn't appear to object to moves to replace the National Guard troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It has long opposed any militarization of the border.</td></tr>
