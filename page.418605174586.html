<h3>Prosecutor: Banned FIFA official in US to face charges</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A top former FIFA official has arrived in the United States to face racketeering and bribery charges in a sweeping corruption case that sent shock waves throughout the soccer world, a U.S. prosecutor confirmed Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, a judge asked the government about the status of Jeffrey Webb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Assistant U.S. Attorney Evan Norris confirmed reports Webb had been extradicted from Switzerland but added that no court date has been set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The 50-year-old Webb was among seven FIFA officials detained in Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The rest are fighting extradition, Norris said, adding that it could take several months before they appear in a U.S. court if they exhaust all appeal options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Since the indictment, Webb was banned provisionally and replaced as the FIFA vice president from the North and Central American and Caribbean region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>From the Cayman Islands, Webb also was president of the regional governing body CONCACAF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There was no immediate response to messages left Friday with Webb's lawyer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The courtroom exchange came at a hearing for another defendant, Aaron Davidson, president of the marketing company Traffic Sports USA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie granted a postponement of the Davidson's case after lawyers notified him that they were involved in plea negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A total of 14 men - nine soccer officials and five marketing executives - were indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in May, including former FIFA vice president Jack Warner, who is resisting extradition from Trinidad and Tobago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prosecutors allege the defendants plotted to pay bribes of more than $150 million over a 24-year period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The payments were tied to the award of broadcasting and hosting rights for the World Cup, continental championships in North and South America, and regional club tournaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Webb promised reform when he was elected in 2012 to succeed Warner as president of CONCACAF.</td></tr>
