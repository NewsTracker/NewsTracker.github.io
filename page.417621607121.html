<h3>Apple TV is a non-event at WWDC</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Don't think for a second that Apple CEO Tim Cook's failure to announce any meaningful update to his company's television business means Apple is losing interest in the living room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple TV is a non-event at WWDC Don't think for a second that Apple CEO Tim Cook's failure to announce any meaningful update to his company's television business means Apple is losing interest in the living room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO--Don't think for a second that Apple CEO Tim Cook's failure to utter a peep about his company's plans for the television business-no streaming TV service, no new Apple TV hardware update-means Apple is any less enthusiastic about eventually taking on dominant role in your living room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Or for that matter serving up TV fare when you're out and about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cook may have left those things out for now in a World Wide Developer Conference keynote dominated by news of a fresh streaming music service with called Apple Music, a developer kit for the Apple Watch, and of course, updates to both Mac OS X (new name El Capitan) and iOS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>All it likely suggests is that a revamped Apple TV box and streaming TV are on the back burner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rumors surrounding Apple's ambitions in TV go back years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Leading up to WWDC, there had been rampant speculation that the Apple TV box that hasn't seen a major update in three years-aside from a March price reduction from $99 to $69--might get a new touch-based remote control, new apps, and voice support for Siri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>By the time Cook took the stage, those hopes were dashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There was equal conjecture that Apple is hard at work on a streaming TV service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>I fully believe that to be the case but rights negotiations are hard and Apple and its presumed content partners apparently haven't progressed far enough for any news to break at WWDC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Of course, Apple did strike what is for now an exclusive deal with Showtime last week to stream premium content from the CBS-owned property onto Apple TV and other Apple devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It kicks off in July at a monthly cost of $10.99.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That deal came on the heels of a similar arrangement with HBO last March on its $14.99 a month HBO Now service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But updates for Apple TV hardware, the box Steve Jobs famously referred to as a "hobby," must wait another day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>You would think Apple is pretty far along with updates to the box, but the company may want to time an announcement of new hardware with the introduction of a streaming TV service, if or more likely when that finally happens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It's not that Apple TV is an inferior product and at $69 it's a pretty good buy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Besides Showtime and HBO, you can use it to stream YouTube, and if you subscribe, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and several other channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>You can also use it to stream movies you buy or rent, and to play back content that resides somewhere else in your house on a Mac or iPhone, including photos and music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Still, avid TV fans crave something more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Apple's rivals in the space have been aggressive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Roku recently added voice search to some of its devices, a feature Amazon already boasts on its Fire TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Roku boasts more than 2000 channels, and its service is now built into TVs from Sharp, TCL, Hisense and Insignia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>For its part, Amazon has added more than 600 channels, apps and games to Fire TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That's about the same number of channels Google offers for its Android TV platform that's showcased on its $79 Nexus Player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Meanwhile, Google's popular $35 Chromecast dongle also keeps gaining fresh content-HBO Now for one will be added to Chromecast this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And don't discount the competition Apple faces from such living room consoles, including Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's Playstation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It's a good bet Apple will further expand into TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The cliffhanger is trying to figure out when it will happen.</td></tr>
