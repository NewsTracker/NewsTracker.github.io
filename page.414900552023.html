<h3>Russia is sending more tanks and troops into Ukraine to take the next battlefront, Kiev says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Only about 1000 of the town's pre-war population of 27,000 remained, most of them elderly people too infirm or too stubborn to leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Out for the first time after a week of shelling and street fighting, they moved about in groups, with blackened faces and gritty clothes, busily scavenging for food in the ruins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The last week was just horrible," said Vasily Yegelsky, 77, a retiree who was limping along in the morning sunshine, headed to the outskirts of town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Out there, where Ukrainian soldiers were dug in for months before retreating in haste on Wednesday in the face of an assault by Russian-backed separatists, Mr Yegelsky and others wandered through abandoned trenches, looking for something to eat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bloody shreds of mattress hung from tree limbs, and stray dogs skulked nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But also strewn about were canned foods and much-prized bags of macaroni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As they picked through the detritus of war, they talked darkly of bodies lying uncollected in the streets through the fighting, of the sick and wounded stranded in basements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As yet there is no reliable estimate of the civilian casualties; European monitors with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe were not due to arrive until Saturday local time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But judging by the scenes of destruction, it is likely to add significantly to a wartime toll that the United Nations estimates at more than 5600 soldiers and civilians since combat began in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Debaltseve was under Ukrainian control when Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Francois Hollande of France brokered a ceasefire between Ukraine and the rebels in Minsk, Belarus, on February 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Friday, at a news conference in Paris, the beleaguered leaders insisted that the terms of the ceasefire be honoured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The ceasefire has been violated several times," Mr Hollande said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It must now be fully respected along the entire front line."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But according to Ukraine, it is serving purely as diplomatic cover while the rebels, and Russia, pursue their war aims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In recent days, despite the Minsk agreement, military equipment and ammunition have been sighted crossing from Russia into Ukraine," said the Ukrainian military's spokesman, Andriy Lysenko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said more than 20 Russian tanks, 10 missile systems and busloads of troops had crossed the frontier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Russia did not immediately respond to the accusation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Moscow has always denied accusations in the past that its forces are fighting in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kiev's biggest worry is that rebels will continue their advance to threaten Mariupol, a highly strategic port of 500,000 people that is the biggest city still under government control in the two rebellious eastern provinces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Novoazovsk, where Kiev said Russia was reinforcing, lies 40 kilometres to the east along the coast near the Russian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The United States, which is considering tightening sanctions against Russia and arming Kiev, also said it had sighted Russian reinforcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The US State Department said Russian support for the rebels was undermining international diplomacy and would bring "costs" on Moscow.</td></tr>
