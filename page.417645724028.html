<h3>Egypt court sentences TV broadcaster to 1 year for slander</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - A Cairo court has sentenced a TV broadcaster, known for his links to Egyptian security agencies and for being a supporter of the country's president, to one year in prison for insulting an Islamist politician.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tuesday's verdict is the third such sentence against Ahmed Moussa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The private TV Sada el-Balad's presenter is known for blistering attacks on Islamists and activists of the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In this case, he was convicted of insulting an Islamist politician and former presidential candidate in 2012, Abdel-Moneim Aboul-Fottouh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's unclear why Moussa - who was part of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's media entourage during a trip to Germany last week - was not imprisoned following an earlier verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A court last month upheld a two-year sentence against Moussa for slandering a liberal politician.</td></tr>
