<h3>Clashes At PMQs Ahead Of Pre-Election Budget</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The main party leaders have traded blows on the NHS ahead of the Chancellor's delivery of the 2015 Budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Labour leader Ed Miliband repeatedly accused the Prime Minister of breaking a string of key promises on the health service, warning it "cannot survive another five years of this government".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"When he makes a whole series of new NHS promises, why on earth should anyone believe him?", Mr Miliband asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>David Cameron hit back, saying it is the Conservatives who have the "strong economy which can deliver a strong NHS".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said: "We promised more money for our NHS, promise delivered. We promised more nurses for our NHS, promise delivered. We promised more doctors for our NHS, promise delivered."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Miliband accused Mr Cameron of going back on his pledge not carry out a top-down reorganisation of the NHS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We made two big decisions. Big decision number one was to put more money in, big decision number two was to take the bureaucracy out," the Prime Minister replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"That is why we have 9,500 more doctors and 7,500 more nurses."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In reply to allegations that he had failed to deliver on his pledge to cut A&E waiting times, Mr Cameron said that this year 93.7% of people have been seen within the four-hour target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Labour leader also accused the Government of missing its 62-day cancer treatment target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Using the Labour leader's constituency in Doncaster as an example, David Cameron replied with a list of targets he claimed had been met on waiting times for cancer diagnosis and treatment.</td></tr>

<h3>US chides Netanyahu?s party after Israeli election win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A spokesman said President Barack Obama still believes in Palestinian statehood - even if Netanyahu no longer does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In its first public response to Netanyahu's triumph in the election, the spokesman said the White House was "deeply concerned" about divisive language emanating from Netanyahu's Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the party had sought to marginalize Israel's minority Arabs, an apparent reference to social media posts the Likud distributed that warned Israelis about the danger of high turnout by Arab voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"These are views the administration intends to convey directly to the Israelis," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And while Earnest said Obama would be calling Netanyahu to congratulate him on his victory, he acknowledged the U.S. would have to re-evaluate the best way to bring about a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - a cornerstone of U.S. Mideast policy for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a veer to the right just before the election, Netanyahu reversed his former position and said he now opposes the creation of a separate Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Based on those comments, the U.S. will evaluate our position going forward," Earnest told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One on a flight to Cleveland for an event focused on U.S. manufacturing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Netanyahu shortly after the election to congratulate him, Earnest said, and Obama was to do the same in the days ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Downplaying any suggestion the president was delaying that call, Earnest pointed out that after previous Israeli elections, Obama had waited until the Israeli president had formally tasked the leading candidate with forming a new government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Israel's largely ceremonial president is expected to take that step soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earnest said he didn't expect Netanyahu's victory to have a negative impact on nuclear negotiations the U.S. and world powers are conducting with Iran, noting that the Israeli leader's views on the issue are well known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Netanyahu railed against those talks earlier this month in a speech to Congress that was perceived as a rebuke to Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Netanyahu drew criticism as Israelis were voting Tuesday after a midday post on his Facebook page contended high Arab voter turnout was endangering his Likud Party's rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Arab voters are going to the polls in droves. Left-wing organizations are bringing them in buses," he said.</td></tr>
