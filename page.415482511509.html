<h3>20-Year-Old Man Charged in Shooting of 2 Ferguson Police Officers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a Sunday afternoon press conference, St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch and police chief Jon Belmar identified the suspect as 20-year-old Jeffrey Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault (among other things) and is being held on $300,000 bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Williams, who was on probation for receiving stolen property, was already wanted by the police for failing to show up to meetings with his probation officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mug shot: Williams was taken into custody without a struggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Possible he was firing at someone other than police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>McCulloch said that Williams confessed to the shooting, which took place during a demonstration celebrating the resignation of Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>McCulloch also said that a search had turned up a handgun that matched the spent cartridges found near Tiffin Avenue, which is where witnesses said the shooter appeared to have been located.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>(The shots came from a hill around 125 yards behind the crowd of protesters.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>McCulloch told reporters that Williams had been part of the demonstration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Williams apparently told investigators that he left at some point and returned with the gun, which he intended to use against a person with whom he had some kind of fight, as opposed to the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It is possible that he was firing at someone other than the police," said McCulloch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But, he added, "We're not completely buying that part of it ... We're not 100 percent sure there was a dispute."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Asked 4 protest regulars if they've ever seen/met Jeffrey Williams.</td></tr>
