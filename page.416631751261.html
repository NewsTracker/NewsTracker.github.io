<h3>Euro zone exits deflation - just</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS, April 30 (Reuters) - The euro zone ended four months of deflation in April with consumer prices unchanged from year-ago levels, removing the threat of persistent price declines as energy costs pushed up in the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Consumer prices in the 19 countries that share the euro were flat in April from a year earlier after a 0.1 percent decline in March, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bottoming out of price declines is likely to be welcome news for the European Central Bank, which wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It started printing money in March to inject more cash into the economy and ward off concerns of persistently falling prices, or deflation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Economists have said inflation should become positive in the second half of 2015 as energy becomes less of a drag given that oil prices started falling sharply from June last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Indeed some are already questioning whether the ECB will need to carry out quantitative easing all the way through to September 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ralph Solveen, economist at Commerzbank, said it was too early to say whether the ECB's quantitative easing (QE) was already having an impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Whether it's the positive things such as the better economic data we've had recently or low inflation. QE can't work that fast," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As in previous months, the weakness of prices was mainly driven by the declining cost of energy, which was 5.8 percent cheaper in April than a year earlier, although oil prices rose some 15 percent in euro terms during the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food costs, was unchanged at 0.6 percent year-on-year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>ING euro zone economist Teunis Brosens said the lack of a deflationary trend there was good news, but noted that services inflation fell to 0.9 percent, an all-time low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It means we can't close the book on deflationary pressures right yet," he said, adding it was sufficient cause for the ECB to err on the side of caution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Eurostat's flash estimate for the month does not include a monthly calculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In another slightly positive sign for the euro zone economy, Eurostat said euro zone unemployment fell marginally in March by 36,000 to 18.105 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, this was not enough to change the unemployment rate from the 11.3 percent of February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Economists had been expecting the rate to drop to a new three-year low of 11.2 percent.</td></tr>
