<h3>Denmark tells its citizens not to travel to Tunisia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ministry on Friday didn't elaborate but Danes traditionally follow Britain when it comes to travel advisories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A day earlier, Britain had urged its citizens to leave Tunisia, saying an extremist attack was "highly likely" despite Tunisia's enhanced security measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On June 26, a gunman killed 38 tourists, mostly Britons, in the coastal resort of Sousse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Following that, Danish tour operators immediately stopped flying to the popular destination for Europeans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Finland's Foreign Ministry also says Friday "there's a possibility of terror acts" in Tunisia but doesn't specifically tell travelers not to go.</td></tr>
