<h3>Rockets land in Israel, Egypt's IS affiliate claims responsibility</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM/CAIRO Militants in Egypt's Sinai peninsula fired rockets into southern Israel on Friday in an incident that caused no casualties but appeared to be linked to fighting between Islamist insurgents and Egyptian security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Islamic State's Egypt affiliate, Sinai Province, said in a statement posted on Twitter by supporters that it had launched three Grad rockets toward "occupied Palestine".</td></tr>
