<tr><td>40</td><td>People often times see me as talent which is fine but what I'm very good at is strategy and marketing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>AP: Have you become careful about what you say you like because it becomes an endorsement when you're a public figure?</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Phan: No, I'm very authentic with what I like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>I keep it real with what I'm using and where I'm buying it from.</td></tr>
