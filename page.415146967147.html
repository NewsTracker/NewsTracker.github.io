<h3>Indonesia says legal appeals irrelevant as Bali nine transfer date to be decided Tuesday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bali's chief prosectuor, Momock Bambang Samiarso, revealed the information after leaving Kerobokan prison late on Monday, where he met with prison governor Sudjonggo, Australian consul-general Majell Hind and lawyer for the pair Julian McMahon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"[The date] will be decided tomorrow at the co-ordination meeting," Mr Momock said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The comments come as HM Prasetyo, Indonesia's Attorney-General, said that numerous legal appeals would not affect the timing of the execution and were irrelevant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers plan to lodge an appeal in the next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They are appealing the refusal of Indonesian President Joko Widodo to grant clemency to the Australian drug smugglers, saying he did not consider their case properly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Several others slated to be executed also have legal appeals in the works, including one case involving a Philippine woman, Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, which is due to be heard on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The [clemency] request was rejected so it is the final decision. Actually, after clemency there is no more legal avenues left," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Counsel for the Australians, Julian McMahon, said Mr Prasetyo's stance would bring international condemnation upon Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was important that his clients' case was tested on its merits and the rule of law was respected in Indonesia, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said that preparations were "95 per cent" complete for the simultaneous killing by firing squad of the Bali nine duo and eight other drug felons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>All up, nine of those to be killed are foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Regarding the transfer [of Chan and Sukumaran from Bali], it will be done as soon as possible," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's all related to technical issues. Maybe there are still some things that need to be prepared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier, the Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso said a transfer this week to the execution island of Nusakambangan was "definite".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Meanwhile, Minister for Justice Yasonna Laoly, whose ministry oversees the Attorney-General, told the ABC that the executions "should be no later than mid-March".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A transfer later in the week, or early next week, seems most likely as officials and others involved in the execution are scheduled to visit Cilacap, the port town near Nusakambangan on Wednesday for a co-ordination meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hendra Eka Putra, the head of Pasir Putih prison on Nusakambangan, said the meeting would include police, grave diggers, the coffin maker, spiritual leaders, prison authorities and local government officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It would be held on Wednesday in the seaport town of Cilacap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Information from that meeting would be conveyed to the Attorney-General's office, which would then send officials to visit the Nusakambangan prison compound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"So in my opinion it still takes sometime for the execution to take place," Mr Hendra said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meanwhile, in the wake of Mr Joko's confidante - Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama - urging him to reconsider the death penalty, other prominent Indonesians have spoken out against capital punishment and the morbid spectacle of the killing of Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Jakarta Post senior editor Endy Bayuni warned Mr Joko he would make the "biggest mistake" of his presidency by putting the two reformed drug syndicate organisers before a firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A referendum was needed on the issue, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"But by calling for a referendum on capital punishment, preceded by a national debate, this would give the perfect pretext for the government to stop all executions for now," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Meanwhile, Indonesia's former foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda called on the Indonesian government to tone down its seemingly gleeful rhetoric about plans for executing foreign nationals on death row, the Jakarta Globe reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"[It is] as if we enjoy killing people," Mr Hassan said at the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But Mr Joko has shown no sign of changing his hardline stance on the executions, saying the executions are needed to stop a "drugs crisis" and are a matter of Indonesian sovereignty.</td></tr>

<h3>Ikea's new furniture can charge your phone - no wires necessary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Swedish furniture company opted to use the Qi standard in its new furniture, which includes lamps, tables and standalone charging pads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Qi is the most popular standard among handset manufacturers - the Nexus 6 and LG G3 both use it - but a competing standard known as PMA has been taken on by many of the restaurants and shops that have introduced charging pads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Samsung Galaxy S6, announced yesterday, is the first phone capable of using both standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Converters, which come in the form of small dongles, can be used to convert one to the other in most phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They can also be used to allow phones without wireless charging to make use of the technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ikea will sell cases for iPhones and older Samsung Galaxy phones so that they can make use of the standard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The charging furniture will go on sale in mid-April in Europe and the rest of the UK, and North America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The products will start from 30, Ikea said.</td></tr>
