<h3>Tunisia declares state of emergency</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tunisia's president has said the country is "not safe" from further extremist attacks and has declared a national state of emergency to avoid what he says is a risk of collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>President Beji Caid Essebsi's speech came just over a week after a gunman at the popular beach resort of Sousse attacked foreign tourists, killing 38 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Essebsi said the state of emergency would last 30 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tunisia was previously under a state of emergency from January 2011, at the outbreak of the Arab Spring, until March 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It initially included a curfew and a ban on meetings of more than three people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although those measures were relaxed, police and the military retained powers to intervene in unrest or for security reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Essebsi said an "exceptional situation required exceptional measures" but pledged to respect freedom of expression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Tunisia faces a very serious danger and it should take any possible measures to maintain security and safety," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"As we see in other countries, if attacks like Sousse happen again, the country will collapse."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Essebsi blamed the poor security in Libya for Tunisia's problems, and the lack of international resolve in targeting the Islamic State group throughout the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said Tunisia specifically had been a target of the extremist group because it had a functioning, secular democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The gunman behind the beach attack was killed by police and IS later claimed responsibility for the massacre, a blow to Tunisia's tourism industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Thirty of the 38 dead in the attack were British tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In March, gunmen killed 22 people, again mostly tourists, at the National Bardo Museum outside Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tunisia's government has promised new laws to increase police powers and provide for harsher penalties for terrorism convictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Immediately after the Sousse attack, the prime minister pledged to post armed guards at tourist sites and close mosques outside government control.</td></tr>
