<h3>APNewsBreak: Turkey holds suspected Syria-bound UK woman</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The woman, identified as J.N.H., was detained at a bus terminal in Ankara late Monday and is being held pending deportation hearings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One of the Turkish officials said authorities apprehended her based on Turkish intelligence and weren't tipped off by British authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The officials said that correspondence and images on the woman's cellphone indicate that she was planning to head to IS territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The two officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of government rules against speaking to the media without prior authorization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Turkish authorities began deportation proceedings following an interrogation of the woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The woman left the U.K. on a flight to Belgium on Saturday, according to the Turkish officials, and then continued on flights to Istanbul and Ankara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Authorities provided the AP with a copy of the woman's passport and a photograph of her in detention with details obscured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The photograph shows the woman seated and dressed mostly in black, wearing a headscarf and a leather jacket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The British Foreign Office released a statement confirming the detention of a British national in Ankara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It said British officials are providing consular assistance, but didn't give any other details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The woman is among a spate of young British travelers who have come through Turkey and are believed to be en route to Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Last week, three British teens were detained by Turkish authorities after arriving from Spain, and deported to Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Three British girls- identified by British authorities as Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15 - traveled last month from the U.K. to Turkey, from where they are believed to have crossed into Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier this month, a Turkish television station obtained video showing the girls at an Istanbul bus terminal before they boarded a bus to a city near Turkey's border with Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Tuesday, a British court banned a 16-year-old boy from traveling to stop him from following his three brothers, who fought with militants in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Two of them died there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There has been finger-pointing between Turkey and European countries over who is to blame for the flow from Europe through Turkey of IS fighters and supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Turkey has charged that European countries have often not provided timely information on travelers with suspected militant ties, while Western countries say Turkey has not done enough to seal its porous borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But following the arrest of the three British teens last week, both Turkey and Britain praised the cooperation.</td></tr>

<h3>U.S. Air Force veteran accused of trying to assist Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A federal grand jury in New York City indicted Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh for attempting to provide material support to the group and attempted obstruction of justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pugh, 47, of Neptune, N.J., is to be arraigned Wednesday morning in federal court in Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Michael Schneider, a court-appointed lawyer for Pugh, said his client would plead not guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prosecutors allege that Pugh, once an avionics instrument system specialist in the U.S. Air Force, attempted to join Islamic State in January by traveling from Egypt to Turkey and trying to cross the border into Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Turkish authorities sent him back to Egypt, which detained him and subsequently deported him to the United States, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Upon his arrival in Egypt, Pugh was carrying several electronic devices, including a mobile phone that had a photograph of a machine gun, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the United States, federal agents searched his laptop computer and other devices and found recent Internet searches for "borders controlled by Islamic State" and a propaganda video by the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Although Pugh was arrested in January, the case had been sealed until Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prosecutors said that in the weeks prior to traveling to Egypt, Pugh had been fired from his job as an airplane mechanic for an unidentified company in the Middle East and had lived abroad for a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Pugh appeared to have been on U.S. authorities' radar for some time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A criminal complaint filed at the time of his arrest said that while he was working as a mechanic for American Airlines, a co-worker tipped the FBI that Pugh "sympathized with Osama bin Laden, felt that the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies were justified and expressed anti-American sentiment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 2002, an associate told the FBI that Pugh expressed interest in going to Chechnya to fight, the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Despite that background, from October 2009 to March 2010, Pugh worked on aircraft avionics as an Army contractor for DynCorp International in Iraq, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A company spokeswoman had no immediate comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The complaint said from 1986 to 1990, Pugh served in the U.S. Air Force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He converted to Islam after moving to San Antonio, Texas, in 1998 and "became increasingly radical in his beliefs," it said.</td></tr>
