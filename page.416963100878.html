<h3>Former UNC coach, assistant Bill Guthridge dies at 77 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Bill Guthridge, the longtime assistant to Dean Smith who succeeded him as North Carolina's head coach, has died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was 77.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The school announced Wednesday that Guthridge died Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The cause of death was not immediately known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''If he told me to run through that wall to make me better, I'd hit that wall,'' former North Carolina player and well-traveled college coach Buzz Peterson told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Guthridge spent three decades as an assistant to Smith, helping him bring national championships to Chapel Hill in 1982 and 1993.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>When Smith retired as Division I's winningest men's coach shortly before the 1997-98 season, Guthridge was promoted to replace him, and he guided the Tar Heels to two Final Fours in three seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''Bill Guthridge was a gentleman coach, but a fierce competitor, and an incredibly loyal member of Dean Smith's staff for three decades,'' current athletic director Bubba Cunningham said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I learned very quickly when I came to Chapel Hill how beloved and respected he was by people all across this community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Guthridge went 80-28 from 1997-2000, reaching Final Fours in 1998 and 2000 before retiring that June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Smith died in February at age 83.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''They worked so well together,'' Peterson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''So much trust between those two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The careers and lives of the two coaches from Kansas were solidly intertwined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Both played college ball in that state - Smith at Kansas, Guthridge at Kansas State - and coached at their alma maters before coming to North Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Guthridge joined Smith's staff for the 1967-68 season, starting out as the freshman coach and a co-assistant varsity coach and eventually becoming the Hall of Famer's most trusted assistant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He also was an assistant to Smith on the 1976 U.S. Olympic team that won the gold medal in Montreal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Peterson - who roomed with Michael Jordan on those early 1980s teams - said Guthridge kept the program going off the court, with the assistant making him run the school's golf course at 6 a.m. as punishment for once being late.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We'd always say there were so many time zones - Eastern Standard Time, Central Standard Time - but the most important was GST: Guthridge Standard Time,'' Peterson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>North Carolina made 29 NCAA Tournament appearances in Guthridge's 33 years on the staff and finished no worse than third in the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season standings every year - with 16 first-place finishes and 10 more in second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Tar Heels either won the ACC Tournament or finished atop the league standings - or did both - in 23 of those seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After Smith retired in October 1997, then-athletic director Dick Baddour elevated Guthridge to the top job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That season, he led the Tar Heels to a 34-4 record and the final No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>1 ranking in the AP Top 25, earned the ACC Coach of the Year award and guided North Carolina to the Final Four before losing to Utah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Tar Heels then went 24-10 in 1998-99 but were upset by Weber State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In Guthridge's final season, he went 18-13 - at the time, the program's worst finish in decades - but bounced back in the postseason to reach North Carolina's 15th Final Four before losing in the national semifinals to Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He stepped down 2 1/2 months later.</td></tr>
