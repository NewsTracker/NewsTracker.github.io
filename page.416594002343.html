<h3>Things to Know About the City of Baltimore</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On Tuesday, swaths of East and West Baltimore erupted in flames amid riots that followed the funeral for Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old man who died a week after suffering a critical spine injury while in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a startlingly segregated city struggling with failing schools, failing infrastructure, a failing economy and a police department under federal investigation, it seemed only a matter of time before this side of Baltimore boiled over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Homelessness and poverty are pervasive problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Roughly 23 percent of the city is living below the poverty line, while unemployment is much higher than the national average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Late last year the city's housing authority opened its lottery for public housing for the first time in 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Within a week, roughly 60,000 people- nearly 10 percent of the city's population-had signed up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Baltimore is also a city of neglect, with roughly 17,000 abandoned row homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Sandtown, where Gray was raised and later arrested, whole city blocks sit vacant and neglected among empty lots overgrown with grass and littered with trash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Baltimore was once a prosperous city, celebrated by journalist H.L. Mencken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It was a manufacturing dynamo, famed for the rye whiskey and straw hats it made, among other things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the story of Baltimore is much the same as the rest of urban America since World War II: Industry left, and fortune followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Since the 1950s, the city's population has steadily declined, dwindling from nearly 1 million to 622,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The city saw growth for the first time in six decades when it gained more than 1,000 residents in 2012; the next year, the count slightly declined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The upheavals of the 1960s and '70s contributed to the disintegration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rioting after the Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Martin Luther King Jr.'s death in 1968 left scars on the landscape that have never healed, and strikes by police, teachers and municipal workers in 1974 hastened the city's decline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the 1990s, the crack cocaine and heroin trade was so robust that a federal study cited Baltimore as one of the country's most drug-addled cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Its reputation remains the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Drugs and crime prompted former governor Martin O'Malley to institute a "zero tolerance" policing policy once he became mayor of Baltimore in 2000, which many site as fanning the flames for mistrust between police and members of poor black communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In 2010, the ACLU and NAACP reached an $870,000 settlement with the city that required police to track their arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But by 2012, an independent auditor found Baltimore officers still couldn't justify 35 percent of their arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"When we adopted zero tolerance policing we were embedding in the police culture this mindset of being at war with the citizenry," said Sonia Kumar, an attorney at the ACLU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"At no point since then has that mindset been disrupted or challenged in any meaningful way."</td></tr>
