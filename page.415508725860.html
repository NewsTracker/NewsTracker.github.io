<h3>Facebook slaps ban on buttocks, buying drugs and celebrating crimes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The social network has been criticised in the past for inconsistency when it comes to user-published content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While images of breastfeeding have been tightly clamped down on, videos of beheadings have made it onto newsfeeds on more than one occasion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook has published a new Community Standards page, clarifying what it will allow to be posted on its site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This includes clarification that some nudity is allowed for artistic purposes, but images of genitals or buttocks will be taken down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now, the social media hub has clarified its policies with a new Community Standards section of the website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Facebook's had of global policy management, Monika Bickert, said in a blog post announcing the new page: 'Billions of pieces of content are shared on Facebook every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On the subject of direct physical threats, Facebook said it reviews all reports of threats to identify those which are credible to public and personal safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'We remove credible threats of physical harm to individuals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The site said it also factors in location when evaluating threats, including the status of the part of the world a threat has come from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Another key area to be addressed is self-harm, with the promotion of self-harm or suicide not allowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Facebook states it will remove content that 'promotes or encourages suicide or any other type of self-harm, including self-mutilation and eating disorders'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The site adds that it will not allow any content that identifies victims or survivors of self-harm or suicide and targets them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While confirming it doesn't consider body modification to be self-harm, it added it does allow the sharing of information about the topic of self-harm and suicide when it 'does not promote these things'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The new guidelines also say that Facebook does not allow any organisations to have a presence on the site that engage in terrorist activity, organised crime, or promoting hate against others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The site says it will also remove content expressing support for any groups involved in such behaviour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This comes in the wake of increased social media activity from organisations such as ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On nudity, the social giant said its policies can 'sometimes be more blunt than we would like', highlighting that while some nudity may be for a campaign or artistic purpose, some Facebook users in different parts of the world may be be sensitive to this type of content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As a result, Facebook said: 'We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures and other art that depicts nude figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for educational, humorous or satirical purposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>There is also a section on hate speech, with Facebook confirming it relies on users to report cases of hate speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>However, the new Community Standards page identifies prohibited content as anything that directly attacks people based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender, disability or disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The site added that it encourages people to 'challenge ideas, institutions and practices because such challenges can promote debate and greater understanding'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Facebook also said that it allows 'humour, satire or social commentary related to these topics' if the user is posting under their real identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The new guidelines also cover the area of violence and graphic content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Here, Facebook will continue to be a place where users can share experiences and raise awareness, says the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>'Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights abuses or acts of terrorism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In many instances, when people share this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness about it.</td></tr>

<h3>Ohio parents of three boys and grandmother killed in house fire are reunited with photos</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>About 260 photos, which were about the only items rescued from the December 26 fire in Washington Court House, Ohio, were painstakingly restored by art conservation undergraduates at the University of Delaware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Many of the photos were charred, covered in soot and stained by the water used to fight the blaze that took the lives of 60-year-old Terry Harris and her grandsons: Kenyon, 14, Broderick, 11, and Braylon, nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But after a range of restoration techniques were applied, the images were revealed in their former glory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police had said the boys wanted to spend Christmas night with their grandmother so she wouldn't be alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The state fire marshal's office said Friday that the cause of the blaze hasn't been determined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The restored photos were delivered to the family Friday in a tear-filled gathering in their hometown about 75 miles north of Cincinnati.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The boys' father, Ricky Harris, told those gathered for the delivery of the photos that he was very grateful to have the photos that include ones of his sons and mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'It is hard to see the photos, but it was always hard to look at old photos even when they were here because of the reminder of the time I had already lost with my boys and mom,' he told the Washington Court House Record Herald, saying he can't help but lament all the good times they had gone by.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Debra Hess Norris, chairwoman of the University of Delaware's art conservation department and a photograph conservation professor, delivered the photos to the family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She told The Associated Press in a telephone interview afterward that it was an emotional day and an honor to meet the family after working so long on their photographs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'I think we all felt so connected to the family,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Michael Emmons, a doctoral student in preservation studies at the University of Delaware and a Harris family friend, also helped deliver the photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Emmons, who found the photos at Ricky Harris' home where they had been taken after the fire, had sent the photos to Norris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'I wasn't even sure they could be restored,' he said by telephone afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>An unexpected result from the restoration work was the development of some new techniques for the preservation of fire-damaged photographs, Norris said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She said the family told her that Terry Harris had kept photos in a plastic bin in her home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'It was really a miracle that these photographs survived,' Norris said.</td></tr>
