<h3>Ukraine marks anniversary of 1986 Chernobyl disaster</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko paid his respects to the victims of the Chernobyl disaster on Sunday marking the 29th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It happened 29 years ago today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>04.26.1986.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>#Chernobyl, #Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>More than 30 people died immediately after the explosion in 1986 and more than 4,000 people were killed in the aftermath of the blast and subsequent fire, succumbing to radiation-related diseases contracted after taking part in the cleanup effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The plant's fourth reactor, which back in 1986 suffered an explosion sending a cloud of radioactive material into the atmosphere, is currently being encased in what's called a New Safe Confinement structure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The new arch which is the height of a 30 thirty-story building has to cover the fourth Chernobyl nuclear reactor by 2017. Ukraine needs about 500 million euro for this project and wants help from European donors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The structure which is to prevent further leakage of radioactive material will do nothing for the abandoned nearby city of Pripyat which was home to 50,000 people before the disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile in neighbouring Belarus, demonstrators marked the Chernobyl anniversary with a protest at the construction of a new nuclear plant being built not far from the capital Minsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's being funded by the Russian company ROSATOM.</td></tr>
