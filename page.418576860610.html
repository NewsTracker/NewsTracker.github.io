<h3>Spieth opens bid with good round, familiar foe in Scotland (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- Jordan Spieth wasted no time seizing a rare opportunity to chase a Grand Slam, opening with six birdies in 11 holes at St. Andrews and keeping his name high on the leaderboard Thursday in the British Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And so did a familiar foe - Dustin Johnson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Eight times zones and an ocean away from Chambers Bay, Johnson and Spieth picked up where they left off a month ago when Spieth beat him by one shot in the U.S. Open to capture the second leg of the Grand Slam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On this day, Johnson got the better of him with a 7-under 65 and looked like the player to beat at St. Andrews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He overpowered the Old Course with such a blend of power and accuracy that Johnson hit wedge into all but three of the 14 par 4s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Three of them were into the wind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The other was No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>9, where he putted from just off the green.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Johnson had a one-shot lead over six players, including former British Open champion Paul Lawrie, two-time U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen and Jason Day, playing for the first time since coping with symptoms of vertigo at the U.S. Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Zach Johnson and Danny Willett played in the afternoon as the wind strengthened, making their 66s even more impressive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Spieth and Louis Oosthuizen, who won the last time the Open was at St. Andrews, were among those two shots back at 67.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thursday morning was suited for scoring, so it was critical Johnson, Spieth and all the other early starters post a low score.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''Everybody knows the weather Friday and Saturday is going to be very difficult, so today I thought was very important to get off to a good start and try to make as many birdies as you can,'' Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It was every bit of that for Tiger Woods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A two-time Open champion on these links, Woods hit into the Swilcan Burn on the first hole, didn't make a birdie until the 14th hole and had to scramble to salvage a 76, his worst score in 13 rounds as a pro at St. Andrews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He was tied with 65-year-old Tom Watson, who had a 76 in his final British Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The buzz came from the top of the leaderboard, especially with Johnson and Spieth making this feel like the U.S. Open, except for the location and green color of grass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Spieth opened with two straight birdies and looked as solid as ever with the putter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Johnson also converted putts after wedges into so many greens for birdie, along with a 7-iron into 10 feet on the par-5 fifth hole for eagle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They are playing together for the opening two rounds, and they laughed and chatted as if this were Thursday at a regular PGA Tour event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''No chat about the U.S. Open at all, as I wouldn't imagine there would be, other than talking about the differences in the course,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''But I enjoy playing with Dustin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He also knows what to expect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Johnson is among the most athletic players in golf, and the most powerful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He was dialed in at Chambers Bay, and it appeared as though the three weeks he spent away from competition didn't hurt him in the least.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Spieth was along for the ride when Johnson stayed on the attack, often hitting it some 50 yards past Spieth and Matsuyama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Along with five birdies and an eagle, Johnson saved par from 10 feet and 15 feet on the 16th and 17th holes as the wind gained strength.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''If D.J. keeps driving it the way he is, then I'm going to have to play my best golf to have a chance,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Spieth managed just fine with great iron play and the putting that makes him the envy of golf at the moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He now has made 53 birdies in nine rounds at the majors this year, an average of roughly one birdie every three holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>So it was peculiar when one reporter asked Spieth if he thought he could beat Johnson - which he just did a month ago at the U.S. Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''I've played enough golf with him to where I believe in my skill set, that I can still trump that crazy ability that he has,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''I expect when he stands on the tee it's going to up there miles and down the fairway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Not many can appreciate the route Spieth is taking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Only five other players dating to the creation of the Masters in 1934 have won the first two majors of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Only the late Ben Hogan can claim the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open in the same year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>No one has won all four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The key for Spieth was to stay close, and that's what he did - not in driving distance, but by score, which ultimately is all that matters.</td></tr>
