<h3>Earthquakes on Hawaii volcano could signal new eruption</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HONOLULU (AP) - A series of earthquakes and shifting ground on the slopes of Kilauea have scientists wondering what will happen next at one of the world's most active volcanos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A lake of lava near the summit of Kilauea on Hawaii's Big Island had risen to a record-high level after a recent explosion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But in the past few days, the pool of molten rock began sinking, and the surface of the lava lake fell nearly 500 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Meanwhile, a rash of earthquakes rattled the volcano with as many as 20 to 25 quakes per hour, and scientists' tilt meters detected that the ground was deforming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Clearly the lava, by dropping out of sight, it has to be going somewhere," said Steven Brantley, deputy scientist in charge of Hawaiian Volcano Observatory of the U.S. Geological Survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One possibility is that a new lava eruption could break through the surface of the mountain, Brantley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Right now, there are two active eruptions on Kilauea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One is the eruption spewing into the lava lake in the Halemaumau Crater, which is visible in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The other is Puu Oo vent, in Kilauea's east rift zone, which sent fingers of lava toward the town of Pahoa before stopping outside a shopping center last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The flurry of earthquakes that peaked in intensity Friday have been rattling Kilauea's southwest rift zone, so it's possible that a new eruption could occur southwest of the Halemaumau Crater, or even in the crater itself, Brentley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Or, the tilting, shifting ground could lead to nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We don't know what the outcome of this activity might be," Brantley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"That is the challenge, is trying to interpret what this activity really means in terms of the next step for Kilauea."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An eruption on the southwest side wouldn't pose a threat to the population, because the area is generally closed to the public and there aren't any structures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The earthquake activity had slowed Saturday morning, and scientists were continuing to watch the volcano closely, Brantley said.</td></tr>
