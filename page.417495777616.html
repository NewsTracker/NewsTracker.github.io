<h3>Google founder defends accident records of self-driving cars</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - Google co-founder Sergey Brin says the Internet company isn't releasing the accident reports involving its self-driving cars to protect the privacy of the other motorists in the crashes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Brin's explanation came in response to a question posed Wednesday by a company critic during Google's annual shareholders meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Even if names were censored from the records, Brin says the documents filed with California regulators wouldn't reveal anything different from what Google previously disclosed about the self-driving cars' collisions in a summary posted online three weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brin says the total number of accidents climbed to 12 within the past week when another of Google's self-driving cars was rear-ended at a traffic signal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google says its self-driving cars were at fault in just one of the accidents.</td></tr>
