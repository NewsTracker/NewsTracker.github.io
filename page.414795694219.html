<h3>Boko Haram insurgents attack Cameroon army base, several wounded</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chad, Niger and Cameroon have begun a joint offensive against Boko Haram militants who have killed thousands of people in a bid to carve out an Islamist emirate in northern Nigeria, and have increasingly staged raids across nearby borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The wounded are being evacuated. The insurgents have been stopped. An APC (armored personnel carrier) was taken from them and several of them were killed," a Cameroonian military officer told journalists in Maroua, adding the incident was continuing.</td></tr>
