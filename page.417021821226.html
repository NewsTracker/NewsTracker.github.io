<h3>US Team Pulls Woman From Collapsed 4-Story Building in Nepal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. rescuers from California and Virginia helped pull a 41-year-old woman from a four-story building that collapsed in the magnitude-7.3 earthquake in Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tuesday's temblor was an aftershock to the April 25 earthquake that killed more than 8,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>James Fleming, director of USAID's Nepal Earthquake Response, said its Disaster Assistance Response Team includes 57 elite urban search and rescuers each from Los Angeles County and Fairfax County, Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They happened to remain in country and experienced the massive aftershock after many other search and rescue teams had left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It was remarkable that they were still there because they were able to quickly scour Kathmandu for potential people who needed rescue," Fleming said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"What was even more remarkable was to have this live rescue of the 41-year-old woman near the epicenter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While some members remained in Kathmandu to help search, others flew to Charikot and Singati, a mountain village roughly 20 miles southwest of Mount Everest, immediately after the aftershock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The woman was rescued from the building rubble Tuesday after several hours of digging and drilling in Singati.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Her condition was unknown but she was eating, drinking and able to move after the rescue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Overnight, teams set up campfires to keep people warm and provided medical aid to the injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Wednesday, the woman and 11 other injured people were taken to a Kathmandu airport field hospital set up by the team for further treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A total of about 50 people were airlifted there for treatment from the multiple locations after the aftershock, Fleming said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Last month, the teams helped rescue a teenage boy who had been trapped under the rubble for five days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"To see the level of professionalism and the risk these people take to save lives is really incredible," Fleming said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Disaster Assistance Response Team, which also includes 22 USAID disaster experts and 12 dogs, surveyed 130 buildings and bridges for earthquake damage along with conducting other rescue efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Team members, who include structural engineers, also advised Nepal officials on the stability of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Fleming said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Los Angeles County Fire Department urban search and rescue team and Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department's team are FEMA and internationally-certified rescue teams that have deployed to tragedies such as the 2010 Haiti quake and to the 2011 Japan quake that triggered a massive tsunami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They were sent to Nepal shortly after the main quake hit and have worked alongside other rescue teams from neighboring India, China and Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.S. search and rescue teams have wrapped up their work in their assigned area and its members are expected to be back home by next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The 22 USAID disaster experts will remain in the country to focus on issues including shelter, water sanitation and hygiene, Fleming said.</td></tr>
