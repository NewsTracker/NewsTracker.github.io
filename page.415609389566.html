<h3>Plans for leisurely visit in Tunisia turn to horror</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>By the end, after police traded fire with the gunmen and special forces barreled in, the duo and 21 others were dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tunisia's deadliest terror attack in more than a decade jolted locals out of their daily routines and took the lives of visitors to this democracy-minded North African country of 11 million, according to Associated Press interviews with witnesses, victims and a police official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wednesday's attack at Tunis' National Bardo Museum, claimed by the Islamic State group that has sought to spread its bloodthirsty influence beyond its base in Syria and Iraq, drew immediate condemnation from many world leaders and promises from Tunisian officials and citizens that they won't bow to terror.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Miami resident Giovana Gonzalez had just finished a brief bathroom break at the end of a museum tour when the attackers "started shooting everybody."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Everyone ran in different directions," Gonzalez told reporters after disembarking from her cruise ship Friday in Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gonzalez, 46, and her husband were on a cruise to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For Mohamed Ali, an unemployed 42-year-old father of four who lives in the Bardo district, the episode upended a family stroll to the zoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Looking in through a high fence around the museum grounds next to parliament, he saw men pull automatic weapons out of bags and calmly walk inside, opening fire on tourists either inside a bus or emerging from it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There were police on one side of the bus that they set upon, and the terrorists were hiding on the other side," he told The Associated Press in an interview in the popular La Gazelle cafe across the street a day after the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There was an exchange of fire, and the gunmen took refuge in the museum."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said counterterrorism forces arrived within 10 minutes and prevented the carnage from being far bloodier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Their intervention stopped the terrorists from setting off their explosive belts, which would have caused more than 100 deaths if they had detonated," he said Friday in a televised address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A police captain, speaking to the AP, recalled how at 12:17 p.m. he heard the rat-a-tat of repeated shots and rushed to the museum entrance, where a woman lay injured on the stone-tile floor and two other people were strewn on an adjacent lawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Inside, many museumgoers had little or no place to hide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some tucked behind thin columns, or cowered on the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>One French visitor with a bandaged knee, speaking afterward to France 2 Television, said she'd only survived because a person in front of her took a bullet to the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Giovana and Hector Gonzalez hid behind pillars in the labyrinth-like museum for three to four hours, cringing at the sound of gunfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"When we had the feeling that the bullets were coming closer, we tried to hide ourselves in different places and we were running from one place to another," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We changed our position a lot."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The 50-year-old police captain, in a police ball cap and three shiny stars on the breastplate of his bulletproof vest, said at least one assailant made his way to the roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Authorities said they were looking for at least two or three accomplices of the two gunmen who were killed, and later made several arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The captain and a colleague fired upward to give cover to a police car that hurriedly took away a visitor who had been shot in the hip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Collecting himself with a cigarette as he recounted the attack, the officer's eyes welled up when he thought of helping four injured visitors into emergency vehicles, leaving blood on his hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The officer said he couldn't aim his gun well because his main concern was protecting the injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He declined to provide his name, insisting he was doing his duty and did not want to be publicly associated with the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Police cars and ambulances rushed in, and a helicopter soared overhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Special forces - with their armored vehicle crunching two track-like welts into the floor tiles - were next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Aside from the attackers, the only other Tunisian killed was a special forces officer that the captain said had recently become a father.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>By varying accounts, the end of the siege lasted no more than an hour or so, and special forces gunned down the attackers inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Scores of tourists - some parents carting small children - scurried up the steps of a nearby building to take shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But Gonzalez, who had become separated from her husband, didn't know if the armed men dressed in plainclothes were police or hostage-takers as she ran with them, crouching to take cover behind cars along the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I thought to myself we weren't going to get out of this," Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I didn't think we were going to live so I called my daughter to say goodbye to her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>One Spanish couple, Juan Carlos Sanchez and Cristina Rubio, had holed up in a small room in the museum, where they had hid after he spotted a fleeing man, and spent the night there because they thought the gunmen might still be around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Rubio, who is pregnant, was uninjured and told Tunisia's health minister at a hospital maternity ward that tests showed that the baby girl on the way was OK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Seventeen of the 20 foreigners who were killed had been cruise-ship passengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Health Ministry officials said Japanese, French, Italian, British, Polish, Spanish, Australian, Colombian and Belgian citizens were among the dead, and several remained unidentified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It was the deadliest terror attack in Tunisia since an al-Qaida militant set off a truck bomb outside a historic synagogue on the resort island of Djerba in 2002, killing 21 people - mostly German tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Tunis resident Mohamed Aziz Smiri said he saw the evacuation from the museum, and heard police assurances that the situation was under control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He noted that extremists had generally attacked security forces in Tunisia's rural west near Algeria in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Every time they kill Tunisian security forces, and now tourists," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"It's haram (a sin), they came as guests to our country. I didn't want that for them, it makes me feel sorry, we're sad ... What did they do to us?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Gonzalez didn't learn until she was back on the cruise ship that seven of the 40 people on her tour excursion bus had died and seven were injured.</td></tr>

<h3>Eyeing Russia nervously, Poles enrol in volunteer militias</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Polish government has kept its distance from the unofficial civilian militias but, with anxieties about Moscow's intentions growing, the professional military is now looking for ways to harness the volunteer groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There are an estimated 120 such groups in Poland, with total membership around 10,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Eight hundred members gathered on Friday in Warsaw at a meeting organized by the Defense Ministry, the first time they have been given official recognition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Defense Minister Tomasz Siemoniak told them his ministry would pay the wages of 2,500 people who would form the backbone of local volunteer units to be mobilized in the event of a war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Polish president's chief security adviser, General Stanislaw Koziej, told Reuters the new approach had been prompted by the conflict in neighboring Ukraine, where Russia is accused of fighting alongside pro-Moscow separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Until recently, paramilitary organizations treated defense as a pastime," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Today, as we face a war across our border, they realize that this pastime could contribute to the country's security."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Poland is a member of NATO, but the defense alliance rejected requests from Warsaw to establish a substantial permanent presence on Polish soil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That has shaken Poles' faith in NATO's resolve, officials in Warsaw say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Instead, Poland is counting on a bilateral defense partnership with the United States, while building up its own defense capability, both conventional and unconventional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On a Saturday morning in March, 15 volunteers from the National Defense militia, an informal volunteer group, gathered in the rain and bitter cold in a forest near Minsk Mazowiecki, 40 km (25 miles) from Warsaw, to plan their weekly maneuvers on a map sketched in the sandy soil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Dressed in full military camouflage with fake rifles in their hands, the volunteers eagerly consulted a dog-eared photocopy of a military handbook before splitting into teams to practise ambushing an enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Bernard Bartnicki, a student who led the drill, said the war in Ukraine boosted the organization's ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Back in the day we would have two, maybe three people at our recruitment days, now it's 20, sometimes 30" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>General Boguslaw Pacek, a defense ministry adviser, has conducted a countrywide survey and estimated total membership at around 10,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some of the 120 or so groups have as few as 30 members, Pacek says, and their skill levels vary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But because they are scattered all over the country, they could form a useful line of local defense in the event of war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said the army was looking into compiling training manuals for them and supplying them with surplus equipment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>During World War Two, when Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany, the Polish government-in-exile commanded an underground partisan "Home Army" that ambushed German troops, staged acts of sabotage and mounted the ill-fated 1944 Warsaw Uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Many defense analysts say a Russian attack on Poland is highly unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Countries such as Moldova, Latvia or Estonia, with substantial Russian-speaking minorities, are much more likely targets, they say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But suspicion of Moscow runs deep in Poland, which was ruled by Czarist Russia for over a century and under Soviet domination for over four decades after World War Two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It borders on Russia's Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Moscow denies it has any plans for an offensive and says it has no direct role in the fighting in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Robert Przybyl, a 42-year-old project manager, joined a civilian militia unit after Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 came down over eastern Ukraine in July last year, killing all 298 passengers and crew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Kiev and its Western allies blamed Russia and the Moscow-backed separatists, who responded that Ukraine's military had shot the plane down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Przybyl said he was shocked at what happened and started to worry Poland was again coming under attack by a foreign power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I want to decide what country my son lives in, and what language he speaks," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>His unit, also part of the National Defense militia, was carrying out exercises in a forest near Otwock, near Warsaw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>New recruits took 5-km (3-mile) marches to test their stamina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Let's be honest, at war we would likely be cannon fodder," Przybyl said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But he said it was his duty to serve if war does break out.</td></tr>
