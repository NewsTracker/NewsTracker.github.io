<h3>If you use Safari on a Mac, iPhone or iPad in the UK ? you've won the right to SUE Google</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GOOGLE has today lost a Court of Appeal bid to stop British consumers gaining the right to sue over a breach of privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google said it was "disappointed with the court's decision" - which lawyers claim potentially "opens the door for litigation by MILLIONS of British Apple users".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One of the claimants has branded the case a "David and Goliath victory".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Today's decision is a victory for a small group fighting for the right to take action against Google over claims the internet giant bypassed security settings in the Apple Safari internet browser, which is installed on all Mac computers, iPhones and iPads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The claimants, who include editor and publisher Judith Vidal-Hall and IT security company directors Robert Hann and Marc Bradshaw, accused Google of collecting private information without their knowledge and consent between summer 2011 and spring 2012 - using cookies in order to target them with personalised advertisements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A High Court judge previously rejected an attempt by Google to block the litigation, and today three appeal judges upheld his decision, saying the claims "raise serious issues which merit a trial".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Google tried to prevent the action - claiming there was no case to answer since the consumers had not suffered any financial harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the Court of Appeal has ruled: "These claims raise serious issues which merit a trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They concern what is alleged to have been the secret and blanket tracking and collation of information, often of an extremely private nature [...] about and associated with the claimants' internet use, and the subsequent use of that information for about nine months. The case relates to the anxiety and distress this intrusion upon autonomy has caused."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ms Vidal-Hall welcomed the decision and said: "This is a David and Goliath victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The Court of Appeal has ensured Google cannot use its vast resources to evade English justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Ordinary computer users like me will now have the right to hold this giant to account before the courts for its unacceptable, immoral and unjust actions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Law firm Olswang, which represented the three claimants, said the ruling potentially opens the door to litigation by millions of Britons who used Apple computers, iPhones, iPods and iPads during the relevant period of summer 2011 and spring 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dan Tench, partner at Olswang, said: "This is an important decision by the Court of Appeal that prevents Google from evading or trivialising these very serious intrusions into the privacy of British consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Google, a company that makes billions from advertising knowledge, claims that it was unaware that it was secretly tracking Apple users for a period of nine months, and had argued that no harm was done because the matter was trivial, as consumers had not lost out financially.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The Court of Appeal saw these arguments for what they are: a breach of consumers' civil rights and actionable before the English courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We look forward to holding Google to account for its actions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Jonathan Hawker represents the Google Action Group, a not-for-profit company set up to manage claims against the internet giant for breach of privacy through the Safari workaround.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Hawker said: "Anyone who used the Safari browser during the relevant period now has the right to join our claim against Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Whilst it has the resources to fight individual claimants, together we have the resources and funding to bring this serious matter before the English courts and to attempt to recover damages for Safari users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We urge all Safari users to join us in this battle to hold Google to account for its actions in the only way it understands."</td></tr>
