<h3>The Mirage volcano in Las Vegas to erupt less frequently</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Dec. 8, 2008 file photo, the Mirage Volcano erupts at the Mirage hotel and casino in Las Vegas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The man-made volcano that has been spewing fire and water since the hotel's 1989 opening will now offer two to three free nightly shows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Before Monday the volcano erupted every half-hour beginning at about dusk until midnight, wind permitting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Mirage volcano on the Las Vegas Strip is erupting less frequently, but not for any geological reason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The man-made volcano that has been spewing fire and water since the hotel's 1989 opening, a first-of-its-kind attraction, will now offer two to three nightly shows as the Strip's topography continues to evolve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Before Monday, the volcano erupted every half-hour beginning at about dusk until midnight, wind permitting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"With the variety of offerings on the Las Vegas Strip today, in contrast to 25 years ago, it made sense to us to reduce the number of shows in a way that wouldn't diminish the visitor experience," according to a statement from MGM Resorts Inc., which owns The Mirage casino-hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The company will monitor how much money the change saves, how much it will cut energy consumption and the reaction of visitors, company spokeswoman Mary Hynes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There's nothing in the works to change the frequency of the company's Bellagio fountain show, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The volcano is scheduled to erupt at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An additional 10 p.m. show will be offered Friday and Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Strip evolved into something more akin to a theme park when casino mogul Steve Wynn debuted the volcano at The Mirage, which was followed by a fiery pirate ship battle in front of the Treasure Island and the now-iconic fountain show in front of the Bellagio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since then, the Strip has never stopped evolving, said David Schwartz, director of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' Center for Gaming Research.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I think what gets people inside is shifting," Schwartz said of what drives a tourist to venture from the sidewalk into a casino.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There are simply more entertainment options, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Large-scale free entertainment outside of the area's casinos has diminished in recent years, but street-facing restaurants and retail, where money can be made, have cropped up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Treasure Island was sold in 2009, and the pirate battle disappeared nearly two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>After becoming the owner of The Mirage, MGM spent $25 million in 2008 upgrading the volcano with more fire choreographed to a pounding drum-beat soundtrack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At the time, executives said the challenge continued to be getting the show's numerous watchers to walk inside the casino to spend money.</td></tr>
