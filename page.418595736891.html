<h3>Suicide bombs kill 64 in northeast Nigeria on Muslim holiday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Suicide bombs have killed at least 64 people in multiple blasts in the northeastern towns of Gombe and Damaturu, officials said Friday, scaring people into staying home during the Muslim Eid al-Fitr celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police say two women suicide bombers killed 12 people at two prayer grounds in Damaturu on Friday morning as people were preparing to celebrate the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Another 75 wounded are being treated in two hospitals there, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The blasts are blamed on Nigeria's home-grown Boko Haram Islamic extremist group which has launched a string of attacks that have killed hundreds during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ended Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The upsurge in attacks followed a directive to create more mayhem during Ramadan from the Islamic State group, to which Boko Haram has sworn allegiance.</td></tr>
