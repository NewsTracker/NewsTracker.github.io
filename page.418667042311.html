<h3>'Mr. Holmes' meets his match in Mr. McKellen</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I have been alone, all my life," says 93-year-old Sherlock Holmes (Ian McKellen), and you hear every one of his years in that voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Mr. Holmes," directed by Bill Condon and based on a novel by Mitch Cullin, isn't really a mystery, though it presents a few puzzles to solve; instead, it's a gentle examining of life near its end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And with McKellen at its center, his face as gloriously long and complex as a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle plot, it's also a master class in acting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Mr. Holmes" entwines three stories, with the main action taking place in 1947: Holmes, long retired, now lives in the south of England, in a rural home he shares with his taciturn housekeeper, Mrs. Munro (Laura Linney), and her 10-year-old son, Roger (Milo Parker).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There, he tends to his beloved bees, and worries about the case that caused him to retire almost 30 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>We're taken back to 1919 London to learn that story, and also to Japan, where Holmes has traveled just after the war to find a plant that may help him with his memory problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>None of these stories by themselves is particularly compelling, and with a lesser actor at its soul "Mr. Holmes" might well seem slight, predictable, even twee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But McKellen, who's in nearly every scene, makes every moment count.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Watch how the 76-year-old actor differentiates, subtly but distinctively, between Holmes of 1947 and of 1919; the younger (though not so young) man stands slightly more erect, speaks with more confidence, seems less haunted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The older Holmes, whose memories are slipping away, has a sadness in his eyes, a way of holding a gaze a little longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The mind is still whirring, but occasionally the wheels pause; in those moments, there's a heartbreaking sense of desperation, of someone knowing that his most valued possession may soon be out of reach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This Sherlock occasionally makes amused reference to his semi-fictional counterpart; noting that he couldn't smoke a pipe in public after Watson's stories were published ("it seemed vulgar") and observing that, after a mishap, "I look like I've been attacked by the Hound of the Baskervilles."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In McKellen's hands, he's a unique blend of deduction, gruffness, sincerity, wonder and bass-toned pronouncement; you miss him, once the movie's done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Starring Ian McKellen, Laura Linney, Milo Parker, Hiroyuki Sanada, Hattie Morahan, Patrick Kennedy, Nicholas Rowe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Directed by Bill Condon, from a screenplay by Jeffrey Hatcher, based on the novel "A Slight Trick of the Mind" by Mitch Cullin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>105 minutes.</td></tr>
