<h3>Nepal quake death toll tops 4,000; villages plead for aid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - As the death toll from Nepal's devastating earthquake climbed past 4,000, aid workers and officials in remote, shattered villages near the epicenter pleaded Monday for food, shelter and medicine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Help poured in after Saturday's magnitude-7.8 quake, with countries large and small sending medical and rescue teams, aircraft and basic supplies.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>Conditions were far worse in the countryside, with rescue workers still struggling to reach mountain villages two days after the earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some roads and trails to the Gorkha district, where the quake was centered, were blocked by landslides - but also by traffic jams that regularly clog the route north of Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There are people who are not getting food and shelter. I've had reports of villages where 70 percent of the houses have been destroyed," said Udav Prashad Timalsina, the top official for the Gorkha region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>World Vision aid worker Matt Darvas arrived in the district in the afternoon and said almost no assistance had reached there ahead of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Newer concrete buildings were intact, Darvas said, but some villages were reported to be devastated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He cited a "disturbing" report from the village of Singla, where up to 75 percent of the buildings may have collapsed and there has been no contact since Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the villages that have been reached, World Vision said the greatest needs were for search-and-rescue teams, food, blankets, tarps and medical treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Timalsina said 223 people had been confirmed dead in Gorkha district but he presumed "the number would go up because there are thousands who are injured."</td></tr>

<tr><td>32</td><td>"We are appealing for tents, dry goods, blankets, mattresses, and 80 different medicines that the health department is seeking that we desperately need now," said Lila Mani Poudyal, Nepal's chief secretary and rescue coordinator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"We don't have the helicopters that we need or the expertise to rescue the people trapped."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>As people are pulled from the wreckage, he said, even more help is needed, including orthopedic doctors, nerve specialists, surgeons and paramedics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"We are appealing to foreign governments to send these specialized and smart teams," Poudyal added.</td></tr>

<tr><td>49</td><td>Among them was Prabina Mainali, a 26-year-old teacher who gave birth to a boy earlier Monday in a Kathmandu hospital - a bit of good news in a sea of despair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"It's hard that he can't be in his own home right now. He should be there, we should be there, but we aren't safe.
