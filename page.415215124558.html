<h3>Syrian opposition to post thousands of photos of dead prisoners taken by defector 'Caesar'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nearly 27,000 photos of Syrian detainees have been turned over to the FBI for analysis but the Syrian opposition is taking the unusual step of publishing those in which the victims' facial features have not been blurred or otherwise disguised, as they have been in the past because of privacy concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The pictures were smuggled out of Syria by a former Syrian police photographer and renowned defector, who uses the pseudonym Caesar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry told a United Nations human rights body in Geneva that the photos Caesar provided showed graphic evidence of torture at the hands of the Syrian government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Many of the faces in the photos are emaciated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some show signs of beatings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Some of the victims are women, and some are very young.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Markings on their foreheads, which were applied by Syrian government officials, indicate the detention centre where the prisoners were incarcerated and which security agency was responsible for them before they died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By publishing photos of the victims, the opposition is trying to make it possible for relatives to pick them out and, more important for potential legal action, confirm their nationality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If some of the victims can be shown to have been dual citizens of Britain, Spain, Turkey, the United States or other countries, that would assist the effort to pursue charges for war crimes in courts in those nations, opponents of the Assad government say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It is essential that those responsible are brought before a court of law, whether that is The Hague, New York, London or Madrid," said Toby Cadman, a London-based lawyer who is representing Caesar and his supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The photos are being published on two opposition websites: a Facebook page maintained by Caesar's supporters, and a site that focuses on the plight of political prisoners and missing Syrians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"In order to be able to be effective in the pursuit of justice for the victims, we must have witnesses and plaintiffs to begin the legal process in national courts where we are planning prosecutions against the Assad regime for war crimes," said Mouaz Moustafa, who has served as a representative in Washington for Caesar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It is also important to bring closure for families by helping them identify their missing loved ones."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Caesar, who is living in an undisclosed location in Europe, has played a central role in revealing human rights abuses at the hands of the Syrian government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He did not start out as an activist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Caesar was photographing accident scenes for Syria's military police when the conflict erupted and he was assigned to take pictures of bodies from detention centres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Many displayed signs of torture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Concluding that he was documenting war crimes, Caesar downloaded copies of the photos and defected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Obama administration officials believe that the photos are authentic and have praised him for revealing the abuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In July, Caesar visited Washington, where, wearing a hood to hide his identity, he briefed a congressional panel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He also appeared at the Holocaust Memorial Museum, visited the White House and met Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Anyone who has seen the images will never forget them," Mr Kerry said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Maimed bodies, people with their eyes gouged out, emaciated prisoners. It defies anybody's sense of humanity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But Caesar's revelations have not led to concerted international action against the Assad government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Russia's veto power in the UN Security Council has posed an obstacle for referring war crimes allegations against Assad to the International Criminal Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In providing the photos to the US, Caesar and his supporters hoped that the Obama administration would help the legal efforts to hold the Assad government accountable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In July, Caesar gave 26,948 of his photographs to the FBI, and the bureau was to evaluate their authenticity and provide assessments of its findings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The painstaking work was difficult, and there was no deadline for completing it, a senior US law enforcement official said in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>To try to identify the victims, US officials have been using facial recognition software to compare the photos that Caesar provided with visa and passport photos in the US State Department's database and with photos in a separate terrorism database.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But only a small number of possible identifications have been made, say US lawmakers who were briefed on the results last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>As a result, Caesar's supporters decided to take matters into their own hands by posting thousands of the photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Regrettably, the FBI has not yet disclosed its findings," Mr Cadman, the London-based lawyer, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"That has prompted our team to make a very difficult decision to set up a process by which family members can go through a collection of images with a view to identifying missing loved ones that they believe were arbitrarily arrested, tortured and possibly murdered by the regime."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>If charges are pursued abroad or in the US, Caesar may also testify, his representative, Moustafa, says.</td></tr>

<h3>Surrender or face death: Chad president to Boko Haram leader</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>2, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>N'DJAMENA - President Idriss Deby of Chad said on Wednesday he knew the whereabouts of Abubakar Shekau, the leader of the Nigerian militant group Boko Haram, and called on him to surrender or risk being killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chad's army has waged a series of battles against Boko Haram as part of a cross-border military campaign and has re-taken territory the militant group held in northeastern Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>" Abubakar Shekau must surrender. We know where he is. If he doesn't give himself up he will suffer the same fate as his compatriots," he told a news conference after a regional meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He was in Dikwa two days ago. He managed to get away but we know where he is. It's in his interests to surrender," Deby said, referring to a town in northeastern Nigeria held by Boko Haram that fell to Chad's army earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nigeria's presidency declined to comment on Deby's remarks and a defence spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nigeria's military has said on at least three occasions it had killed Shekau, or a man claiming to be him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Each time the leader has resurfaced to issue a fresh jihadist video, one of numerous videos the group has made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Chadian army is considered one of the best in the region, backed by a strong air force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It first deployed to help Cameroon fend off Boko Haram and is now pressing southwest into Nigerian territory after capturing the border town of Gambaru last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Boko Haram, a Sunni militant group, has killed thousands of people in Nigeria during a six-year insurgency to carve out an Islamic caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It has also staged a series of recent cross- border attacks into Chad, Cameroon and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Wednesday, a bomb planted and remotely detonated by Boko Haram militants near the southeastern Niger town of Diffa killed two soldiers and wounded a third, Niger military sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In a separate attack, armed men on a motorbike killed at least two people in Kerawa, in the Far North region of Cameroon, on Tuesday around 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), according to a Cameroon army officer who declined to be identified.</td></tr>
