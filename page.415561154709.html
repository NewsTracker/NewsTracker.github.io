<h3>U.S. rebukes Israel's victorious Netanyahu on Mideast policy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Even as President Barack Obama's administration congratulated Netanyahu for his party's decisive win, the White House signaled its deep disagreements - and thorny relationship - with Netanyahu will persist on issues ranging from Middle East peacemaking to Iran nuclear diplomacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a hard-right shift in the final days of campaigning, Netanyahu backtracked on his support for eventual creation of a Palestinian state - the cornerstone of more than two decades of peace efforts - and promised to continue building Jewish settlements on occupied land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Such policies could put him on a new collision course with the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some Obama aides had privately left little doubt during the Israeli election campaign of their preference for Netanyahu's center-left challenger, Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest reaffirmed Obama's commitment to a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict and said that based on Netanyahu's comments, "the United States will evaluate our approach to this situation moving forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Netanyahu's insistence that there will be no Palestinian state while he holds office, seen as a maneuver to mobilize his right-wing base, angered the Palestinians and drew criticism from the United Nations and European governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chances for restarting long-stalled peace moves already had been low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>U.S. lawmakers were divided on Netanyahu's hardened stance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It was remarkable to back-track so significantly on a two-state solution," said Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, adding it could make Washington's effort to mediate more difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he hoped the United States and Israel would see the election as "an opportunity to start over."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he said: "A two-state solution is impossible as long as Hamas exists and runs Gaza."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Earnest said the administration would communicate its concern directly to the Israeli government over rhetoric used by Netanyahu's campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Netanyahu charged on election day in Israel that left-wingers were trying to get Arab-Israeli voters out "in droves" to sway the election against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The United States and this administration is deeply concerned about rhetoric that seeks to marginalize Arab-Israeli citizens," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Arabs comprise about 20 percent of Israel's population of eight million and have long complained about discrimination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They emerged from Tuesday's vote as the third largest party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two weeks ago Netanyahu defied Obama with a politically divisive speech to Congress attacking U.S.-led nuclear talks with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Earnest predicted that Netanyahu's re-election would have no "material impact" on the sensitive Iran negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Secretary of State John Kerry called Netanyahu on Wednesday to congratulate him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Obama will follow suit "in coming days," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said that after previous elections Obama had waited a similar amount of time, holding off until Netanyahu was formally given the go-ahead to form a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Although Netanyahu must still put together a coalition, his victory all but guarantees Israel's president will give him the first opportunity to form a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Administration officials had privately signaled their hopes for an election outcome more in sync with Obama's agenda, especially with an end-of-March deadline looming for a framework nuclear deal in negotiations between Tehran and world powers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But they, and lawmakers, said U.S.-Israeli ties were strong enough to transcend their leaders' differences.</td></tr>
