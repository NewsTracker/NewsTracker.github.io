<h3>Ousted Egypt president starts latest trial on spying charge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The hearing was swiftly adjourned and a new date set for Feb. 28 after the court ruled that the defense should consult with Mohammed Morsi and the other 10 defendants in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutors say the other defendants are members of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood group, which propelled him to office in 2012 but was later banned after the army overthrew him a year later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I am the legitimate president... and this trial is a farce," said a defiant and sometimes smiling Morsi from the defendant's cage at the hearing, presided over by Judge Mohammed Shereen Fahmy at the Cairo Criminal Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The other defendants denied the charges, holding up four fingers in a gesture that has come to symbolize the Brotherhood's cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prosecutors allege that Morsi conspired with the other defendants to leak secret state documents, including military and security files, to Qatar - which had strongly supported Morsi's presidency and became a bitter rival to his military successors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The case hinges on allegations that the defendants conspired to hand deliver documents via national airline EgyptAir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A former EgyptAir cabin crew member is also in the dock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Morsi, overthrown in July 2013 following mass protests demanding his resignation, does not recognize the court, and insists Egypt's current leadership came to power in a coup d'etat and is thus illegitimate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Since then the government, now led by former army chief President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, has launched a sweeping crackdown on the Brotherhood and other political opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Morsi faces three other ongoing trials, on charges that include organizing jailbreaks, conspiring with foreign powers and inciting the killing of protesters - for which he could face the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was Egypt's first democratically elected leader, but his turbulent one-year rule left the country sharply divided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sissi's government has branded the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and has waged a fierce crackdown on it since Morsi's ouster.</td></tr>
