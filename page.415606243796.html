<h3>Leader of Greek far-right Golden Dawn freed from jail before trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, March 20 (Reuters) - The leader of Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party was released from prison on Friday and placed under house arrest as an 18-month limit on pre-trial detention expired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Golden Dawn leader Nikos Mihaloliakos and a more than a dozen party members were arrested on charges of founding and participating in a criminal group following the killing of an anti-fascism rapper in 2013 by a party supporter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The killing sparked nationwide protests and prompted a government-led crackdown on the fiercely anti-immigrant party, which entered parliament for the first time in 2012 by tapping into voter anger at Greece's economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Senior party members are among the 70 people due to go on trial on April 20, and face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mihaloliakos and senior lawmaker Yannis Lagos were both freed from Athens's high-security prison on Friday under the detention limit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Another senior lawmaker, Christos Pappas, is due to be released in the coming week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a statement issued on its website after the release of the two defendants, Golden Dawn denounced their detention as "illegal and unconstitutional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Golden Dawn did not buckle during the 18-month imprisonment of its leadership ... Golden Dawn will never buckle," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mihaloliakos will be placed under house arrest, while Lagos will be banned from taking part in public gatherings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both are forbidden to leave Greece, court officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The party denies the allegations against it and says it was the victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Among those due to go on trial are all the 16 lawmakers Golden Dawn had in the previous parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Thirteen of them, including Mihaloliakos, were re-elected to parliament on Jan. 25, along with four new members, making Golden Dawn the joint third largest party in the assembly.</td></tr>
