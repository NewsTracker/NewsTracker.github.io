<h3>Greste awaits Egypt&#039;s retrial verdict</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian journalist Peter Greste is nervously awaiting an Egyptian court's verdict on terrorism-related charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Egyptian court will decide on Thursday if Australian journalist Peter Greste will again be convicted of terrorism-related charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Greste's career as a foreign correspondent is on the line, as he awaits a verdict in a retrial that has been conducted without him in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The reporter was deported by Egypt in February, after 400 days behind bars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He and his two Al Jazeera colleagues had been serving seven to 10-year sentences for aiding a terrorist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They were found to have produced false news in support of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood group, which was declared a terrorist organisation after Morsi was ousted by the military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In January Egypt's highest court threw out the initial verdicts and ordered the men face a retrial, citing procedural flaws in the initial case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Mr Greste was deported before the retrial began on the orders of Morsi's successor Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Greste says he's anxious about Thursday's verdict because he couldn't return to Egypt to mount a defence without violating al-Sisi's order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He says a terrorism-related conviction would have a devastating effect on his career as a foreign correspondent, restricting his ability to travel to countries that have extradition arrangements with Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Even if things go against him on Thursday, it's unlikely he'll again endure the confines of an Egyptian prison cell because he's back on home soil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But that's not the case for his colleagues, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who are free on bail in Egypt awaiting the verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Greste said he hoped the court would accept that there was a complete absence of evidence to support the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If the court follows the evidence, we'll be fine," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"But I'm still deeply concerned about the prospect of a conviction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The men's initial trial was condemned by human rights groups as politically motivated and prompted the United Nations to question Egypt's judicial independence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop this month told her Egyptian counterpart that Mr Greste must be cleared of all charges and suffer no penalties that will hurt his career.</td></tr>
