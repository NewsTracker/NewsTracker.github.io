<h3>Defence Minister Kevin Andrews unable to name Islamic State leader</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Defence Minister Kevin Andrews was unable to name the leader of the Islamic State militant group in an embarrassing gaffe on the day the government committed additional troops to Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In an interview on ABC's 7.30 program on Tuesday night, Mr Andrews was asked repeatedly by host Leigh Sales to identify the Islamic State group's head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He repeatedly avoided answering directly, insisting that the leadership was complex and shifting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Defence Minister Kevin Andrews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This is partly true, however the Islamic State's leader is universally recognised as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has declared himself the Muslim world's caliph, is solely named leader by Islamic State supporters and is regarded as the leader by Western countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ms Sales initially asked: "Who is the top leader and what sort of focus is there on his capture?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Andrews first said there was a "cadre" of leaders of the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or Daesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite being asked four times, he was unable to name Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The gaffe came on the day that Mr Andrews and Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that the first of 330 additional Australian troops would leave this week for Iraq to train local forces in the fight against Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In making the announcement, Mr Abbott said Iraq was a "dangerous place" and the mission was not "risk free" though the troops will remain on a base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The US government has a $10 million bounty on Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While the self-declared caliph remains reclusive, he caused a significant stir when he appeared last July at a mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul to lead Friday prayer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After the interview, Mr Andrews told Fairfax Media: "Focussing on individuals ignores the threat that extremist organisations present. We remain firm in our resolve to defeat Daesh."</td></tr>
