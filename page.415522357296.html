<h3>Who is Robert Durst?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Robert Durst, 71, is a billionaire and subject of a recent HBO documentary who has been charged with murder in the 2000 death of his friend, Susan Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Robert Durst, an eccentric millionaire and star of an HBO series, is awaiting extradition to California on a murder charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He could face an additional weapons charge in Louisiana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But how much do we really know about Durst?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Durst was the only named suspect in the disappearance of his first wife, medical student Kathleen McCormack, who vanished in 1982.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The couple lived in Westchester County, north of New York City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>No charges were ever filed in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Eighteen years later, investigators looking into the McCormack disappearance contacted Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She was later found dead with a gunshot wound to the back of her head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>No one had been charged in her death until now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Months after Berman's death, Durst was arrested in the death of a Texas neighbor, Morris Black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Durst, who admitted cutting up Black's body and dumping the remains in Galveston Bay, won acquittal based on self-defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Self-defense?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A trio of Houston's highest paid defense attorneys - Dick DeGuerin, Chip Lewis and Mike Ramsey - won an acquittal based on self-defense that seemed to stun even Durst himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Durst family owns a sprawling real estate company, The Durst Organization, that was founded in 1915 by Joseph Durst, Robert Durst's grandfather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Leadership of the company passed on from Joseph to his son Seymour Durst, who expanded the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The multimillion dollar company currently owns several skyscrapers, including the Bank of America Tower in Manhattan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Both Robert and his brother Douglas joined the company, though Douglas was later chosen to head the company as chairman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After Robert's arrest, Douglas released a statement expressing gratitude to all who assisted in Durst's arrest and hoping that Robert "will finally be held accountable for all he has done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>How did his grandfather start the family business?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Durst Organization had humble beginnings in 1902 when, according to the corporation's website, Joseph Durst, a tailor from Gorlice, Austria (present-day Poland), arrived in the United States with $3 to his name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After a stint in the dressmaking business, he bought his first building in 1915.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The firm expanded quickly in the 1960s under his son Seymour, building a series of towers on Manhattan's Avenue of the Americas and creating the first building in the city that had a fully integrated heating and cooling system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>What is his relationship with his immediate family?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Durst has been at odds with his family for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>According to the New York Post, Durst has been permanently ostracized from his wealthy family - last year, he was arrested for trespassing on his brother Douglas' property on the West Side of Manhattan - and more than a dozen family members have taken out restraining orders against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Durst was arrested Saturday night for the 15-year-old murder of writer and Durst family friend Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Durst's case gained additional attention after the HBO documentary focusing on his life, The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, aired its sixth and final episode Sunday, ending its run with an over two-year- old clip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Durst can be heard mumbling to himself in a bathroom "What the hell did I do? Killed them all of course."</td></tr>
