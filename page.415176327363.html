<h3>Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu to address Congress ??live</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Point and counterpoint: Netanyahu and Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Guardian's diplomatic editor Julian Borger (@julianborger) offers one last assessment of Netanyahu's remarks today, looking at just how quickly could Iran militarize a nuclear arsenal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The claim: "[Virtually] all the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program will automatically expire in about a decade Iran would then be free to build a huge nuclear capacity that could product many, many nuclear bombs Iran's supreme leader says that Iran plans to have 190,000 centrifuges enriching uranium. With this massive capacity, Iran could make the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and this in a matter of weeks, once it makes that decision."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Julian's comment: "Any deal agreed in Geneva would have an expiry date, after which quantitative restrictions would be lifted, but it would probably not be automatic. Iran would have to fulfil a list of conditions to make that transition, or trigger a return of international sanctions, similar to the situation it faces today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Even after the period of the agreement, it would remain (unlike Israel) a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and to a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which involves constant monitoring aimed at insuring the nuclear programme is not used for military ends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Repurposing a huge number of centrifuges from making low enriched uranium to weapons-grade uranium, would be very complicated and would most likely take months to carry out effectively. The process of turning that material into usable warheads is also fraught with difficulty and requires nuclear tests to be confident weapons designs work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But in the context of the same kind of regime in Tehran and the same degree of volatility in the Middle East, it would mean a return to tension and uncertainty, once the agreement had lapsed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The bitter re-election campaign Netanyahu is waging in Israel may not be much affected by the theater of his speech in Washington, the Guardian's Peter Beaumont (@petersbeaumont) reports Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Reflecting the criticism of Obama and senior US officials, Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the US now running for office, conceded that while Netanyahu gave a "powerful" speech to he "did not offer any new ideas."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The criticism is bound to be amplified in coming days in what has been a bitterly contested election campaign - that Netanyahu risked damaging US-Israeli relations for no obvious benefit on the Iran question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Indeed, ahead of the speech an unnamed Israeli official traveling with Netanyahu had appeared to suggest that the Israeli prime minister would reveal damaging details of the US-led negotiations with Iran over it's nuclear programme, prompting warnings from some US officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In the end, however, Netanyahu's speech - while heavy on emotion and rhetorical devices - departed very little from the warnings he has delivered over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earnest now says that he thinks Congress tried to obviate the White House somewhat by inviting Netanyahu to speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I think what's clear is that Congress in arranging this speech tried to go around the executive branch. There is a role for Congress to play in foreign policy," Earnest says, but in this case members of Congress tried to "run around" the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The president will be able to make a very persuasive case that we can make a very good case that this is the best possible way to confront the threat from Iran's nuclear program. That if we know what's happening in Iran's nuclear program on a daily basis then we have resolved [the concerns of the international community]. Now we're going to have to be vigilant but if we do, we know that we're going to be able to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earlier today Obama said he would take the terms of a deal to Congress should they be finalized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Earnest says that Obama and Netanyahu are both thinking first of the security of their respective countries - not each other's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He adds that "the good news is those interests almost always align."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Netanyahu is "looking at this from a slightly different perspective," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Obama is "not focused on the politics or the theater, he's focused on ending the threat from Iran's" nuclear ambitions, White House press secretary Josh Earnest tells reporters who ask whether the president "disrespected" Netanyahu by not watching his speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"There was a lot of talk from prime minister Netanyahu criticizing and in some cases condemning a deal that hasn't been struck there will be ample opportunity for Congress and the American people to review [an agreement]," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"At that point we can have a discussion and maybe even a debate about whether or not the president is making the right judgment when he says this is the best way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Guardian's diplomatic editor Julian Borger (@julianborger) continues to check through Netanyahu's claims about Iran's nuclear program and the attendant negotiations around it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He checks here on the statement that Iran "refuses to come clean" about the military abilities of its program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The claim: "[The] IAEA said again yesterday that Iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program. Iran was also caught - caught twice, not once, twice - operating secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors didn't even know existed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Julian's comment: "The IAEA has said consistently that Iran has not resolved all its questions about the 'possible military dimensions' of the Iranian nuclear programme, almost all dating back to 2003 and earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"However, the IAEA questions do not represent certainty about that past weapons work. Some could be based on misleading intelligence. But Iran was indeed caught operating the Natanz enrichment plant in 2002-3, and the Qom underground site in 2009, without having told IAEA. Iran says it was not obliged to inform the agency. The IAEA disagrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The White House continues to describe Netanyahu's statements as unhelpful, with press secretary Josh Earnest saying that the prime minister's proposal of an alternative "better deal" is "not a plausible outcome".</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A reporter asks (paraphrasing): "Is Netanyahu imagining things by suggesting a world where this is possible?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Earnest: "It certainly is not a plausible outcome in the minds of the United States. What is a plausible outcome is an outcome that has Iran voluntarily rolling back key aspects that has Iran agreeing to a set of monitoring restrictions that would allow international experts routine and frequent access so they can confirm for themselves that Iran is living up to the agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Earnest says the US attitude is akin to that summaraized by national security advisor Susan Rice: "distrust and verify".</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He agrees with Netanyahu that Iran has given many reasons to distrust its promises, and that the US commitment to Israel has in no way changed or diminished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But he defends the proposed agreement with Iran, saying it would require "detailed verification that will includem, of course, as you would expect, the routine inspection of nuclear facilities in Iran, regular inspection of uranium mines," and inspection of attendant facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"We're talking about an in-depth, rigorous inspections regime that can verify through the international community that Iran is living up to their end of the deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Earnest says that the negotiations are working toward the outcome that "we can count on to best resolve our concerns. That's the best possible way to resolve the international community's concerns The alternative supported by prime minister Netanyahu and others falls far short of that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"The only X factor is whether Iran's going to sign onto an agreement that does all of those things."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>How does Netanyahu's claim about North Korea's nuclear violations stack up against his assertion that Iran has cheated similarly over the years?</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The view from the Guardian's diplomatic editor Julian Borger (@julianborger).</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The claim: "North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors. Within a few years, it got the bomb. Now, we're warned that within five years North Korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear bombs. Like North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors. It's done that on at least three separate occasions - 2005, 2006, 2010. Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Julian's comment: "North Korea did indeed stage a breakout, and could have a significant arsenal in five years. Iran did break the seals put in place by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 2005 (at a uranium conversion plant in Isfahan) and 2006 (at a uranium enrichment plant in Natanz).</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"In 2010, Iran took the IAEA by surprise by stepping up the level of enrichment from 3.5% to 20% without notice, though seals were not physically broken in the process. There are significant differences with the North Korea case, however. When Iran broke IAEA seals, it resumed activities which had civilian purposes, converting uranium to gas, and producing low-enriched and medium-enriched concentrations. It did not represent a breakout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"In the case of North Korea, there was no credible military deterrent to breaking out. The immediate neighbour, South Korea had no stomach for fight with its capital within easy range of Pyongyang's missiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"The strategic situation facing Iran is dramatically different. An Iranian breakout would almost certainly draw an rapid and devastating response from Israel, the US and the Gulf Arab states."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Are Iran and ISIS competing for the crown of militant Islam, as Netanyahu said they are?</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The Guardian's Middle East editor Ian Black casts some doubt on that assertion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>What Netanyahu said: "Iran and ISIS are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State. Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire. In this deadly game of thrones, there's no place for America or for Israel, no peace for Christians, Jews or Muslims who don't share the Islamist medieval creed, no rights for women, no freedom for anyone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The editor's analysis: not convincing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"The Israeli leader was on firmer ground with his description of the ambitions of Isis (aka the Islamic State) though he appeared to ignore evidence that it is becoming weaker in the face of shrinking revenues and a fightback by the US, Kurdish forces and four Arab states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"Isis is an extremist Sunni jihadi group which treats Shia Muslims (most Iranians) as apostates who can be killed. Iran seeks political and strategic influence and allies and uses proxies, especially Hizbullah in Lebanon and militias in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The theories floated by Netanyahu are "dated and wrong" in this case, he continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"But the idea that it is still 'exporting' the Islamic Revolution as it pledged to do after 1979, let alone seeking an 'empire', is dated and wrong. Iran's political system is dominated by a theocratic "supreme leader" yet it also has a parliament and regular elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>It is a repressive country and regularly uses the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>It broadly respects the rights of religious minorities including Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, though it persecutes the Bahai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei has also tweeted his hot take apropos prime minister Netanyahu's speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Netanyahu's main opponents have offered their reaction to the prime minister's speech - and they don't think much of it, reports the Guardian's Peter Beaumont (@petersbeaumont) in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Netanyahu's main challenger in the Israeli elections on 17 March, Zionist Union Yitzhak Herzog, was quick to play down the impact of the speech to Congress, arguing it would do nothing to interpose Israel in the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Speaking at an Israeli community close to the Gaza border, Herzog - who is marginally leading Netnayahu in the polls - said: "There is no doubt that Netanyahu is a good speaker. Let's be honest, the speech we heard today, as impressive as it was, did not stop the Iranian nuclear program."</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>"The question is not if the emerging nuclear deal is bad. The question is how do we prevent a bad deal," Herzog said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>"This speech is a very harsh wound to Israel-US relations," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>"It will not change the position of the administration and will only widen the rift with Israel's greatest ally and strategic partner."</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Zehava Gal-On, leader of the left wing Meretz party, had similar thoughts about the speech and claimed Netanyahu had made himself irrelevant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>"It's like David Cameron coming to the Knesset and telling Netanyahu that he is endangering the security of Israel," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>BBC Middle East editor Paul Danahar also stresses the importance of the speech in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>And another point of claim-checking of Netanyahu's statements, again from the Guardian's diplomatic editor Julian Borger (@julianborger).</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>The claim: "[I]f Iran's work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped, that break-out time could still be shorter, a lot shorter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Julian's comment: "This is not necessarily true. Any deal would frame Iran's permitted enrichment capacity in terms of 'separative work units', rather than number of centrifuges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>"So the more efficient the centrifuges, the fewer that would be allowed. Abruptly installing lots of experimental centrifuges in a hurry as part of a breakout scenario would be fraught with mishaps and glitches, if past experience is anything to go by.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>"Certainly, Iran could not be certain of achieving such a feat before the international community had time to respond militarily."</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>President Obama has dismissed Netanyahu's speech because "as far as I can tell there was nothing new," Reuters quotes him as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Obama said that a deal with Iran would cut off different pathways for the country to obtain weapons, the agency reports, and the deal would roll back parts of its program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>He also said that Netanyahu "did not offer any viable alternatives on preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Obama said he did not watch the speech but read a transcript of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>"Let's wait until there is actually a deal on the table that Iran has agreed to at which point everybody can evaluate it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Some more fact-checking of Netanyahu's statements regarding the proposed nuclear deal between western nations and Iran, courtesy the Guardian's diplomatic editor Julian Borger (@julianborger).</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>The claim: The agreement would leave Iran with a "vast nuclear infrastructure, providing it with a short break-out time to the bomb [Not] a single nuclear facility would be demolished. Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning. Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected, but not destroyed Iran's break-out time would be very short - about a year by US assessment, even shorter by Israel's."</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Julian's comment: "This is factually accurate but uses questionable adjectives. The most likely version of a deal would probably leave 4,000-10,000 centrifuges, and up to 15,000 left disconnected from a uranium gas supply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>"No facility would be destroyed, though the underground enrichment plant at Qom could be given a different purpose like research. The question of whether this represents a "vast" infrastructure is more debatable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>"As Netanyahu says, it gives Iran a breakout time (the period it would require to throw off international safeguards and monitoring and dash for a bomb) of a year. But supporters of the current diplomacy argue that is a significant length of time, more than enough to muster a coalition to inflict significant military damage on Iran's nuclear infrastructure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>House minority leader Nancy Pelosi was "near tears" throughout the entirety of Netanyahu's speech, she has said in a statement that awkwardly stretches between President Obama and the Israeli prime minister's positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>As one who values the US-Israel relationship, and loves Israel, I was near tears throughout the Prime Minister's speech - saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5+1 nations, and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>"Today, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated something we all agree upon: a nuclear armed Iran is unacceptable to both our countries. We have all said that a bad deal is worse than no deal, and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons is the bedrock of our foreign policy and national security. As President Obama has said consistently, all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear-armed Iran."</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Guardian diplomatic editor Julian Borger (@julianborger) is doing a bit of quick fact-checking of Netanyahu's assertions regarding the proposed nuclear deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>The claim: the deal currently on the table "will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Julian's comment: "The precise details of the deal being negotiated in Switzerland have not been made public, and key elements have yet to be agreed. However, it is true that the framework generally believed to be under discussion would not guarantee that Iran could never develop weapons, but no conceivable deal could deliver such a guarantee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>"Cheating is always a possibility. However, any agreement acceptable to the US and the five other major powers at the table would have to include significantly enhanced international monitoring of the Iranian nuclear programme, making it harder to cheat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>"Even after the expiry of the deal's lifetime, strict monitoring would remain in place. So there is a stronger argument to say that an agreement would make it harder for Iran to build a covert bomb."</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>"I thought it would be political theatre and it indeed it was worthy of an Oscar," Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, says of Netanyahu's speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>My colleague Dan Roberts (@robertsdan) is at the press conference being held by members of Congress who boycotted the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Privately some Democrats are concerned that the rhetorical punch could complicate the political battle to reach a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>"I thought it was a very effective speech as far as appealing to American people and Israeli people and helping moving his position in Congress," Cohen told the Guardian in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>"But I don't think it helps at all with the administration. I don't think it will move the needle there and might move the needle in the other direction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>Some of the members of Congress who skipped Netanyahu's speech are holding a press conference to explain why they snubbed the prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Washington state, accuses Netanyahu of scaremongering, in so many words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>In contrast, Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat from California, felt stirred throughout, the BBC's Julia Macfarlane tweets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>Republican Senator Rand Paul, meanwhile, a possible presidential contender whose foreign policy views skew toward non-intervention abroad, says simply that the speech "pleased" him and he'll continue to stand with Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Netanyahu adopted "a stylised version of the facts" about the nuclear negotiations with Iran, the Guardian's diplomatic editor, Julian Borger (@julianborger) writes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Binyamin Netanyahu's speech takes a stylised version of the facts underlying the nuclear negotiations currently underway with Iran, and casts them in a particularly menacing light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Elements of a potential deal which US and other western negotiators present as selling points - like the year-long breakout time that would be imposed on Iran, and the ten-plus years of the deal's lifetime - Netanyahu portrays as dangerously short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>Some facts and inferences are skewed, but mostly the speech represents a radically different take on the same reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>The most contentious passage does not involve the deal currently on the table, but its possible alternative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>The Israeli prime minister envisages more favourable terms, from a western perspective if greater pressure is applied on Tehran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Defenders of the current diplomacy argue that ripping up the deal now on the table and ratcheting up sanctions would have the opposite effect - triggering Iranian rejection of the significant constraints on its nuclear work, and an acceleration in the programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>That in turn could trigger an escalation in tensions leading to military action by Israel, the US or both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>Binyamin Netanyahu's description of Iran's "voracious appetite for aggression" and the claim that is "gobbling up four countries" were both to be expected in this context, but both are exaggerations that are designed to influence the course of the nuclear talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>The Israeli prime minister was on firmer ground with his attacks on Hizbullah, Tehran's loyal Lebanese ally and proxy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>The heart of his speech was the statement that Iran is a "genocidal enemy" of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>Iran's position and influence in the Middle East have certainly improved in the last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>It plays an important role in fighting Isis on the ground in Iraq and is a key player in Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>Its firm backing for Bashar al-Assad has been vital to his retention of control in Damascus and elsewhere in Syria, while continuing anti-government protests in Shia-majority Bahrain and the recent takeover by Houthi rebels in Yemen have all been to its advantage and discomfiting for the Saudis, Tehran's great regional rival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>Nor has Iran been quiet about its spate of victories in the region, although they too may be guilty of embellishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>Iran regularly boasts of these successes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>General Qasim Suleimani, head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, did just that in a recent speech on the anniversary of the Iranian revolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>But independent analysts say the Islamic Republic inflates its gains for propaganda purposes as well as for domestic consumption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>Netanyahu appeared to be doing something similar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>Iran's role in Bahrain, where the Shia majority remains locked in confrontation with the Saudi-backed Sunni monarchy, is more about scoring propaganda points than material support - despite claims in Manama about Iran's sinister role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>And in the heartlands of Iranian influence, Iraq and Syria, there have been significant costs as well as benefits, including the recent deaths of two senior Revolutionary Guards commanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>Sanctions and low oil prices - seen in Tehran as a deliberate strategy by the Saudis - has also made it harder to shell out billions of dollars to subsidize the Assad regime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>Senator Dianne Feinstein wonders about Netanyahu's pointed statement that Israel will "stand alone" if considers it necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>In Israel, supporters of Netanyahu are already spinning the prime minister's heroic reception to be used for ongoing re-election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>And online, some believe Netanyahu has made an egregious error by adopting a rather shallow reading of Robert Frost's 1920 poem "The Road Not Taken".</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu delivered what he said would be a "historic" speech to Congress today, railing against a proposed deal between the US, Iran and western nations over Tehran's nuclear ambitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>"Not a plan," is the simple take from David Axelrod, a former advisor to President Obama and a man with extraordinarily close ties to the administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>The quickest of takes are already coming in, but few seem to agree about whether Netanyahu's speech was a boom or a bust for President Obama and talks with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>Most simply agree that it sure was noisy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>From Richard Haass, president of the Council of Foreign Relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>"We are no longer scattered among the nations unable to defend ourselves and the soldiers who defend our home have boundless courage. For the first time in generations, we the Jewish people can defend ourselves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>"This is why as prime minister of Israel I can promise you one more thing. Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>129</td><td>"But I know that Israel does not stand alone, I know that America stands with Israel" - and here the cheers of the crowd rising to its feet drown out Netanyahu's voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>130</td><td>"You stand with Israel because you know that the story of Israel is not only the story of the Jewish people but of the human spirit that refuses again and again to succumb to history's horrors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>131</td><td>"Moses gave us a message that has steeled our resolve for thousands of years" - and here he ends by quoting Moses in Hebrew and English: "Be strong and resolute, neither fear nor dread."</td></tr>
<tr><td>132</td><td>"My friends, may Israel and the United States be strong and resolute, may we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead, may we face the future with confidence and hope. May God bless the state of Israel and may God bless the United States of America."</td></tr>
<tr><td>133</td><td>The chamber gets to its feet for one last voluminous round of applause, lasting well over a minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>134</td><td>It's just not true, he says, that "the only alternative to this deal is war."</td></tr>
<tr><td>135</td><td>"The alternative to this deal is a much better deal. A better deal that doesn't leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and such a short breakout point."</td></tr>
<tr><td>136</td><td>A deal, he says, that "won't give Iran an easy pass to the bomb. A better deal that Israel and its neighbors may not like, but with which we can live, literally. No country has a better stake than Israel in the [path] that peacefully removes this stuff."</td></tr>
<tr><td>137</td><td>We are on a "fateful crossroads," he continues: "We must now choose between two paths, one path leads to a bad deal, that will at best [delay] Iran's nuclear ambitions for a while, but will eventually lead to a nuclear-armed Iran whose unabated aggression will lead to a war."</td></tr>
<tr><td>138</td><td>"You don't have to read Robert Frost," Netanyahu says, to know about the importance of the path less taken - an allusion to a poem by the New England poet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>139</td><td>Netanyahu now points out a Holocaust survivor to the chamber, saying that his presence gives special "meaning to the words 'never again'".</td></tr>
<tr><td>140</td><td>Netanyahu says he does know one thing for sure: "The days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of [enemies] - those days are over."</td></tr>
<tr><td>141</td><td>"If Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions shuld be lifted. If Iran does not change its behavior, the restrictions should not lifted. If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country!</td></tr>
<tr><td>142</td><td>"My friends, what about the argument that there is no alternative to this deal? That Iran's nuclear know-how cannot be erased that the best you can do is delay the inevitable. Well that nuclear know-how without infrastructure doesn't get you very far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>143</td><td>"A race car driver without a car can't go very far."</td></tr>
<tr><td>144</td><td>He argues that destroying the infrastructure is a necessary step.</td></tr>
<tr><td>145</td><td>"My friends, we've been told for over a year that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well this is a bad deal, a very bad deal. We're better off without it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>146</td><td>Netanyahu keeps going, periodically interrupted by applause: "Israel's neighbors, Iran's neighbors, know that Iran will become even more aggressive when [it is] unshackled."</td></tr>
<tr><td>147</td><td>"So this deal won't change Iran for the better, it will only change the Middle East for the worst. It will then spark a nuclear arms race It won't be a farewell to arms, it will be a farewell to arms control! And the middle east will soon be crisscrossed with nuclear tripwire."</td></tr>
<tr><td>148</td><td>"First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second, stop supporting terrorism around the world. And third, stop threatening to annihilate my country Israel!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>149</td><td>Netanyau says that Iran's ballistic missile systems would make it able to target "every part of the United States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>150</td><td>He says that the proposed deal leaves two major concessions: "one, leaving Iran with a vast nuclear program; and two, lifting the restrictions on the program in about a decade."</td></tr>
<tr><td>151</td><td>"That's why this deal is so bad. It doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb. it paves Iran's path to the bomb. So why would anyone make this deal? Because they believe Iran will change in the coming years? Because they [don't see a better choice]?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>152</td><td>"I don't believe that Iran's radical regime will change fro the better after this deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>153</td><td>"If Iran is gobbling up four countries right now, how many more countries would Iran devour with its sanctions lifted? Would Iran fund less terrorism?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>154</td><td>"Why should it change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both worlds, aggression abroad and prosperity at home? This is a question that everyone asks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>155</td><td>Netanyahu is now criticizing the nuclear negotiations, saying that the agreement would provide Iran "with a short breakout time for a bomb."</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>"According to the deal not a single [facility] would be demolished" he says, and "because Iran's [facilities] would be left largely intact, Iran's breakout time would be very short."</td></tr>
<tr><td>157</td><td>"True, certain restrictions would be imposed on Iran's nuclear program, and Iran's adherence to those restrictions would be [monitored by international inspectors]."</td></tr>
<tr><td>158</td><td>"Inspectors document those restrictions, they don't stop them."</td></tr>
