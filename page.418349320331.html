<h3>Opinion: Why 'Grexit' could be good for Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It is a shame that Greece was unable to manage its finances and is now slipping into chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But this outcome was inevitable and could not be permanently averted with loans from the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Greek government was effectively bankrupt back in 2012, in what was the biggest state insolvency to date, with write-downs worth 105 billion euros ($115 billion) by private creditors and a rescheduling of public sector debt equivalent to a 43 billion euro ($47 billion) write-down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Despite the debt relief, everything continued to go downhill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While the economy shrank, Greek government debt grew, fueled by Greece's large trade deficits and obvious lack of competitiveness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The country had become uncompetitive in the inflationary credit bubble that the euro had brought upon the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Inside the euro, Greek unemployment hit 25%, while youth unemployment soared to 50%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 330 billion euros ($361 billion), or 185% of Greece's GDP, that the international community lent the country was unable to improve these figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As problematic as events in Greece may be, government insolvency is not an unusual occurrence in Greece, or indeed in the global community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This is Greece's sixth insolvency in the last 200 years, and its second in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The global community, meanwhile, has experienced over 180 such state insolvencies since World War II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Insolvencies are painful, but they can be liberating for debtors, who at least get to clear some of their debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And if sovereign insolvency is linked to a currency devaluation, it may kick start the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The study of 71 currency crises since 1980 that were followed by devaluation shows that growth normally resumes rather quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For about one year after the depreciation, countries on average experience a lower growth rate than in the pre-crisis period, but then the economy starts to perk up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After two years, growth tends to have returned to pre-crisis levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>These are the findings of a report by the Ifo Institute conducted in 2012, which were backed up by a study published by Oxford Economics this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Even Argentina managed to get back on track fast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Many baseless arguments have been put forward about the difficulties a "Grexit" would bring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They include the assertion that the country would sustain heavy damage because it would be cut off from financial markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>This statement not only overlooks the fact that access to markets would be forfeited by Greece's insolvency, and not by exiting the euro; it also fails to recognize that Greece would temporarily no longer need access to markets following an exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>According to Greek figures, the state is already showing a primary budget surplus, and the trade deficit will disappear after a devaluation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If Greece decides no longer to service its foreign debt, it will not require any fresh loans after a devaluation of its new currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Another untenable argument is that the Greek economy would not stand to gain from a weaker currency because it barely exports anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Firstly, it is not true that Greece does not export anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tourist services and building materials will play a significant role in this respect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Secondly, the main advantage of the devaluation is that Greek citizens would now have to turn to domestic producers, because imports will be too expensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This will revive the economy, including agriculture, which is currently suffering from the fact that the country imports 23% more agricultural products than it exports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The fear that an exit would lead to capital flight is also absolutely unfounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Naturally there is capital flight prior to the devaluation due to fears of asset losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Once the devaluation has taken place, however, the reverse effect will occur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Capital will start to flow back and investors will buy property, followed by investment in renovating those properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>This will generate a great deal of construction activity as, for example, in Italy after the 1992 depreciation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Seen in these terms, fear of a "Grexit" is unfounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>While the state insolvency creates chaos, an exit offers the opportunity to overcome that chaos.</td></tr>
