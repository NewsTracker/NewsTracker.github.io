<h3>Jordan Spieth, 21, captures Masters victory for the ages (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>AUGUSTA, Ga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Jordan Spieth got more than redemption and a green jacket Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He took his place among the best in the game with a Masters victory for the ages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One year after Spieth lost a bid to become the youngest Masters champion, the 21-year-old Texan turned in one of the most dominant wins ever at Augusta National.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He never let anyone get closer to him than three shots after his record start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He never gave anyone much hope on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Spieth closed with a 2-under 70, missing a 5-foot par putt on the final hole that would have set yet another record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Instead, he tied the score set by Tiger Woods in 1997 at 18-under 270.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''This was the ultimate goal in my golf life,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For all the talk about the Grand Slam bid by Rory McIlroy and the return of Woods, this week was about the arrival of another star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''It's awfully impressive,'' McIlroy said after finishing fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''It's nice to get your major tally up and running at an early stage in your career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Spieth became the first wire-to-wire winner at the Masters since Raymond Floyd in 1976, and this might have been even more special.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Craig Woods in 1941 is the only other Masters champion who led by at least three shots from the opening round to the trophy presentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Phil Mickelson tried to make a run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>So did Justin Rose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Neither got closer than three shots at any point, and it wasn't long before Spieth was making another birdie putt to take the drama out of the back nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mickelson (69) and Rose (70) tied for second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It was the 10th time Mickelson has been runner-up in a major.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Woods jarred his right wrist then he struck wood under the pine straw on the ninth hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He recovered and closed with a 73, 13 shots behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Spieth won for the third time on the PGA Tour and fifth time worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He will rise to No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>2 in the world rankings, still a ways to go to catch McIlroy at the top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>When McIlroy won back-to-back majors last year to establish himself as the game's best player, the quest was to find a rival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Spieth provided the answer on perhaps the biggest stage in the sport with his record-setting week at Augusta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''I thought today might be easier having played with the lead on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It wasn't,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''It's the most incredible week of my life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>This is as great as it gets in our sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>And he will keep the editors of the Masters record book busy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>- The 36-hole record at 14-under 130.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>- The 54-hole record at 16-under 200.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>- The most birdies for the tournament at 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>- The lowest opening round by a champion at 64.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>- The youngest player to lead after the opening round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''He has no weaknesses,'' Mickelson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>''He doesn't overpower the golf course, but he plays the course strategically well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He plays all the shots properly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>And he has that ability to focus and see things clear when the pressure is on and perform at his best when the pressure is on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Spieth showed early he was up to challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Rose, starting the final round four shots behind, rolled in a 10-foot birdie putt on the first hole, and Spieth calmly made his birdie putt from just inside him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Spieth went out in 35 to build his lead to five shots, and one putt later, the Masters effectively was over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Spieth rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt on No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>10 for a six-shot lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>It was his 26th birdie of the Masters, breaking the tournament record that Mickelson set in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Spieth managed this in only 64 holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The next target was the 72-hole scoring record that Woods set in 1997 and he almost got there except for that bogey at the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>He twice went for the green on par 5s on the back nine, barely clearing the creek at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>13 and going just over the back on No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>15, both times making birdie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The birdie on the 15th made him the only player in Masters history to reach 19-under par.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>McIlroy had a 68-66 weekend, hurt by his slow start and put him 12 shots going into the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>He will have to wait until next year to try to win the Masters and become the sixth player to complete the career Grand Slam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The way Spieth is playing, that task just got a little harder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>In his last four starts, Spieth has won twice and finished second twice.</td></tr>
