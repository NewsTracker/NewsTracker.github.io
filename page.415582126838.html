<h3>Syracuse?s Jim Boeheim Says Penalties Are ?Unduly Harsh?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Answering questions in the Carrier Dome for more than an hour Thursday morning, a defiant Mr. Boeheim denied the N.C.A.A.'s assertions that his program had spun out of control and argued that the punishment - including a nine-game suspension for Mr. Boeheim to be served at the start of conference play next season - did not fit the alleged infractions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"This is far from a program where student-athletes freely committed academic fraud," Mr. Boeheim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr. Boeheim, 70, said he planned to file an appeal Friday against some of the penalties, which also included reducing 12 scholarships over the next four years and vacating 108 wins since 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Wednesday, the university announced that Mr. Boeheim, who had been second in career Division I wins with 966 before the infractions were announced, would coach for three more seasons, and that the athletic director, Daryl Gross, had resigned, although he will remain at the university as a special assistant to the chancellor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr. Boeheim offered his apologies for how the investigation had affected his program, which imposed a postseason ban on itself for this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Ultimately, as head coach, I must also accept responsibility for the conduct of individuals within the program," Mr. Boeheim said, "including those found to have committed violations of N.C.A.A. rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I do regret that these violations happened," he added, "and I apologize for any harm it has brought to my players or the university, and any embarrassment it has caused to our alumni, students and fans."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr. Boeheim said three years was longer than he had planned to continue coaching, and he indicated that he had considered retiring after Syracuse reached the Final Four in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But he did not want to leave the Orange amid a lengthy investigation, he said, and he did not want to abandon the program now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I believe three years is right for me to be able to do my job as best as I can," Mr. Boeheim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I believe the program will be in a great position when I retire."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr. Boeheim maintained that he had no personal involvement in the alleged infractions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He lamented that his side of the story had been "disregarded by enforcement staff," and that he was not asked to interview with the N.C.A.A. a second time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His remarks veered when he spoke about the former player Fab Melo, who was one of the main subjects of the N.C.A.A.'s investigation into academic misconduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At one point, he implied that the focus on Mr. Melo as an at-risk student from Brazil was biased and that Mr. Melo had been unfairly portrayed as a student who was unable to do the work because he was a foreign student.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I think there's a little racism involved," Mr. Boeheim said, "when they start talking about not taking this guy or that guy. He's from a foreign country. We shouldn't have foreign students at Syracuse?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>According to the N.C.A.A., Mr. Gross convened a meeting with members of the athletic department, as well as the faculty athletic representative and an associate provost, in January 2012 to strategize a way to get Mr. Melo back on the court after he had been declared academically ineligible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The group settled on a plan to get a grade in one of Mr. Melo's previous courses changed, according to the N.C.A.A. A former director of basketball operations, Stan Kissel, was asked to assist Mr. Melo in making this happen, and he did, providing text, research and citations to the "extra work" that Mr. Melo submitted to a course he had taken the previous year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr. Boeheim said those efforts were undertaken without his knowledge or consent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said, "This was not my way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2015, on page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Boeheim Defends Penalized Program.</td></tr>

<h3>Netanyahu backtracks from opposition to Palestinian state</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Days after winning re-election, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday backtracked from hard-line statements against the establishment of a Palestinian state in an apparent effort to contain a diplomatic backlash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the closing days of his campaign, Netanyahu said there could be no Palestinian state while regional violence and chaos persist - conditions that could rule out progress on the issue for many years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The comments, aimed at appealing to his nationalistic voter base, angered the Obama administration, which views a two-state solution as a top foreign policy priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu said in a TV interview Thursday that he remains committed to Palestinian statehood - if conditions in the region improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said he remained committed to the vision first spelled out in landmark 2009 speech at Israel's Bar Ilan University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I haven't changed my policy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I never retracted my speech."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At the time, Netanyahu said he would agree to a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes Israel as the Jewish homeland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to offer such recognition, and last year formed a unity government backed by the Hamas militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hamas is sworn to Israel's destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the interview, Netanyahu also pointed to the presence of hostile Islamic groups across the region and said that any captured territory handed over to Abbas would be taken over by militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, shortly after Israeli withdrew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I don't want a one state solution, I want a sustainable peaceful two state solution but for that circumstances have to change," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"And every territory that is vacated in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A day before the election Netanyahu told the nrg news website that a Palestinian state would not be established on his watch because of the current climate in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Whoever ignores that is burying his head in the sand. The left is doing that, burying its head in the sand time after time," he said in the video interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>When asked if that means a Palestinian state will not be established if he is elected, Netanyahu replied, "Indeed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The remarks drew heavy criticism from Washington, which said Wednesday that it was re-evaluating its options after Netanyahu's hard-line comments.</td></tr>
