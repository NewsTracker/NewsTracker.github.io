<h3>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano eruption sends lava, rocks and gas into the air as crater wall collapses</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Molten lava, rocks and gas went flying through the air on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano after an explosion was caused by the partial collapse of a crater wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The collapse triggered a small explosion, spreading lava and debris around the rim of Kilauea's Halemaumau Crater, the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Janet Babb, a geologist with the USGS, compared the blast on Sunday to taking a hammer to the top of a bottle of champagne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'You look at the bottle and you see the liquid, but you don't see the gas,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'There's a lot of gas in the lava.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rocks overhanging the lava lake are altered by gases coming from the lava, Babb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The rocks eventually give way and collapse into the lava, causing an explosion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The material was hurled about 280 feet skyward, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Video of the event shows a wall of rocks sliding into a lava lake that last week rose to a record-high level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The lava lake overflowed several times during the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, the recent rising lava levels at the the u Crater mark the first time a lava lake has been visible from the national park visitor overlook in over 40 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>What's more, geologists have noted that the lava lake could continue to overflow, causing more instances like the one that occurred on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'As long as magma supply is elevated, we expect continued high lava lake levels accompanied by additional overflows,' one observatory scientist noted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The slide caused an explosion that sent fist-size chunks of rock onto the closed Halemaumau visitor overlook, according to the Geological Survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The area has been closed since 2008, when the lava lake formed, and no one was injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There could be fallout of ash and dust from this type of event, but it's very unlikely that anyone could be injured, Babb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Wind direction dictates the amount of debris that lands in visitor areas, and it is relatively common, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The last time molten lava was visible in the crater was in 1982, when a fissure erupted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The last time there was a lake similar to this one was in 1974.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The vent within Halemaumau Crater has been rising and falling since it first opened, but it reached a record high last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Even at its previous highest level in October 2012, the lake was too low for people to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>During the day, people could view the gas rising from the lake, and at night people could see the orange glow from the lava.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>From the early 1800s up until 1924, there was a continuous lake of lava at Kilauea summit within Halemaumau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>At that time, the crater was about half the diameter of what it is now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In 1924, there was a huge eruption inside the volcano that doubled the size of the crater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Since 1924, lava lakes have been present at different times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In 1967 and 1968, the entire crater was filled with molten lava.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>You can still see a 'bathtub ring' on the walls of the crater where the lava had risen to at that time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A magnitude 3.6 earthquake was felt in the area early Monday morning, according to the Geological Survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Molten lava was last visible at the Kilauea location in 1982 when a fissure erupted.</td></tr>
