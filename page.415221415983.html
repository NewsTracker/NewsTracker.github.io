<h3>IPhone 6's popularity drives Apple's China share to record</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kantar Worldpanel ComTech said Thursday that its latest survey of 15,000 people living in Chinese cities showed Apple's market share reached 25.4 percent in the November-January period, up from 20.9 percent a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That was a record for Apple in the world's largest smartphone market, but not enough to catch up Chinese maker Xiaomi, which claimed 27.6 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The research firm said the market share of Samsung Electronics Co. eroded further to 11.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was 22.2 percent a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kantar conducts a monthly online survey of the same 15,000 city-dwelling Chinese who are 16 years or older.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Its latest consumer survey sheds more light on the smartphone market in China amid differing figures from market research companies about which manufacturer came out on top after intense competition in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>IHS said Xiaomi was the top seller in China last year followed by Samsung Electronics with 15 percent and 14 percent market shares respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But another research firm Canalys said Apple was the winner for the first time in the last quarter of 2014, followed by Xiaomi and Samsung.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Although the rankings may differ, all the research reflects similar trends: Apple is on the rise in China boosted by iPhone 6 sales and Samsung is likely the biggest loser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at Kantar, said the iPhone 6, released in October, was the best-selling smartphone model in China in the November-January period followed by Xiaomi's RedMi Note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tamsin Timpson, the research company's strategic insight director, said Samsung's China market share was at its lowest level since the company began its smartphone consumer survey in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Samsung Electronics unveiled the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge on Sunday, part of the company's efforts to improve phone design and reclaim ground lost to Apple and Xiaomi.</td></tr>

<h3>Russia starts large-scale military exercises in disputed territories</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The exercises involve over 2,000 anti-aircraft troops and 500 items of weaponry and will last until April 10, Interfax news agency reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Defence Ministry said the exercises were taking place in Russia's Southern and North Caucasus Federal Districts, as well as on Russian military bases in Armenia, the Georgian separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Ukraine's Crimea region, which Moscow annexed last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They are likely to be viewed in the West as a show of force as relations between Russia and the West are at their most strained since the Cold War because of the Ukraine crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of directing a separatist assault in eastern Ukraine with its own troops and weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russia has repeatedly denied those accusations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At a news conference in Moscow unrelated to the exercises, Russian Deputy Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov said NATO activities on Russia's borders far exceeded anything the Russian military was undertaking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"NATO states are using the situation in the south-east of Ukraine as an excuse to ... move forward, closer to Russia's borders," Interfax quoted Antonov as saying.</td></tr>
