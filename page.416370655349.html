<h3>Aust to close Ebola treatment centre</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australia will close its Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone by the end of April, returning $7.5 million to an emergency humanitarian fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the decision was made because the number of new infections was decreasing and there were now more beds available for treatment than patients in the west African country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Since opening December 2014 the Australian-funded centre admitted 216 patients, 36 were treated successfully while a further 120 tested negative for Ebola.</td></tr>
