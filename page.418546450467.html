<h3>MH17 anniversary: In Russia, conspiracy theories on downed plane still find believers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Last August Martin Parker, Professor of Organisation and Culture at University of Leicester, wrote that conspiracy theories such as those surrounding MH17 and MH370 (which disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014) are a symptom of our "surge to order", our desire to see patterns rather than accept mysteries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They are also hard to dismiss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If you attempt to correct a conspiracy theorist, in their eyes you have become a deluded victim or, worse, a member of the conspiracy - proving its existence by the act of denying it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This can be the only explanation for one of the craziest theories: the one about MH17 really being MH370, rebadged and loaded with explosives and dead bodies.</td></tr>
