<h3>New Mexico AG: Uber, Lyft drivers need drug testing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas says drivers of ride-booking services Lyft and Uber in the state should face drug testing requirements like taxi drivers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Balderas sent state regulators a letter Wednesday and asked them to strengthen public safety standards around ride-booking services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Last week, the state's Public Regulation Commission voted 4-1 on new regulations clearing way for the companies to function under guidelines separate from those that govern traditional taxi services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But drug testing requirements were dropped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The San Francisco-based Lyft and Uber use smartphone programs to connect people seeking rides with people who have cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Both had been operating in New Mexico despite complaints for taxi companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Spokeswomen for Lyft and Uber did not immediately return emails from The Associated Press.</td></tr>
