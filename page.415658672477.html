<h3>Trice leads Michigan State over Virginia again 60-54 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 6-foot, 175-pound Trice scored 13 of his team's first 15 points on 5-of-5 shooting, including three 3-pointers, to help the Spartans build a 15-4 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Branden Dawson added 15 points and nine rebounds for the seventh-seeded Spartans, who advanced to the Sweet 16 for the seventh time in the last eight seasons under coach Tom Izzo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Spartans will play the winner of the Oklahoma-Dayton game in Syracuse, New York on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''Our thing was attack from the get go and get a lead,'' said Trice, in his first full season as a starter after three years as a reserve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It was his time to shine,'' said Dawson, who started playing with Trice in AAU ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With top seed Villanova having lost Saturday, it is the first time a No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>1 and 2 seed from the same region didn't advance to the Sweet 16 since Kentucky and Gonzaga in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Cavaliers (30-4), the first Atlantic Coast Conference team to lose after a 9-0 start in the tournament, were led by Anthony Gill's 11 points and Darion Atkins' 10 points and 14 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Izzo made some defensive tweaks to his game plan after Michigan State's first-round win over Georgia, and the Spartans (25-11) stole a page from last year's regional semifinal win by limiting the Cavaliers to 29.8 percent shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Virginia finished 2 of 17 from 3-point range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Izzo said the Spartans ''changed what we do'' defensively in a day-and-a-half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Instead of having his guards jump to the ball and give help, Izzo relied more on his big men in the middle to stay disciplined - and not cheat or go for steals - and guard against Virginia's flare screens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''We're just not as talented as we've been so we are always cheating to find a way to get an edge,'' Izzo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''Coaches can tell you what to do, but when muscle memory tells you to do it another way ... your focus has to be incredible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Last year, the Spartans upset the top-seeded Cavaliers in the regional semifinal by holding Virginia to 35.1 percent shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>While Trice was beating them up and down the court and making 3s, the Cavaliers opened the game 2 of 10 from the field and could never get on track offensively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''They are so good defensively that any start like that is costly,'' Cavaliers coach Tony Bennett said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Cavaliers finished the first half shooting just 26.7 percent (8 of 30) from the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Virginia cut the lead to two to start the second half behind two quick baskets by Justin Anderson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But the Spartans countered with a 12-2 run led by Dawson, who had seven points during the stretch, including a three-point play off a fastbreak dunk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Down six points, Atkins picked up his fourth foul with 8:36 left on what replays showed to be a clean block on Gavin Schilling and was forced to go to the bench, which served to be a momentum swing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Virginia would battle back to within five after Atkins returned to the game, but Trice knocked down a clutch 28-footer with 1 second left on the shot clock to put the Spartans up 52-44 with 3 minutes to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''That was a dagger 3,'' Bennett said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''It was an NBA 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It wasn't exactly the play Izzo wanted, but he said sometimes good players improvise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''It was one of those, 'Oh no... Nice shot,' type of deals,' Izzo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Michigan State: Won despite shooting 20 of 33 from the free throw line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>... Led for more than 38 minutes of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Virginia: Outrebounded Michigan State 39-32.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>... Finished 18 of 26 from the free throw line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>... London Perrantes and Anderson were a combined 4 of 17 from the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Virginia finished with its second straight 30-win season, a school record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But the Cavaliers fell earlier than expected once again in the NCAA Tournament despite spending most of the season ranked in the top five in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''It just leaves that feeling that you wish you could have taken it further,'' Bennett said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''But it doesn't take away when all the dust settles what was accomplished, and we give thanks for that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Michigan State: Will advance to the Sweet 16 to play the Oklahoma-Dayton winner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Virginia: Season over.</td></tr>
