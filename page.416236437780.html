<h3>NYC mayor draws some ire for not endorsing Clinton campaign</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>President Bill Clinton's administration appointed de Blasio in the 1990s to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton elevated de Blasio to be campaign manager of her 2000 U.S. Senate bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And both Clintons appeared at de Blasio's inauguration as New York City mayor and have supported his agenda, both publicly and privately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With that history as the backdrop, the mayor made an appearance Sunday on "Meet the Press" in the hours before Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy for president, and he raised eyebrows across the political world by declining to endorse his former boss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton is so far not expected to face a major challenger for the Democratic nomination, though some lower-profile party members are contemplating entering the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>De Blasio, a Democrat more liberal than Clinton on most issues, said he would withhold his blessing "until I see an actual vision of where they want to go."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hilary Rosen, a Clinton ally, wrote on Twitter: "@BilldeBlasio's self aggrandizing on #MeetthePress at @hillaryclintons expense won't go unnoticed. #Ridiculous."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And as other New York politicians " including Gov. Andrew Cuomo and its U.S. senators " quickly endorsed Clinton, both city tabloids ripped the mayor on their front pages, going with the headlines "Hil's Fury" and "Traitor" (New York Post) and "Stabbed in de Back" (New York Daily News).</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Much of the criticism suggested that de Blasio " who has been widely expected to be an active campaigner for the former secretary of state " was being ungrateful to the Clintons and used the "Meet the Press" appearance to bolster his own national profile at the expense of his former boss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I think it's really problematic that it came off like it was all about him," said Jeanne Zaino, political science professor at Iona College.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"His own political future " not hers, not the good of the party " seemed to matter most."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>De Blasio has made no secret of his efforts to become a leading voice for the ultraliberal wing of the Democratic Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He has taken steps to raise his profile, including making a bid for the 2016 Democratic National Convention, where the presidential nominee is formally picked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some political observers believe that de Blasio's reluctance to immediately offer his endorsement was calculated and clever, increasing the value of it in the months ahead and potentially getting Clinton to move to the left on some issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It also, according to veteran political strategist Hank Sheinkopf, might actually increase the potency of his support down the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"De Blasio is setting himself up as the progressive seal of approval and that means that any candidate he blesses checks all the right liberal boxes," Sheinkopf said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"So, when he's eventually out there campaigning for her " which of course he will be " he acts as a barrier to any attacks from the left."</td></tr>
