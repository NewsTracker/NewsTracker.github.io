<h3>Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim to retire in 3 years; AD out</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chancellor Kent Syverud said Wednesday, March 18, 2015, that Boeheim, a Hall of Famer and head coach for 39 years, decided to make the announcement to "bring certainty to the team and program in the coming years" and to allow for a smooth transition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Jim Boeheim became the face of Syracuse University over the past five decades, first as player, then as coach - revered for wins and delivering a national title to a struggling city in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the coda to his decorated career has become tinged with undeniable blemishes, laid out in harsh penalties for violations the NCAA says show Boeheim and the university lost control of athletics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Boeheim and Syracuse officials acknowledged the unwanted ties Wednesday in announcing he will retire after three more seasons, while insisting they don't agree with parts of the scathing NCAA report and will appeal to try to save scholarships and wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Syracuse University Chancellor Kent Syverud said Boeheim decided to make the announcement to "bring certainty to the team and program in the coming years" and to allow for a smooth transition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Coach Jim Boeheim has been a mainstay at Syracuse University for more than one-third of our entire 144-year history," Syverud said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He enrolled as a student here in 1962 and has never left. He has been the embodiment of Orange pride."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When Boeheim turned 70 in November, wife Juli asked him if he was OK with coaching as a septuagenarian and all that goes along with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I just think one day you're going to have to slow down," Juli said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He doesn't want to, number one, and he feels better than he ever has."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The violations, lasting more than a decade under Boeheim's watch, involved academic misconduct, extra benefits and the university's drug-testing policy, according to a March 6 report by the NCAA Committee on Infractions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Boeheim is already suspended for the first half of the next Atlantic Coast Conference season, a total of nine games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Syracuse will also have three scholarships taken away for four seasons and all wins vacated in which an ineligible player participated during five seasons between 2004 and 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The total wins removed from records could be as high as 108, depending on what happens in the appeal process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Syracuse has already vacated 24 wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Athletic director Daryl Gross is also stepping aside, immediately taking another marketing position with the school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Pete Sala will serve as interim athletic director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Boeheim, who scheduled a news conference for Thursday, has had problems before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The NCAA banned the Orange from the 1993 NCAA Tournament for recruiting violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Longtime assistant coach Mike Hopkins, a former star for the Orange, is in line to succeed Boeheim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In its report, the NCAA placed Syracuse on probation for five years for breaking with the "most fundamental core values of the NCAA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Athletic department officials interfered with academics, making sure star players stayed eligible, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The report said the former director of basketball operations, who was picked by Boeheim and whose job primarily consisted of monitoring academic performance of basketball student-athletes, became overly involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He collected and maintained student-athletes' usernames and passwords and provided them to others, including student-athlete support services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Members of the support staff routinely accessed and sent emails from student-athletes' accounts and corresponded directly with professors and included attached course work to maintain the required grades for the student-athletes to remain eligible, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The 94-page report also said basketball staff encouraged students to develop relationships with a booster, which led to rule violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The booster provided more than $8,000 to three football and two men's basketball students for volunteering at a local YMCA, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Additionally, the booster gave money to basketball staff for appearances or assistance at YMCA events, payments that weren't reported to the school as outside income or supplemental pay, as NCAA rules require.</td></tr>

<h3>Netanyahu surges to victory in Israeli vote</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>While the tough talk gave Netanyahu a last-minute boost in the polls, the Israeli leader could now face a difficult task convincing an already skeptical world that he is serious about reaching peace with his Arab neighbors - particularly if, as expected, he forms a new government comprised of religious and nationalistic parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Trailing in opinion polls, Netanyahu took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign to shore up support among his core nationalistic constituency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He vowed to increase settlement construction in east Jerusalem, the Palestinians' would-be capital, and rejected the idea of a Palestinian state in current conditions - putting him at odds with U.S. and European positions and reversing his own policy of the past six years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a last-ditch attempt to spur his supporters to the polls Tuesday, he warned that Arab citizens were voting "in droves" and endangering years of rule by his Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The comments drew accusations of racism from Israeli Arabs and a White House rebuke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In Washington, the Obama administration said Wednesday that it was "deeply concerned" by the divisive language used by the Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest also said the U.S. would have to rethink the best way to bring about a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - a cornerstone of U.S. Mideast policy for years - after Netanyahu rejected the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Based on those comments, the U.S. will evaluate our position going forward," Earnest told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One on a flight to Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said Secretary of State John Kerry had called Netanyahu to congratulate him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But she refused to describe the conversation as "warm" or friendly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu's controversial stance appears to have paid off at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thought to be in danger of being voted out of office just a few days ago, the Likud emerged as the largest party in parliament when near-final results trickled in Wednesday, leaving it in position to lead the next coalition government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the comments may have reinforced a belief in many world capitals that Netanyahu isn't serious about peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dore Gold, a confidant and unofficial adviser to Netanyahu, said he was confident the prime minister could repair the relationship with the U.S., Israel's closest and most important ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The U.S. and Israel have had very sharp disagreements in the past about different aspects of Mideast policy but have usually been able to overcome the differences," Gold said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I suspect that is exactly what is going to happen this time as well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Gold declined to speculate on what Netanyahu might do, saying only that he is a masterful diplomat who knows "exactly how to address the U.S.-Israel relationship in a positive way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Elliot Abrams, a former adviser on Mideast policy to President George W. Bush, dismissed Netanyahu's campaign tactics as "hot rhetoric."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I'm not sure they give us much insight into how he's going to govern," Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, told a briefing for reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Likud led the election by capturing 30 seats in the 120-member parliament, according to near-final results released Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Netanyahu is expected to cobble together a majority coalition in the coming weeks made up of religious and nationalist parties that generally oppose concessions toward the Palestinians, and a new centrist party whose agenda is focused almost entirely on domestic economic matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The issue of the Palestinians is not expected to be high on the agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Cabinet minister Yuval Steinitz, a close ally of Netanyahu's, said withdrawing from captured land to make way for a Palestinian state "is not relevant" in the current climate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said Israel believes any land it relinquishes to the Palestinians will fall into the hands of hostile militant groups like Hamas or the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Even though I understand the urge for peace now, we can't ignore the reality in the Middle East," he told Channel 10 TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The only alternative, he said, is to "secure ourselves and preserve the status quo because we do not have a real partner for peace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>For now, the United States and the European Union appear set to give the next Israeli government the benefit of the doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said in a statement that the 28-nation bloc was "committed to working with the incoming Israeli government on a mutually beneficial relationship as well as on the re-launch of the peace process."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It remains unclear, however, how long the world will wait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schafer said his government took Netanyahu's comments on Palestinian independence "very seriously."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We assume and hope that the current Israeli government's declared aim remains, which is to enter into talks with the Palestinians about a negotiated two-state solution at the end of which there will be a Palestinian state," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>An EU diplomat in Brussels said officials considered Netanyahu's rhetoric a "fundamental breach of the two-state solution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He said if Israel sticks to that policy, the EU will use its "leverage."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations, refused to elaborate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>But European officials in the past have discussed various potential measures, starting with the labeling of products made in West Bank settlements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>At home, meanwhile, Netanyahu risks facing a backlash from Israel's own Arab citizens, who make up about 20 percent of the population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Netanyahu's doomsday warnings about high Arab voter turnout prompted angry allegations of racism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Following the election, Netanyahu appeared to be trying to sooth tensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>On Wednesday, he visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City and vowed to "do anything in my power to ensure the well-being and security of all the citizens of Israel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>But Aida Tuma-Suleiman, an Arab lawmaker, said the country's Arab citizens would not forget so easily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Israeli Arabs have long complained of discrimination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"Yesterday Netanyahu divided the citizens of Israel. It is them and us, the Jews against the Arabs," she told Channel 10 TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"I won't let that go quietly. It is dangerous. If someone in France or England or Belgium would say, 'Go out and vote because the Jewish Belgians are voting,' what would have happened?"</td></tr>
