<h3>Indonesian maid beheadings won't stop Bali nine executions: AG</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>However Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo said Indonesia respected the rule of law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The difference is that we provide notification of an execution to the ambassador three days before it happens, but they did not," Mr Prasetyo was quoted saying by Philippines news website Rappler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The date of the execution of 10 drug felons, including Bali nine organisers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, is not known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However Mr Prasetyo has said it will not be until after the African-Asian conference, to be held in Jakarta and Bandung from April 19-24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said it was not a good look to shoot people when the country had many guests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Indonesian government summoned the Saudi ambassador after learning on Thursday Saudi Arabia had executed another Indonesian domestic worker, Karni binti Medi Tarsim, 37, who was convicted of murdering a 4-year-old girl in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It also issued statements protesting against the Saudi Arabian authorities' failure to notify them or the families before carrying out the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tarsim's killing followed that of Siti Zaenab, who was suspected of being mentally ill, on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Siti, 47, was convicted of murdering her employer's wife in 1999, but the execution was delayed until the youngest son was old enough to make a decision about whether she should be pardoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Indonesian government offered two billion rupiah ($200,000) in blood money and three Indonesian presidents - including Joko Widodo - made fruitless representations to save her life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Migrant Care executive director Anis Hidayah said the executions should provide momentum for the Indonesian Government to stop the practice of capital punishment in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The application of the death penalty at home will only make the government lose its moral legitimacy to urge other countries to free Indonesian nationals who are on death row."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Migrant Care's Ms Anis said there were at least 290 Indonesian migrant workers facing execution in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, China and Qatar, 59 of whom had already been sentenced to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>April 17 is the 10th anniversary of the Bali nine's arrest for attempting to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin into Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It is also Sukumaran's 34th birthday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Although the Australians are not allowed visitors on Fridays, Sukumaran's brother Chinthu took him a black forest cake on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While candles weren't allowed, the cake put a smile on Sukumaran's face, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Sukumaran's mentor, Ben Quilty, tweeted: "Happy birthday Myu. Arrested 10 years ago today. Your family and friends are very proud of the man you have become."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tina Bailey, who befriended Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran while teaching dance and art at Bali's Kerobokan jail, recently visited Nusakambangan and would go back soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She said friends and family had set up a roster of sorts to ensure the Australians had regular visitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Myuran is himself. He's healthy, he's smiling, he's in good spirits," Ms Bailey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Although Nusakambangan has a different feel to Kerobokan, Ms Bailey says the guards were very polite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It's definitely a more strict protocol situation - it needs to be, because it is a different sort of an island with nine prisons - but I felt the guards were very professional. Everything they did they explained."</td></tr>
