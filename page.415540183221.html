<h3>In shift, Nintendo moves to mobile</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>will soon show up on your smartphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nintendo announced Tuesday that, after resisting the move to mobile for years, it is striking a partnership with DeNA, a Japanese company that owns a popular mobile-gaming platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's a somewhat surprising move for Nintendo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When rumors about a possible move into mobile cropped up before, the company repeatedly insisted that it would make games only for its own devices such as the Wii U and 3DS lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But now comes a shift in thinking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to a statement, the company said "all Nintendo" intellectual property "will be eligible for development and exploration by the alliance," meaning that all Nintendo characters should be on the table, from Mario to Zelda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Investors thought the news was good for Nintendo, which analysts have criticized as being too slow to building an online presence for its devoted fan base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nintendo's stock was up more than 27 percent at $18.22 a share on the news during Tuesday's regular trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Still, the announcement does not mean that favorite titles from your childhood will be making it to your smartphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The release made it clear that "only new original games optimized for smart device functionality will be created, rather than porting games created specifically for the Wii U home console or the Nintendo 3DS portable system."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The overall strategy seems to be to have mobile titles act as complements to the company's main titles, possibly acting as a way to hook consumers into buying those more expensive and sophisticated games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nintendo has struggled some in adjusting to the new landscape of gaming, particularly with the rise of mobile, which has eaten into sales of games that offer lighter, family-focused fare that has been a linchpin of Nintendo's catalog for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The firm initially struggled to sell units of its Wii U console, though it saw stronger sales over the holidays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It also recently celebrated its latest Nintendo 3DS as the best-selling portable video-game system in February, besting Sony's PS Vita.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Nintendo also has been looking at new avenues of business, including a push into the smart health space, which helps consumers and their doctors measure various health statistics through software and gadgets such as the Wii Balance Board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The company also announced that it would build an "online membership" service on top of DeNA's existing services that can be reached from smart devices, the Wii U and 3DS, as well as from computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That's set to launch in the fall.</td></tr>
