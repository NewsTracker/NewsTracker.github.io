<h3>Hillary Clinton agrees to testify before Benghazi committee</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton has agreed to appear before a congressional committee investigating the 2012 attacks that killed the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans in Benghazi, according to her presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Saturday, a campaign spokesman said Mrs Clinton had responded to an invitation from Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the committee, to appear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Earlier this week we were pleased for Secretary Clinton to receive an offer from Congressman Gowdy to appear before the committee in a public hearing in October, and yesterday accepted his invitation," said Nick Merrill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While her campaign said a date had been set for October 22, the committee itself said negotiations continued over terms and conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Secretary Clinton's campaign may want to reach out to her lawyer, Mr David Kendall, with whom the Committee has had ongoing conversations. As of last night, Mr Kendall was still negotiating conditions for her appearance," the committee said in a statement, according to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chris Stevens, the US ambassador to Libya, died in 2012 when gunmen fired rocket propelled grenades into the American consulate in Benghazi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Obama administration officials initially said the attack was spontaneous and the result of a demonstration against a YouTube film which ridiculed Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In later briefings, however, they said it was a terrorist attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As the head of the US foreign service, Mrs Clinton has said responsibility for the deaths rests with her but a series of unconvincing performances under questioning has led her right-wing opponents to suspect a cover-up.</td></tr>
