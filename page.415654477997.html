<h3>After Vanuatu was hit by Cyclone Pam, one man ate finches and bats</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Three days before the category five cyclone hit 45-year-old Andrew Brooks travelled south to Tanna Island in the hopes he could climb the active Yasur volcano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The thrill seeker got more than he bargained for as the powerful cyclone hit in the early hours of the morning killing 16 people across the nation and demolishing almost everything in its path.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Brooks, along with 60 villagers and a score of tourists, sought refuge in a concrete school building and waited for the howling wind to stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He sat huddled with the villagers for four or five hours while the cyclone tore through, destroying the grass huts that made up the village.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After the winds stopped Mr Brooks soon realised he was stranded and spent the next five days cut off from civilisation at the foot of the volcano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was at this stage the villagers discovered that all the gardens and cooking houses were destroyed by the sheer force of the winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said they managed to find some rice vegetables and chicken which sustained them for a day or two before he was gobsmacked by what he was served next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said the resourceful villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting birds and bats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Any time anything flew past, whether it was a finch or a flying fox, there'd be this hail of sticks thrown at it," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They were getting finches and baby pigeons and eating them. And one morning they got a flying fox, which is quite large, and they cooked it up with rice and gave me a serve and they ate the rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He didn't complain about his interesting diet and said it was 'quite tasty' but tough, likening the flavours to that of chicken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Although he was happy not to be starving he said he had concerns about the villagers health and safety after the cyclone left them with nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"There are lots of young babies in the area and they were saying, 'Our babies are going to die and the old people are going to die', because it's so remote and they're at the end of the road so they're going to be the last to get aid, probably," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He reported that villagers were having to hike 4 kilometers up mountains to get fresh water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Brooks is worried the villagers will have trouble bouncing back from the disaster, adding that he hopes aid reaches the 'far-flung villages' like the one that sheltered him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Although no one he was with sustained injuries, people in nearby villages weren't so lucky with a mother and son perishing after they were struck with debris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Brooks said he intended to return to Vanuatu in the future to thank the villagers who sheltered and fed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>These revelations came as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop pledged Australia's long term support for Vanuatu during a visit to the Pacific nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Accompanied by the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, she strongly indicated that Australia would make a substantial contribution to the longer term rebuilding of the devastated nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Prime Minister I want to assure you that the Australian government and the Australian people will continue to support you in your time of need, not only in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, but I know that your long term recovery efforts will take some time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ms Bishop arrived Sunday morning to tour the cyclone relief centre in the capital Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She said Australia has sent over 11 military planes carrying lifesaving supplies and humanitarian support personnel.</td></tr>
