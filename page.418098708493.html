<h3>Marlins' slugger Stanton out 4-6 weeks with broken hand (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MIAMI (AP) -- For the second year in a row, Giancarlo Stanton's chances of winning the major league home run title have been hurt by an injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Miami Marlins slugger has a broken left hand, which is expected to sideline him four to six weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on Saturday and will meet with a hand specialist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Stanton, who grimaced as he swung and missed for strike three Friday night in the ninth inning of the Marlins' 7-1 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, said the injury became worse as the game progressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''We're hoping that it will be the quickest course possible, but certainly not great news when you lose a guy that means what he's meant to this ballclub and to baseball,'' Marlins manager Dan Jennings said before Saturday's game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Stanton led the majors with 27 homers and 67 RBIs when sidelined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last year he was in the thick of the home run race when a beaning ended his season on Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>11, and he finished tied for second in the majors with 37 homers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The latest injury means Stanton will miss the All-Star Game, and it's a big blow to a team that lost its fifth game in a row Friday to fall a season-worst 15 games below .500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While Stanton took lusty cuts in the ninth, he said the injury occurred earlier in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''On a swing, my bat dug into my hand a little bit and didn't feel the greatest,'' he said Friday after the loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Stanton's hand appeared swollen, and he said it hurt where he grips the bat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He went 0 for 4 on the night, which included a broken bat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He ground out in the first inning and struck out in the fourth, sixth and ninth innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Stanton said he didn't think the broken bat affected him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''No, I don't think it was that at-bat,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Stanton has 12 homers in June, tying the franchise record for any month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Despite his power surge, the Marlins had been woeful lately, batting .201 and averaging two runs a game over the past nine games through Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''Now it's upon us to pick it up and we can't feel sorry for ourselves,'' Jennings said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>His injury comes as the team anticipates the return Thursday of ace Jose Fernandez, who has been sidelined more than a year recovering from Tommy John surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Stanton signed a record $325 million, 13-year contract last November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At age 25 he has 181 career homers, but because of injuries has never played more than 150 games in a season.</td></tr>
