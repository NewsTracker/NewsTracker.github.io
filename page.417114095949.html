<h3>Europe dampens Greek hopes of swift deal as clock ticks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS/BRUSSELS, May 19 (Reuters) - Greece's European lenders on Tuesday played down Athens's hopes of a swift end to negotiations on an aid agreement and said talks must speed up before the country runs out of cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The sober outlook from Brussels and Berlin contrasted sharply with vigorous optimism displayed in Athens, where top officials from the new leftist government made a series of public appearances to promise that a deal was just days away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told a talk show overnight that a deal could arrive in a week, while Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said talks were in their "final stretch".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The comments helped push Greek stocks up 2.6 percent on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But euro zone policymakers said talks were not moving nearly as fast as needed to clinch a deal in a short time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"More time and effort is needed to bridge the gaps on the remaining open issues. We consider that progress is being made, albeit at a slow pace," European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a daily news briefing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Commission also denied a Greek newspaper report that its chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, had offered a compromise proposal to break the impasse in talks, which set a lower primary surplus target for Athens in return for tax reforms and tax hikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After a meeting in Berlin, the leaders of Germany and France said talks must be accelerated to free up fresh aid to Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'd say the talks need to speed up, rather than that they are going too fast," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>French President Francois Hollande agreed the talks with Greece needed to be "accelerated", adding: "We all have the same stance which is that Greece must stay in the euro zone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both leaders will meet Tsipras at an EU summit in Riga this week, where Greece is pushing for a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines to help broker a deal before it runs out of cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers that decides on aid disbursements, said it was unlikely a deal on Greece would be struck in the Latvian capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's not on the agenda for Friday," he told Dutch broadcaster RTL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I think it is unlikely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After staging a small economic recovery last year, Greece has returned to a full-blown crisis since Tsipras's leftist government took power in January promising to end austerity and unpopular bailout programmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Without access to debt markets or aid, the government has found itself locked in tough negotiations as cash coffers run dry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Athens is expected to scrape through payments to government workers and pensioners this month, but payments of 1.5 billion euros to the IMF next month will pose a much bigger challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A payment of about 750 million euros to the IMF last week was only made by emptying a holding account at the Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Labour Minister Panos Skourletis pointed to June 5 - when Greece's next loan payment to the IMF falls due - as the next crunch point for the cash-strapped country: "We all know that if there is no solution, let's say until then, in relation to funding, things will be difficult."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Talks with the European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders have dragged on for the past four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A successful conclusion would release of around 7.2 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in aid, but talks have stumbled over pension and labour reform proposed by the creditors and resisted by Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We believe that the pension system must be reformed but cutting pensions is not reform," Varoufakis told Greek television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We want a surgical intervention in the pensions system, not a butchering."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He blamed the lenders for turning down Greece's proposals and said talks should have ended in mid-March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The comprehensive review was like a cat chasing its tail," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In a speech on Tuesday, Varoufakis reiterated that Greece's debt was unsustainable and must be restructured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He accused the lenders of failing to admit that and of focusing instead on trying to achieve an arbitrary debt-to-GDP ratio in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"What we are trying to achieve is to get the other side to remove itself from a failed logic ... which for political reasons they cannot acknowledge," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>As the talks drag on and uncertainty over Greece's future in the single currency bloc grows, a new poll showed most Greeks are unhappy with the government's negotiating strategy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The University of Macedonia survey carried out over May 13-15 found 41 percent of Greeks felt the strategy "is not stable and is therefore sometimes right and sometimes wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Those who felt it was right fell to 35 percent from 72 percent in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>As many as 61 percent believe the government should water down its pre-election pledges given the circumstances, the poll said, compared with 35 percent who want them seen through.</td></tr>
