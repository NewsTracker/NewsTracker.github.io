<h3>GOP rivals take aim at Clinton</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As she made her bid for the Democratic nomination official Sunday, GOP presidential contenders who have long made her a target were hard at work lambasting her candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush connected Clinton to what he called President Barack Obama's damaging approach overseas and "failed big government policies" in a 49-second YouTube video prebutting Clinton's announcement that aired first on CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's critical we change the direction our country is heading. We must do better than the Obama-Clinton foreign policy that has damaged relationships with our allies and emboldened our enemies -- better than their failed big government policies that grow our debt and stand in the way of real economic growth and prosperity," Bush said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I believe it's conservative ideas that will renew America, grow our economy, put our fiscal house in order and make our great country even stronger," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bush also tweeted that America "must do better than Hillary," directing readers to his website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>We must do better than Hillary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If you're committed to stopping her, add your name now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>READ: What is Hillary Clinton thinking?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's campaign asked its supporters to sign a petition opposing Clinton's record, as Walker offered a series of tweets criticizing Clinton's foreign policy as secretary of state and her campaign style.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Americans want leaders from outside of Washington, D.C. with big, bold ideas which is what we're doing at @OurRevival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Texas Sen. Ted Cruz posted a 30-second video of his own arguing that Clinton's tenure as secretary of state has left the world less secure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Is the world a safer place because Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, meanwhile, is going on the air in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada -- four early-voting states in the nominating process -- with a minute-long television ad attacking Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The ad calls Clinton's candidacy "a path to the past -- a road to yesterday, to a place we've been to before."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Hillary Clinton represents the worst of the Washington machine: The arrogance of power, corruption and coverup, conflicts of interest, and failed leadership with tragic consequences," the female narrator says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Paul also laid into Clinton's tenure as Obama's secretary of state during an appearance on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He wouldn't name any positive accomplishments for the former first lady and New York senator during those four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And Paul said the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from foreign countries like Saudi Arabia and Brunei "questions the sincerity of whether or not she would be a champion for women's rights."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who said he's "more likely than not" to run for president, said on CNN that for Clinton, it's all about separating herself from Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"If she can make a case that she's different than him, then she'll have a chance. If she can't -- game, set, match," Graham said, using a tennis analogy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"She owns his foreign policy. She owns his domestic policy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The reason there's 20 Republicans running is that we all think we can beat her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said Clinton will have to "explain how she's not going to be Obama's third term" during an appearance on ABC's "This Week."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Hillary's going to be a very formidable candidate. There's no question about that," said Huckabee, who won the 2008 Iowa caucuses and is set to seek the GOP nomination again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"But she's got a lot to deal with this time that she didn't before," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"She's tied to the Obama administration. I don't think that is a plus for her. And recent polls show that there's almost an overwhelming demand for people to undo a lot of Obama's policies, both domestically and in foreign policy. She's going to have to explain how she's not going to be Obama's third term."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Days earlier, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum became the first Republican contender to make Clinton the target of an advertisement, releasing a web video that his campaign said was backed by a five-figure buy to push it to viewers through Google, Facebook and YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Santorum's web spot says Clinton "placed America in even greater peril in an already-dangerous world" by using a personal email address tied to a private, home-based server during her tenure as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"If Hillary Clinton has created this type of disaster as our secretary of state, how could we ever feel safe with her as our commander-in-chief?" the ad's narrator says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I know Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I served with Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>She does not have the right vision to lead America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Source: Clinton picks Brooklyn for campaign H.Q.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Can this Democrat really beat Hillary Clinton?</td></tr>
