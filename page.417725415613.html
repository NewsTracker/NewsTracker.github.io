<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Singer and songwriter Van Morrison has been given a knighthood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Belfast music veteran, whose unique meshing of blues, country, soul and folk has won him worldwide fame and millions of fans, has been honoured for his services to music and tourism in Northern Ireland, the inspiration for many of his hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He is among 1,163 people recognised by Britain's Queen Elizabeth for their achievements and, for the second time in the honours history, female recipients narrowly outnumber men.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>American actor and artistic director of the Old Vic theatre Kevin Spacey said he feels like "an adopted son" after being awarded an honorary knighthood for his services to British theatre and international culture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Spacey, who will step down from the role in the autumn after a 10-year reign at the London arts venue, said: "I am honoured and humbled by such recognition from the Queen. I must thank the British public for being so supportive of my efforts on behalf of the Old Vic. I feel like an adopted son."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Once again the names of some high-profile winners were leaked, with newspapers reporting comedian Lenny Henry's knighthood and Sherlock Holmes actor Benedict Cumberbatch's CBE days ahead of the official announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Henry, a long-time supporter of the BBC's Comic Relief, said learning the news gave him "a lovely feeling" and was "like being filled with lemonade".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ebola nurse Will Pooley, 30, who was urgently evacuated to London after contracting the deadly virus in Sierra Leone last year, only to return to his life-saving work just months after recovering, was named an MBE for his services in tackling the outbreak in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Also honoured for his major role in the Ebola crisis is Dr Oliver Johnson, whose swift actions in response to the initial outbreak saved many lives, the Foreign Office said as it named him an OBE for his overseas service in Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
