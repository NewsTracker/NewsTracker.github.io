<h3>Apple WWDC expected to focus on watch, music [Video]</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple is expected to unveil a new music service and better tools to build apps for its smartwatch at its annual gathering of developers in San Francisco on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The tech giant's legion of independent developers will get a preview of a new software kit for the two-month-old Apple Watch at the Worldwide Developers Conference, Jeff Williams, Apple's senior vice president of operations, said at a recent tech event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Like other Apple products, the watch's commercial success will likely hinge on a compelling collection of apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But early apps for the timepiece have been tethered to the iPhone, placing some limits on what developers could do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The expanded software kit should lead to better and faster watch apps, said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst at TECHnalysis Research.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apps built with the new toolkit will likely start arriving in the fall, Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many analysts expect that Apple will use Monday's event to debut a new music streaming service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The company behind the iPod and iTunes has long been a leader in digital music, but it has lost ground in recent years as subscription services such as Spotify have caught on with consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Analyst Van Baker of Gartner said he expects Apple to release a new service to win a bigger share of the streaming business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is catch-up for Apple," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Apple spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
