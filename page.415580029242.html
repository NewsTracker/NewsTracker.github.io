<h3>With 'no-state' pledge, Netanyahu reignites Palestine debate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It was a sweeping statement that flew in the face of his own past commitments and 25 years of international efforts to arrive at a two-state solution to the conflict: Israel and an independent Palestine living side-by-side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The European Union called on Israel to commit to the two-state goal at a "crucial moment".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The United Nations said the only way for Israel to remain democratic was to stick to the peace process, which sees two states as the final objective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest reaffirmed President Barack Obama's focus on a two-state solution and said that based on Netanyahu's comments, the United States "will evaluate our approach to this situation moving forward".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The question is whether Netanyahu - who shifted sharply to the right in the last days of his campaign, using messages such as the 'no-state' pledge to successfully draw right-wing votes away from ultranationalist parties - really meant what he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And if so, what it means for the Palestinians, relations with Israel and the future of the peace process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu later qualified his pre-election statement in an interview with the U.S. television network, MSNBC, on Thursday, saying he still seeks a two-state solution but the time may not be right for one just now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I don't want a one-state solution. I want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution. But for that circumstances have to change," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of Netanyahu's closest confidants, Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon, said on BBC radio the very idea of two states was unworkable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Can you imagine a viable Palestinian entity, economic-wise? What about infrastructure, electricity, water?" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"They are connected to us like a Siamese twin, so the whole idea of full separation is not viable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Around Netanyahu and on the right-wing of Israeli politics - including party leaders likely to be in his next government - it is common to hear that the two-state solution is dead, with no way of reconciling Israel's security demands with Palestinian independence and no willingness on Israel's part to share Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek as a capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Instead, right-wing leaders like Naftali Bennett, the head of the pro-settler Jewish Home party and a candidate for a top post in the next government, advocate Israel's annexation of most of the West Bank, while granting the Palestinians "enhanced autonomy" within the remaining 40 percent of the territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Even under a two-state scenario, Israel talks about retaining major settlement blocs and control of the Jordan Valley, where the West Bank borders Jordan, leaving a patchwork behind, although land swaps with Israel would provide some compensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The idea of dividing Jerusalem is dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The impression that emerges is that Israeli leaders on the right would ultimately prefer a model in which the Palestinians have a high degree of self-rule but Israel's military retains control in a form of "benign occupation" of the West Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There is no active discussion along those lines, or of a two-state solution, because the last peace talks broke down last April and Netanyahu has said repeatedly that he does not see Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has struck a unity deal with the Islamist group Hamas, as a partner for peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As long as Abbas remains in power - he was elected in 2005 and should have faced re-election in 2009 - that situation is unlikely to change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As a result, there is no process through which a two-state solution can be negotiated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>If the Palestinian leadership changes - Abbas has talked about elections but no dates have been set - Netanyahu would find himself under intense pressure to reengage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But for now, even U.S. diplomats acknowledge that getting Abbas and Netanyahu back together to negotiate is highly improbable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Instead, Netanyahu's dismissal of two states will encourage the Palestinians to again seek recognition via the United Nations as well as bilaterally - 135 of 193 UN members already recognize the State of Palestine, including several EU member states, even if the EU itself does not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We will not backtrack from our position in demanding that international legitimacy be achieved," Abbas said on Thursday, adding that Netanyahu's words were worrying but not new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The shift may come from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In the past, including last December, Washington has stood in the way of Palestinian efforts to get a U.N. resolution recognizing its statehood, including threatening to use its veto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But a U.S. official said it was possible the Obama administration would now allow a Security Council resolution on a two-state solution to proceed by withholding its veto, a move that would alarm Netanyahu's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The official stressed that the administration had yet to see language for a draft resolution that would meet its approval and that no decision had been made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>For the Palestinians, Netanyahu's intransigence - and his honest acknowledgement that he doesn't want a Palestinian state - may end up bolstering their cause while further isolating Israel internationally, particularly among its chief trading partners, the European Union and United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>An EU diplomat suggested on Wednesday that if Netanyahu sticks to his line, the EU will consider pushing ahead with trade restrictions and other measures against Israel.</td></tr>
