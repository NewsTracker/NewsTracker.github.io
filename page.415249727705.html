<h3>Woman says ex-boyfriend disguised himself before sexually assaulting her</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Testifying at a preliminary hearing at the Leighton Criminal Court Building, the woman, 26, said she didn't realize the attacker was ex-boyfriend Nathan Nissenbaum until his sunglasses fell off while he restrained her with handcuffs and duct tape before the sexual assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She testified that Nissenbaum threatened to kill himself during the Feb. 12 incident and warned that if she fought back, he would kill her as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"He said if I tried to fight it was going to be a murder/suicide instead of just a suicide," she told Judge Laura Sullivan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"He told me he was going to cut my face with a razor blade so I could never work again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sullivan found probable cause to believe that Nissenbaum carried out the sexual assault, a step in the criminal process before a trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He is contesting the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The woman testified she had successfully obtained a restraining order against Nissenbaum after they broke off a yearlong relationship last November, and he continued to allegedly send her about 50 email and text messages a day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The woman said she works as an escort and operates her business from her residence in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She described how her screening process requires a scanned copy of an ID, employment information and references from other escorts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She said Nissenbaum passed with an elaborate fake identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She testified she met the man, who looked like the photo on his ID, outside her building at about 10:30 a.m. and that they went to her apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There, she said he distracted her in the bathroom and grabbed her from behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When she struggled, he threatened her with the gun, then handcuffed her and bound her legs with duct tape, punched her in the her face, legs, stomach and choked her, she testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nissenbaum then booked a stay at an Evanston bed-and-breakfast where he said he planned to torture and rape her before killing himself, she testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He eventually unbound her legs and sexually assaulted her, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Later, she was able to get him to free her, and Nissenbaum decided he would kill himself in her bathtub since she wouldn't go with him to Evanston, according to her testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She testified that she laughed with him in the bathroom, poured him a glass of whiskey and then, when she heard the shower turn on, grabbed her dog and fled the apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nissenbaum allegedly cut himself with a razor in the bathtub and then set fire to the woman's bedding in the bathroom, hoping to kill himself, according to testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Detective Mark DiMeo, who interviewed him in the hospital after the attack, said Nissenbaum admitted slapping the woman several times to get her to stop screaming and admitted he knew she had an active order of protection against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He also admitted dying his beard black by using mascara, DiMeo testified.</td></tr>

<h3>Residents: Boko Haram readies for battle in NE Nigeria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A woman trapped there since Gwoza was seized in July told her daughter that Islamic extremists are urging civilians to leave town to avoid being killed in crossfire in an anticipated major battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hajiya Adama said her mother said the fighters also have released young women being held against their will, including some made pregnant during their captivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She said her mother left last week and escaped to the town of Yola, in neighboring Adamawa state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"She told me that Boko Haram terrorists asked them to leave suddenly, that they were preparing grounds for a major battle," Adama told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"She said while being helped by other women to leave through Madagali, they saw many Boko Haram terrorists in trucks and some on bikes moving toward Gwoza."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An intelligence officer said security forces are moving slowly for fear of harming civilians, and especially since Boko Haram is surrounding Gwoza with land mines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He confirmed forces from Chad are in the area, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Boko Haram in August declared an Islamic caliphate across a swath of northeast Nigeria where it held sway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In recent weeks, Chadian and Nigerian troops have retaken a score of towns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the militants continue to kill scores in suicide bombings and village attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Retaking Gwoza would be a major coup for Nigeria and for the campaign of President Goodluck Jonathan for re-election at critical March 28 ballots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Critics say the contest is too close to call between Jonathan, a southern Christian, and retired Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator who has vowed to stamp out the 6-year-old insurgency that has killed an estimated 12,000 people and left 1.6 million homeless.</td></tr>
