<h3>Google rides in: See Mongolia from the back of a horse-drawn sled</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Lake Khovsgol in Mongolia was captured by Google on horseback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After recording images of towns and cities across the world, Google's Street View service has launched via horse-drawn sled in a less likely location - the vast, sparsely-populated Asian country of Mongolia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The US technology giant used the sled to carry its camera to remote locations including Khuvsgul Lake, Asia's second-largest body of fresh water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>To capture rugged mountains near the Gobi desert, a local operator carried the camera in a backpack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>With a population of only 3 million and a territory over twice the size of France, Mongolia is the least densely populated country in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On the frozen Khuvsgul Lake, the horse-drawn camera was dragged across thick ice, showing arid brown hills in the near distance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The new images also allow virtual visitors to take a walk through the streets of the capital Ulanbatar, ringed by makeshift settlements including traditional yurts, or gers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Street View also shows off a huge equestrian statue of Genghis Khan, the 13th century Mongol warlord who cut a swathe of destruction across Asia and as far as Europe and is revered as the nation's founder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One scene shows a huge seated Buddha in the middle of a snow-covered temple complex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the mountains, the backpack camera takes viewers on a virtual tour of a hilltop monastery featuring meditation caves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Google hopes that bringing Street View to Mongolia will raise awareness of the country as an emerging destination for visitors around the world, and support the country's economic growth moving forward," said Google's Susan Pointer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Slightly larger than a basketball, Google's camera contains 15 individual fixed-focus lenses that simultaneously capture a 360-degree image roughly every three metres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Local officials said they welcomed the opportunity to preserve vanishing traces of Mongolia's traditional nomadic culture and boost tourism in a country well off the beaten path.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Photo: A Google Street View member walks with a specialized camera to record the surroundings of the Choijin Lama Museum in the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator.</td></tr>
