<h3>German tourists hand mayor $1200 as their share of WWII debt to Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Reminder of Nazi occupation in World War II adds tension to talks on contemporary Greek debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Berlin: Last week in the Greek village of Nafpolio, Germans Ludwig Zaccaro and Nina Lange handed 875, about $1200, to the mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The money, which the mayor said would be given to a local charity, was what the couple figured was their share of Germany's World War II debt to Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They'd always loved Greece, they said in an interview shown on Greek television, and felt bad about their country's role in the current economic difficulties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Our politicians pretend the Greeks owe debt to Germany, but the reality is that it is the other way around," Ms Lange said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Their point of view differs widely from the general German attitude about Greece - 80 per cent, polls show, don't want Germany to give any more aid to Greece and 50 per cent want Greece gone from the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But it strikes at an argument that the new Greek government is pressing: Germany owes Greece money, not the other way around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Germany has never repaid money that Germany forced Greece to lend it during World War II, the Greek government says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Now the Greeks would like it back, to help repay the $US330 billion ($430 billion) the country owes - $67 billion to Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The German government of Chancellor Angela Merkel bristles at the suggestion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It insists that any German debt from World War II was eliminated with the so-called Two-plus-Four Treaty that made possible the reunification of Germany in 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Greece will not be able to cover their debts by constructing German responsibilities dating back to World War II", German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said recently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Greece suffers not because of Berlin, or Brussels, but because its own elites have failed for decades."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This has all been settled; there can be no more claims," said Volker Kauder, a member of the German parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the view is not unanimous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Norman Paech, a retired law professor at Hamburg University and one of Germany's leading experts on war reparations, has been making a case for more than a decade that the Greeks have a case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The Greek claims with regard to the loan and German war crimes are legitimate from a political, legal and even more so from a moral point of view," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dr Paech argues that German officials are fighting against this obligation for a simple reason: there are other claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said the legal problem is that the 1953 London Treaty officially put all claims against Germany on hold until a lasting peace treaty could be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The 1990 treaty that unified Germany is that document, but it was signed only by the two Germanys and the United States, Great Britain, France and Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That means claims from any other countries are now active - for example, from Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Gaps are appearing among Germany politicians, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Can Germans really claim anything from a nation they occupied and looted only 70 years ago?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Not just the fringe parties are raising the question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Some members of the Social Democratic Party, partners in government with Ms Merkel's Christian Democrats, are leaning toward the position taken by Mr Zaccaro and Ms Lange in Nafpolio: Something is owed.</td></tr>
