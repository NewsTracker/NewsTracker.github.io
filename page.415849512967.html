<h3>Coney Island Cyclone gets stuck during inaugural run on opening day</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 24 passengers made their way slowly from around 10ft from the top of the the 88-year-old roller coaster after it stopped at about 12pm on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The riders were enjoying the first public ride during the opening of Luna Park's summer season before it malfunctioned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They were able to climb down to safety and there were no reported injuries following the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Riders were left stranded after the legendary Coney Island Cyclone got stuck at the top of its track during its inaugural run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After the roller coaster came to a halt, riders were stranded for about ten minutes before they climbed down the small walkway lining the track, according to CBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'It was terrifying, because I was up there and everything was spinning,' Gabriella Centeno said once she climbed to the bottom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A small mechanical glitch was likely the cause of the roller coaster getting stuck, said Luna Park spokeswoman Erica Hoffman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Angie Morris, the park's brand manager, said a problem like this one had not happened in a long time, and that tests were conducted on the roller coaster during the last month ahead of opening day, according to NBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Another rider, who is afraid of heights, said the climb down was made easier with the help of the park's employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ann Dartany said: 'I'm scared of heights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But with their help I made it down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prior to the two dozen passengers getting stuck, a group of dignitaries had taken a ride on the Cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The roller coaster was closed while technicians repaired it and officials said they hoped it would only be shut down for a maximum of two hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'The most important part obviously is that everybody was safe,' said Hoffman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>During opening day, the first 100 guests were given a free ride on the Cyclone, according to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some riders waited overnight so that they could be at the front of the line and one of the first to take part in the Cyclone's inaugural run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While thrill-seekers flocked to the amusement park in not-so-summery temperatures, it did not stop members of the Coney Island Polar Bear Club from taking a dip in the Atlantic Ocean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And to officially set off the 2015 season with what has become a yearly ritual, Brooklyn Borough president Eric Adams broke a bottle of Egg Cream on the roller coaster.</td></tr>
