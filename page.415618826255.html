<h3>Meet the unsung heroes who have keyed NYCFC?s fast start</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Much has been made of New York City FC's high-priced attacking stars, such as David Villa, Mix Diskerud and the still-to-arrive Frank Lampard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But it's NYCFC's underrated defense that has exceeded all expectations, and has the expansion team unbeaten going into Saturday's game at the Colorado Rapids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That defense - filled with MLS journeymen making a fraction of what Villa and Lampard will earn - has allowed just one goal through the first two games, that a tough-luck 91st-minute deflection by Kaka in a season-opening 1-1 draw at Orlando.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With Villa still settling into MLS, NYCFC may have to lean on that defense going across the country to the high altitude of Colorado.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"One of the challenges that I'm laying for the players is to set a foundation of who we are," coach Jason Kreis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"And for me, that starts with what are we willing and able to do defensively for each other. The guys' level of commitment they put in on the defensive side was very good. That can be bad or good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But can they?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A back four of fullbacks Jeb Brovsky and Josh Williams and centerbacks Jason Hernandez and Chris Wingert (converting from left back) have jelled quicker than anybody had a right to expect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They have left goalkeeper Josh Saunders with little to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In one regard, any time there's an expansion team and we're trying to learn each other's tendencies, and gel as a unit on the fly, there's going to be growing pains and ups-and-downs,'' Hernandez said. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Luckily we put a lot of hard work in preseason and the guys we have as a defensive unit have played a lot of games in MLS, are battle-tested, guys that've been there before know what to expect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>What will be asked Saturday is to keep a clean sheet against a Rapids team that played to a scoreless draw in its opener against Philadelphia, with defender Alex Sjoberg dominant in the air as goalkeeper Clint Irwin posted a shutout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Villa, who was invisible in the NYFC opener, adjusted to the physicality of MLS with a goal and assist in the 2-0 home-opening win over New England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Now he will have to adjust to other hurdles many foreign stars face here, lengthy travel and daunting weather, in this case the mile-high altitude and thin air of Commerce City, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"There is no issue there," Villa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hernandez has played 220 MLS games, all but five of them for Western Conference teams San Jose and Chivas USA, which made regular trips to Dick's Sporting Goods Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The air is thinner, the balls are going to sail, [but] you'll get a second wind,'' Hernandez said. "</td></tr>

<h3>Gonzaga moves on with 86-76 win over ND State (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For North Dakota State, it's back to the grocery store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kyle Wiltjer scored 23 points Friday night to lift the second-seeded Bulldogs to an 86-76 victory over a scrappy, fun-to-watch No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>15 seed from Fargo that practices in a warehouse and lifts weights in an out-of-commission supermarket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gonzaga reached the round of 32 in NCAA Tournament for the seventh straight year, matching Kansas for the longest-running streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But it's the next game that's been the problem for the Zags (33-2).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The team that's made 17 straight trips to the tournament hasn't been to the second weekend since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gonzaga plays Iowa on Sunday to try to break that streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''We celebrate,'' coach Mark Few said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''Any time you get a win this time of year, you need to celebrate it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's a special, special happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>You never take it for granted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This was no stress-free warm-up game for Gonzaga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sophomore Dexter Werner had a career-high 22 points - almost all of them entertaining - while keeping North Dakota State (23-10) within range for much of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Bison, upset winners over Oklahoma as a 12 seed last year, couldn't muster a repeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Still, it was quite a season for a team that lost three starters and its head coach from last year and had to improvise while their facilities were being overhauled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''I think (Richman has) done an amazing job for a first-year coach,'' Few said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''The story where they don't even have a gym to work out in and they're working out in a warehouse and lifting weights in a meat locker or whatever they've got going there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Kevin Pangos had 18 points for the Bulldogs, who were cheered on by a big crowd that drove across the state on I-90 to watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>For much of the second half, those fans must have been shaking their heads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It was no surprise that Bison guard Lawrence Alexander, who sent last year's Oklahoma game into overtime with a tying 3, had 19 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But when Werner, who averages only 8 points but can dribble, head fake and drop the baby hook, started going off in the second half, the game got interesting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Over five minutes, he scored 11 points - capping it with a twisting, lean-in 17-footer - and also drew a charge to help cut a one-time 15-point deficit to six.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''I'd pick him up any day,'' Wiltjer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But on the possession after the 17-footer, Werner bumped into Pangos as he was shooting a 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The shot fell and the four-point play bumped the lead to 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Bison didn't threaten again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Gonzaga shot 51.7 percent, just a tad under its nation-leading average this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Overall, Richman's nightmare - that the Bulldogs would produce from both inside and outside - came true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Pangos, a senior, made four 3-pointers and added five assists without a turnover in his usual sparkling floor game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Gary Bell Jr., a junior, had 13 points and made Alexander work hard for his shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Both those guards have felt the disappointment in each of Gonzaga's recent first-weekend flameouts, including a drubbing last year at the hands of Arizona and a loss to Wichita State the year before when the Zags were the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>1 seed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In Spokane, there's hope this year could be different, in large part thanks to Wiltjer's decision to transfer from Kentucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He was money in this one: 8 for 12 from the floor, 2 for 3 from 3-point range and 5 for 5 from the line, with eight rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''He wants to win so badly,'' Pangos said of his new teammate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>North Dakota State: The renovation at the Bison's facility in Fargo will cost about $50 million and should be complete before next season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>... Also scoring in double figures were Paul Miller (13) and Kory Brown (10).</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Gonzaga: The Zags, who rank fifth in the country in assist-to-turnover ratio at 1.56, finished with 16 assists and nine turnovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>North Dakota State's season is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Gonzaga plays Iowa on Sunday.</td></tr>
