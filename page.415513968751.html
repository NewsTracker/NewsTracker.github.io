<h3>Robert Durst Charged With First-Degree Murder</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Durst, a millionaire from one of America's wealthiest families, agreed Monday to return to Los Angeles to face a 15-year-old murder charge after muttering that he "killed them all" in a documentary about his links to three sensational killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Real estate heir Robert Durst was charged with one count of first-degree murder with the special circumstances of murder of a witness, as well as lying in wait and gun use allegations, the Los Angeles County DA said today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The charges, which carry the death penalty, are in connection with the 2000 murder of his friend, Susan Berman, in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Prosecutors have been working closely with the Los Angeles Police Department for the past two years investigating the cold case murder. Durst is charged with murdering Berman on or about Dec. 23, 2000. Her body was discovered in her Benedict Canyon home on Christmas Eve," the DA said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Durst was arrested at a Marriott hotel in New Orleans over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Louisiana State Trooper Melissa Matey confirmed to ABC News tonight that an arrest warrant was issued for Durst and he was rebooked in the Orleans Parish Jail under two new charges: convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance, which was a small amount of marijuana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The 71-year-old appeared before a judge earlier today in New Orleans for the extradition hearing, where his lawyers agreed to have him sent back to California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Robert Durst Says on HBO 'What the Hell Did I Do?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Durst, who was chained and shackled at waist and feet, wore a orange jumpsuit and smiled for a bit as he looked around the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He had been kept in a glass holding booth before appearing before a judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Let me just say that we came here to waive jurisdiction and to go back to California and to get it on," Durst's lawyer Dick DeGuerin said in front of the courthouse after the hearing was over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Bob Durst didn't kill Susan Berman--he's ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial but we're frustrated because the local authorities are considering filing charges on him here and holding him here," DeGuerin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>PHOTO: Robert Durst sits with his attorney Dick DeGuerin, Nov. 10, 2003 at the Galveston County Courthouse in Galveston, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Durst, the son of a wealthy New York real estate family, was the subject of a HBO series detailing the disappearance of his wife Kathleen, the murder of his friend Susan Berman and the death of his neighbor Morris Black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Durst was acquitted in 2003 of Black's murder, but was never charged in connection to Kathleen's disappearance or Berman's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Berman was scheduled to meet with investigators looking into Kathleen's 1982 disappearance when Berman was found shot in the back of the head in her Los Angeles home, investigators said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Durst was arrested just before the finale of the HBO series where he was heard on a recording saying that he "killed them all."</td></tr>

<h3>Too Much Parenting, Not Enough Exercise</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Children with parents who tended to be overly involved in their academic, athletic and social lives-a child-rearing style known as hyper-parenting-spent less time outdoors, played fewer after-school sports and were less likely to bike or walk to school, friends' homes, parks and playgrounds than children with less-involved parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hyperparenting, although it's intended to benefit children by giving them extra time and attention, could have adverse consequences for their health, the researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The study, at Queen's University in Ontario, surveyed 724 parents of children, ages 7 to 12 years old, born in the U.S. and Canada from 2002 to 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>(The survey was based on parents' interaction with the oldest child.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Questionnaires assessed four hyper-parenting styles: helicopter or overprotective parents; little-emperor parents who shower children with material goods; so-called tiger moms who push for exceptional achievement; and parents who schedule excessive extracurricular activities, termed concerted cultivation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hyperparenting was ranked in five categories from low to high based on average scores in the four styles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Children's preferred play location was their yard at home, and 64% of the children played there at least three times a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Only 12% played on streets and cul-de-sacs away from home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Just over a quarter walked or cycled to school or friends' homes, and slightly fewer to parks and playgrounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Organized sports participation was 26%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Of parents, about 40% had high hyper-parenting scores and 6% had low scores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The most active children had parents with low to below-average scores in all four hyper-parenting styles, while the least active had parents with average-to-high hyper-parenting scores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The difference between children in the low and high hyper-parenting groups was equivalent to about 20 physical-activity sessions a week, the researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Of the four styles assessed, only little emperor, tiger mom and concerted cultivation were independently associated with lower physical activity in 7- to 12-year-olds, the study found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Helicopter parenting was the most common behavior reported by parents, but it wasn't associated with physical activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The reason for this isn't clear, but a possible explanation is that the hyperparenting scores for the helicopter parents were all quite high, said researcher Ian Janssen, a professor of kinesiology and public health at Queen's University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Statistically it is more difficult to find associations when there is little variability in measurements across a study sample, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Caveat: All information was self-reported by parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The duration of physical activity wasn't assessed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Fallopian function: Tubal ligation, a common sterilization procedure for women, may trigger cellular changes in a woman's fallopian tubes that help to prevent the development of ovarian cancer, says a study published online in Reproductive Sciences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tubal ligation, often referred to as having your tubes tied, prevents eggs released by the ovaries from passing through the fallopian tubes to the uterus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The procedure renders fallopian tubes biologically inactive, the researchers suggest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This loss of fallopian function may prevent the buildup of genetic mutations that can lead to cancer, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The procedure is associated with a 19% reduced risk of ovarian cancer, according to a 2013 meta-analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But few studies have examined tissue changes that might contribute to the lower risk, according to the study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, analyzed fallopian-tube specimens from 10 women who had undergone tubal ligation and 10 controls with intact fallopian tubes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The groups included pre- and postmenopausal women 31 to 62 years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The part of the fallopian tube that ends in a fringe, or fimbria, near the ovary contained approximately one-ninth the number of progenitor cells-specialized cells that help tissues regenerate-in the tubal-ligation group than controls, the study found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Many ovarian cancers are known to originate in this section of the tube, the researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Fallopian specimens from the tubal-ligation group also contained significantly fewer proteins called Ki67, which are associated with increased risk of cancer, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Separate experiments were conducted on mice that underwent tubal ligation or, as part of a control group, an operation that mimicked the procedure but left the fallopian tubes intact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>After a four-week recovery, the tubal-ligation mice had significantly fewer tubal cells with regenerative properties: 1.6%, compared with 3% in controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Caveat: The study analyzed fallopian tissue from a small number of women and mice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Neural resilience: Natural, age-related brain changes impair motor function in older people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>But staying physically active appears to dampen the effects of these changes, a study published online in Neurology suggests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>High levels of daily activity didn't appear to stop the development of small pockets of abnormal brain tissue often found in older people, the study found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Instead, the brain abnormalities had no effect on movement and motor skills of those people, the research showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>In less active people, however, brain changes were associated with poor motor function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Previous research has suggested physical activity may help older people maintain cognitive function despite brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>This study suggests regular activity could also contribute to a neural reserve or resiliency that could help to preserve motor function in later life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Frequent daily activity may increase production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, a protein found in the brain and spinal cord that plays a role in the growth and maintenance of neurons, the study suggests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago recruited 132 women and 35 men at an average age of 80 years old from a larger study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The subjects underwent cognitive and neurological testing, including an MRI of the brain that was analyzed for small brain lesions called white matter hyperintensities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The lesions have been linked to increased risk of cognitive decline, falls and stroke, previous research has shown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Motor function was assessed with 11 tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Total daily activity, including exercise and non-exercise movement, was measured by an actigraph, a sensor worn on the wrist continuously for about 11 days, and self-reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Activity ranged from about 20 minutes to six hours a day, the actigraphs showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The difference between highly active subjects in the top 10% and those with daily activity levels in the middle range was equivalent to walking an additional 90 minutes a day at 2.5 miles an hour, a relatively slow pace, the researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Caveat: White matter hyperintensities were the only measure of brain health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Longer physical activity measurements may provide important findings not captured in the study, the researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Grinding teeth: Anxiety during social situations may increase the risk of teeth grinding, a condition called bruxism that can cause tooth erosion, according to a study in the Journal of Oral Rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Bruxism was more common among anxious subjects than non-anxious controls, but only during the day, the study found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>No association was found between bruxism and depression or use of antidepressant drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which have previously been linked to bruxism, researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Bruxism can occur during sleep or wakefulness, the study said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Dopamine, a hormone that helps to regulate emotions and movement, may play a role in bruxism and social anxiety, it suggests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel recruited 75 men and women in their early 30s for the study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>One group, with 40 people, had social phobia, an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive fear in social situations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Just under half of this group was taking SSRIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>A control group of 35 didn't have social phobia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>The subjects underwent psychiatric and dental exams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Bruxism symptoms and oral habits, such as gum chewing, nail biting and small jaw movements with no tooth contact, termed jaw play, were assessed with questionnaires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Symptoms of awake bruxism were reported by 42.5% of social phobia patients and by 3% of controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Sleep bruxism was also higher in the social phobia group compared with controls, but the difference wasn't statistically significant, suggesting interaction with people is needed to trigger bruxism in socially anxious people, researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Moderate-to-severe dental wear was found in 42.1% of the social phobia subjects and 28.6% of controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The rate of jaw play was 32.5% in the phobia group and 12.1% in controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Treating social anxiety may help bruxism, the study suggests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Caveat: The study involved a relatively small number of subjects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Bruxism symptoms were self-reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Joint association: Older men with gout were nearly four times as likely to have osteoarthritis in the knee than men without gout, a pilot study in the March issue of the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Knee osteoarthritis was also more common in men who had uric acid crystal deposits called tophi on non-knee joints but no symptoms of gout, the study found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Tophi are an indicator of abnormally high uric acid levels and a hallmark of gout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Osteoarthritis, which occurs when cartilage on the ends of bones wears down, is a disabling joint disease that affects an estimated 20 million Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>At present, the disease has no recognized biomarkers that could serve as potential targets for preventive treatments, researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Osteoarthritis and gout, a common inflammatory arthritis, have sometimes been linked in clinical settings, but few studies have examined their relationship, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>The presence of tophi in non-knee joints may be an indication that crystallization is occurring at microscopic levels in the knees, the study suggests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Researchers recruited 115 men, 55 to 85 years old, during routine visits to the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System in New York City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Gout was diagnosed in 29 men, while 31 had elevated uric acid levels but no gout symptoms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>A control group of 55 men had normal uric acid levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Knee osteoarthritis was assessed with X-rays, examinations and questionnaires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Tophi deposits on hands, knees, feet, ears and elbows were assessed with ultrasound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Knee osteoarthritis was diagnosed in 68% of gout patients, 52% of men with elevated uric acid and 28% of controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Only tophi in toe joints were associated with a statistically significant increase in knee osteoarthritis, researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Gout subjects had more pain, stiffness and functional difficulties than other subjects and were more likely to have arthritis in both knees and a higher BMI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Caveat: The synovial fluid in the knee joint wasn't tested and might have identified additional gout patients, researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>The study used one measurement of uric acid, which can fluctuate, they said.</td></tr>
