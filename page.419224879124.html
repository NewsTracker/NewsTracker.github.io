<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>St. Louis County police makes arrests along West Florissant Avenue on Aug. 10, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The city was on edge again Monday, a day after a protest marking the anniversary of Michael Brown's death was punctuated with gunfire and one man was seriously wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police officers and protesters face off along West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson, Mo., on Aug. 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Protests in suburb of St. Louis on the anniversary of Michael Brown's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police arrested nearly two dozen people in Ferguson during a protest that stretched into early Tuesday marking the anniversary of the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, although there was no repeat of the violence that scarred weekend demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There were no shots fired and no burglaries, looting or property damage during the protest along West Florissant Avenue, county police spokesman Shawn McGuire said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The St. Louis suburb thoroughfare was the focus of months of massive protests and sometimes violent unrest last summer after the killing of Brown by a Ferguson police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A sense of dread returned to the St. Louis area as demonstrations continued Monday and officials declared a state of emergency, fearing another spiral of violence could shatter the riot-scarred area's fragile recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But on Monday night, no smoke or tear gas was used, and no police or civilians reported injuries, McGuire said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>By 1 a.m., the crowd and police were heading home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>McGuire said approximately 23 arrests were made, though police were still confirming official totals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Late Sunday, a protest in the same area was interrupted by gunfire and a police shooting that left an 18-year-old suspect critically injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The violence set Ferguson on edge and had protest leaders worried that tensions could escalate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger declared a state of emergency that authorized county police Chief Jon Belmar to take control of police emergency management in and around Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Early Monday evening, hundreds of protesters were chanting, beating drums and carrying signs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When some in the group moved into a traffic lane, officers in riot gear forced people out of the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some demonstrators threw water bottles and other debris at officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"They're not going to take the street tonight," Belmar told The Associated Press: "That's not going to happen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Protests also cropped up outside Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Almost 60 people, including scholar and civil rights activist Cornel West, were arrested around midday Monday for blocking the entrance to the federal courthouse in downtown St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Another group later briefly blocked Interstate 70 during the late afternoon rush hour, with an additional 64 arrests, according to McGuire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Ferguson resident and military veteran Hershel Myers Jr., 46, criticized the police response as aggressive and unnecessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At the Sunday night demonstration, tensions escalated after several hundred people gathered in the street, ignoring repeated warnings to get to the sidewalk or face arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Several gunshots rang out from an area near a strip of stores, including some that had been looted moments earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The shots sent protesters and reporters running for cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Belmar said he believed there were six gunmen, including 18-year-old Tyrone Harris Jr., who the police chief said opened fire on officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Police had been watching Harris during the protest out of concern that he was armed, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>During the gunfire, Harris crossed the street and apparently spotted plainclothes officers arriving in an unmarked van with distinctive red and blue police lights, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Police said the suspect shot into the windshield of the van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The four officers in the van fired back, then pursued him on foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The suspect again fired on the officers when he became trapped in a fenced-in area, Belmar said, and all four opened fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Harris was in critical condition after surgery Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Prosecutors announced 10 charges against him - five counts of armed criminal action, four counts of first-degree assault on a law enforcement officer and a firearms charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>All 10 are felonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The officers in the van were wearing protective vests and escaped injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>They were not wearing body cameras, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Harris' father called the police version of events "a bunch of lies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Tyrone Harris Sr. told The Associated Press that two girls who were with his son told him the 18-year-old was unarmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>They said he had been drawn into a dispute involving two groups of young people and was "running for his life" after the gunfire broke out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He said his son was a close friend of Michael Brown and was in Ferguson on Sunday night to pay respects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"My son was running to the police to ask for help, and he was shot," Harris said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"It's all a bunch of lies. ... They're making my son look like a criminal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Online court records show that Tyrone Harris Jr. was charged in November with stealing a motor vehicle and a gun, as well as resisting arrest by fleeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>A court hearing in that case is scheduled for Aug. 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Belmar said the suspect who fired on officers used a stolen semi-automatic 9 mm gun.</td></tr>
