<h3>Minister: Suicide bombers kill 23 in attacks on Chad capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) - Suicide bombers on motorcycles simultaneously attacked two buildings including the national police academy in Chad's capital on Monday, killing at least 23 people and wounding more than 100 others in the first assault of its kind since Islamic militants threatened the country earlier this year, witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There was no immediate claim of responsibility but suspicion quickly fell on Boko Haram, the group based in neighboring Nigeria that already has attacked Chadian villages along the lake that divides the two countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chad has been a major military ally in the fight against the insurgent group, and Boko Haram's leader has publicly threatened the Chadian president in retaliation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Information Minister Hassan Sylla Bakari said at least 23 people had been killed and more than 100 others wounded, in addition to the four dead attackers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Witnesses reported seeing a suicide bomber in each attack; it was not immediately clear what role the other two individuals may have played.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Witnesses said a suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up outside a government building where the head of the national police is based after security officers unsuccessfully tried to subdue the attacker by shooting at him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A second explosion also went off at the headquarters of the national police academy in the capital at the same time, witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Boko Haram's leader back in February had taunted the Chadian president after he contributed forces to the regional effort to quash the extremist group.</td></tr>
