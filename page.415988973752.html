<h3>Breanna Stewart and Sue Semrau are AP Player, Coach of Year (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Breanna Stewart has joined another exclusive club, and she is only a junior.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Connecticut's versatile star is the winner of The Associated Press Player of the Year award for the second consecutive year, becoming just the fifth player to accomplish the feat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Florida State's Sue Semrau was selected as coach of the year for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The pair accepted their awards at the women's Final Four on Saturday in front of a crowd that included the entire UConn team and her parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Stewart was honored to receive the award with Semrau, who coached her on the USA Basketball under-19 world championship team in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Stewart, a unanimous All-American for the second straight season, got 20 votes from the 35-member national media panel that selects the weekly Top 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Notre Dame's Jewell Loyd received the other 15 votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was the closest race since 2007, when Courtney Paris edged Candace Parker and Lindsey Harding by two votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Stewart joined Brittney Griner, Maya Moore, Seimone Augustus and Chamique Holdsclaw as the only two-time winners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>No player has won the award three times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''It means a lot and when you name those names and to be put in that category it's an unbelievable honor and accomplishment,'' Stewart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''It goes to show how hard I worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Stewart helped the Huskies win the national championship in her first two years at the school and has UConn two victories away from a third straight title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The 6-foot-4 guard/forward averaged 17.6 points and 7.6 rebounds while helping UConn to a 36-1 record this season and an eighth straight trip to the Final Four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''People are under the impression that because Stewie doesn't get 30 every night that she can't,'' UConn coach Geno Auriemma said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''If Stewie wanted to ... she could do it every night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If we didn't have the balanced team that we have, she'd be doing it every night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They'd be talking about her as the best player by far in America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>While this is somewhat old hat for Stewart, Semrau earned her first AP coach of the year honor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Semrau guided the Seminoles to their best season ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Florida State made it to the regional finals of the NCAA Tournament before losing to South Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It also won a school-record 32 games, including 14 in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and reached the conference tournament final for the first time in school history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Semrau deftly handled a roster that featured five Division I transfers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>All the new faces could have resulted in very little team cohesion, but under her leadership the group became the best team in Florida State history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''It's really remarkable how these players were determined to take the initiative to develop into a team,'' Semrau said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Semrau said there was so much uncertainty coming into the season she wasn't sure how they would do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''I just didn't know what to expect,'' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>She received 10 votes, edging Princeton's Courtney Banghart, who guided the Tigers to the first undefeated regular season in school history and their first NCAA Tournament win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Banghart got nine votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Final Four participants Brenda Frese of Maryland, Geno Auriemma of UConn and Dawn Staley of South Carolina also received votes.</td></tr>
