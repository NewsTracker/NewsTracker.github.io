But if he really loves FIFA, he should have put its interests ahead of his own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Platini said he likes Blatter on a personal level, his explicit criticism of the FIFA chief points to a deep rift between the two men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He opted last August not to challenge Blatter in the election of 209 FIFA member federations and now supports the only opponent: FIFA vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platini, now 59, was a key campaigner helping Blatter become FIFA president in 1998 and then a long-time heir apparent.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"The World Cup in Russia will be able to stabilize all this situation that is in this region of Europe," said Blatter, who has been closely allied to the 2018 host's president, Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Boycotting a World Cup or any sporting event has never brought any solutions to nobody," added Blatter, who has been an International Olympic Committee member for 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blatter noted sharply that the Council of Europe had switched their boycott calls in recent months from the World Cup in Qatar to Russia's tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a direct interference," said Blatter, reminding that FIFA - which counts Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko among its executive committee members - has rules against government meddling in soccer affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am not campaigning," Blatter said to the reporters who were briefed that he would not address election issues at a news conference following a two-day session of the FIFA executive committee.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
