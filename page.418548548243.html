<h3>Tspiras battles for bailout programme approval</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is battling to win approval in parliament on for a bailout deal to keep Greece in the euro, while the country's creditors, pressed by the IMF to provide massive debt relief, struggled to agree a financial lifeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Having reluctantly conceded to negotiating a third bailout from international lenders on stringent terms, Mr Tsipras must face down a rebellion in his Syriza party to push sweeping pro-market reforms and spending cuts through parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's a difficult deal, a deal for which only time will show if it is economically viable," his finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said during a debate on reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dozens of MPs, including senior Syriza figures and the government's junior coalition partner, may partially or fully reject the bailout, forcing Mr Tsipras to rely on pro-European opposition politicians to carry the vote, which is expected after 10pm Irish time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A snap election could follow if the prime minister's majority collapses, and in an early sign of trouble in store, the deputy finance minister Nadia Valavani abruptly submitted her resignation and the energy minister said he would not back the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The choice between a bailout or catastrophe is a choice made in the face of terror," Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads the far-left flank of Syriza, told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Adding to the uncertainty, a confidential study by the International Monetary Fund, seen by Reuters, called for much more debt relief than European countries, particularly Germany, have been prepared to countenance so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Germany insists on having the IMF in the negotiations to help keep Greece in line, and may countenance extending maturities for Greek debt provided there was no write down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Technically, this possibility exists," said finance ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger when asked about the option of extending the maturities of Greek debt to 30 years or so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"That is certainly an element that one can consider, but it will not be the solution if it leads to a significant reduction in the cash value (of the debt) as then we would in the end have nothing other than a debt haircut via the backdoor," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The European Commission published its own assessment of Greece's debt burden today that also offered the prospect of debt relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While also ruling out any write-offs, the commission said debt reprofiling was possible, as long as Greece implemented the reforms it has committed to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In addition, Brussels has proposed 7 billion in bridge financing to keep Greece afloat this month, when it must repay crucial loans to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The plan could prove controversial as it would use the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), an EU-wide fund, roping in countries like the UK who balk at their taxpayers contributing to a rescue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fighting his own battle with Brussels to reform the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron joined calls to give Greece debt relief but ruled out contributing to the bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A source at the British finance ministry has said the UK has insisted that any contribution it makes to a Greek financing deal is fully protected and its concerns had been accommodated by other European partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"As far as we are concerned, this is a red line and we think that message is now being heard and understood," the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It is because we have refused to compromise on our principles that the Commission is now proposing ways to specifically ring-fence us from any risk."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Although the bailout package is much tougher than the Greek people could have imagined when they resoundingly rejected a previous offer from the creditors in a referendum on 5 July. most want to keep the euro.</td></tr>
