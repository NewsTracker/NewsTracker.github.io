<h3>Bali Nine pair executions set for 3am</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Indonesian firing squad has executed Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran and six other drug offenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The executions went ahead despite heavy international pressure on Indonesia and President Joko Widodo to grant clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Officials on Cilicap have yet to confirm the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Attorney-General HM Prasetyo will leave Jakarta for Cilacap at 5.30am (0830 AEST) where he is expected to make a statement, Cabinet Secretary, Andi Widjajanto said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Indonesian media has reported the eight were shot dead at 12.25am (0325 AEST) on the island of Nusakambangan on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We've carried out the executions," an Attorney General Office official, talking to the press on condition of anonymity, said, The Jakarta Post reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Cilacap police officer told the Post: "The executions went well, without any disruptions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prayers were said for each of the eight, according to their respective religion, after the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The others executed were Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, Nigerians Sylvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Raheem Agbaje Salami and Okwudili Oyatanze, and Ghanaian Martin Anderson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso of the Philippines was spared after a woman who allegedly recruited her to act as a drug courier gave himself up to police in the Philippines on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"There was a request from the Philippine president regarding the perpetrator who's suspected of committing human trafficking and surrendered in the Philippines," an attorney-general spokesman said in a text message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Just hours before the scheduled executions, Australia, the European Union and France issued a statement calling on Joko to change his mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"In filing this petition, we ask Indonesia to reflect upon the impact on Indonesia's position in the world and its international reputation. We support Indonesia's efforts in obtaining clemency for its citizens abroad. Stopping this execution will help those efforts," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We fully respect the sovereignty of Indonesia. But we are against the death penalty in our country and abroad. The execution will not have a deterrent effect on drug-trafficking or stop others from becoming victims of drug abuse. Executing these prisoners now will not achieve anything."</td></tr>
