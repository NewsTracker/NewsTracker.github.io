<tr><td>7</td><td>"And if we think otherwise, then we're very foolish."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Carol," based on Highsmith's 1952 novel "The Price of Salt," was one of the most anticipated films at Cannes and emerged a likely contender for the Palme d'Or and, later in the year, the Academy Awards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The eroticism of "Carol" comes largely through subtle, hidden gestures, but Blanchett and Mara were asked about shooting the film's tasteful sex scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Blanchett, a mother of four, said being naked hasn't been as much an issue for her since giving birth with "a lot of strangers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's an important scene," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mara added: "I'm nude quite often so it wasn't a big deal for me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Blanchett also added her voice to the growing chorus over sexism is Hollywood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's important to keep talking about it," said Blanchett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It fell off the agenda and I think we lost a lot of ground."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The screenwriter Phyllis Nagy didn't contradict her, but added a note of optimism.</td></tr>
