<h3>Apple puts news at core of revamped system</h3>

<tr><td>3</td><td>The Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in New York City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Washington: Apple is diving deeper into the news business with a new application that could make the US tech giant a key industry player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple News, part of the upcoming iOS 9 operating system, aims to be the primary news source for users of the iPhone and iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a surprising move, Apple has unveiled it will be hiring experienced journalists to manage its news feeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Customers browse Apple Watches in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This marks a distinction from rivals such as Facebook, which is crafting formulas that aim to deliver articles users want based on their web habits, demographics and interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Apple is eager to have news created by human beings and not algorithms - it fits in with the brand statement Apple has been making," said Judd Slivka, a professor of mobile journalism at the University of Missouri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The expectation is they will put together a smart team that works well broadly across news and specific content areas."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Although Apple is likely to use some algorithms to filter stories, the hiring of experienced journalists is a positive step, said Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"A lot of people don't want to be fed news that a robot has decided interests them," Professor Kennedy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Especially if you don't have any say how the robot makes that decision. The Facebook algorithm is highly mysterious, and people are starting to resent that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But Professor Kennedy was cautious about technology companies increasingly becoming gatekeepers for news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I'm not crazy about the idea of shifting news to huge corporations like Apple and Facebook that have their own agendas," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Partner news organisations include Conde Nast magazines, ESPN, The New York Times, Hearst, Time Inc., CNN and Bloomberg, but Apple will be opening to other publishers and bloggers.</td></tr>
