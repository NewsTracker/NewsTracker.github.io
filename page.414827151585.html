<h3>European court rejects Polish appeal in CIA jail case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The court's decision will add to pressure on other European countries to end years of secrecy about their involvement in the CIA's global program of secret detention after the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>11, 2001, attacks on the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Polish foreign ministry, which had delayed implementing the court's ruling by submitting a request for an appeal, said in a statement it would now abide by the court's decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The original ruling in July last year included a demand that Poland swiftly conclude a criminal investigation into the jail, and pay compensation totaling 230,000 euros ($262,660) to two men who were held there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Poland is required to finally conduct a thorough and effective investigation, make public information concerning its role and hold those responsible to account," Helen Duffy, the lawyer for one of the men, Abu Zubaydah, said of Tuesday's decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is remarkable, and an affront to the rule of law, that despite the mass of information now available to us still no one has been held to account for torture," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The wall of secrecy around the CIA program of "extraordinary rendition," already started to crumble in December last year when the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee published a report into the scheme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It detailed how dozens of detainees in CIA-run sites around the world were subject to torture -- including waterboarding or simulated drowning, and mock executions -- with little useful intelligence gained as a result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After the release of the Senate report, former Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski and former prime minister Leszek Miller acknowledged for the first time that they knew the CIA had been holding people on Polish soil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But they said they knew nothing about what was happening inside the detention center, codenamed Quartz, in a villa on the grounds of an intelligence training academy in a Polish forest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Lawyers for ex-detainees say the investigation is being deliberately stalled to avoid a politically embarrassing trial, possibly of senior Polish officials, but prosecutors deny that and say the case is complex and needs time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Amrit Singh, a lawyer with the Open Society Justice Initiative who acted for Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, one of the men who brought the case against Poland, said Tuesday's ruling established a precedent for other countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This judgment sends a message loud and clear that European states that collaborated in the CIA torture program cannot evade accountability," said Singh.</td></tr>

<h3>News24.com | Danish intelligence: No sign gunman was planning attacks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, known by its Danish acronym PET, said the report in September didn't give any reason to believe that the 22-year-old was planning an attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>PET also said it didn't have any intelligence before the gunman's shooting sprees at a cultural centre and synagogue that an attack was imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>PET chief Jens Madsen declined to elaborate when reached by phone on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are in the middle of an investigation with many aspects, many things to look into, there are lots of unanswered questions right now," he told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A Danish documentary filmmaker and a Jewish security guard died and five police officers were wounded in the shootings before the gunman was killed early on Sunday in a firefight with a SWAT team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Two sources close to the case identified the gunman to The Associated Press as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One said he was released from jail about two weeks before the attacks after serving time for a stabbing in November 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A Denmark native with Palestinian parents, El-Hussein had been in and out of prison since 2011 after being convicted of weapons, violence and other offences, court documents showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While he was awaiting trial for the random stabbing attack on a train passenger, a change in his behaviour last summer set off enough "alarm bells" for jail authorities to alert PET, Denmark's counter-terror agency, a source close to the investigation told AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Such warnings usually set in motion counter-radicalisation efforts, such as counselling in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It wasn't immediately clear how aware the court was of this issue; court documents didn't mention it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His defence lawyer in that case, Rolf Lindegaard Gregersen, said he didn't know whether El-Hussein had been radicalised in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"But nothing like that came up during the trial," Lindegaard Gregersen told AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sentenced to the time he had already served, El-Hussein was released about two weeks ago, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because police haven't officially identified the gunman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Monday, a judge ordered 10 days of pre-trial detention for two people accused of helping el-Hussein get rid of a weapon while evading authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Both men deny the charges, said Michael Juul Eriksen, a defence lawyer for one of the two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said there was no indication that the gunman was part of a wider cell, but gave no evidence for that claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She joined Danish Crown Prince Frederik, foreign dignitaries and some 30 000 people on Monday night to honor the victims outside the Krudttoenden cultural centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The centre, which was hosting a panel discussion with a Swedish artist who had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, was the gunman's first target on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The artist, Lars Vilks, was whisked away unharmed by his bodyguards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A 55-year-old documentary filmmaker was killed and three police officers were wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Later Saturday, police say, the gunman visited an internet cafe before moving on to the synagogue, where he opened fire early on Sunday on the Jewish security guard and two police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Reached by phone on Tuesday, Vilks said he expects security to be raised at any future events that he attends and that he has faith in his bodyguards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I have not feared for my life in a long time. I have security," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Denmark has foiled a series of terror plots since the 2005 publication of 12 caricatures of the prophet in the Jyllands-Posten newspaper triggered riots in Muslim countries and calls for vengeance.</td></tr>
