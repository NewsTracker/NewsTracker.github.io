<h3>Next from Google: Teleconferencing?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Next from Google: Teleconferencing?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google could be working on a teleconferencing platform in the latest push by the U.S. search giant into the enterprise space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>No official announcement has been made, but screenshots posted by Google+ user Florian Kiersch show the interface for "GMeet", likely short for Google Meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>From the images, it appears that users are able to schedule meetings online and those who are invited can join with the click of a button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google has not responded for a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Florian's Google+ post says it is only available to "Googlers" - or Google employees - but it is likely to roll out to a broader base of users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Users could also be able to join as guests if they have an event code or know one of the participants, Florian wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google already has Hangouts, a messaging and video calling platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>GMeet looks likely to work in a similar way with calls being made over the internet but it is unclear whether this will be a consumer or business platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At the moment, most teleconferences involve entering a long series of code numbers to set up and join.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Google's service appears to want to make the process easier by just clicking a button to join a call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Florian's screenshots show a GMeet app, but the post notes there is a Chrome extension so users of Google's web browser can access the service easily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The U.S. search giant made a further push into enterprise technology earlier this year when it unveiled the "Android for Work" program - a set of services aimed at businesses to secure Android devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This included a separate work profile on Android smartphones, a Google Play for Work app store, and suite of special business apps.</td></tr>
