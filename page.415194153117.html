<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Scurfield was shot dead on Monday, March 2, 2015 in Syria, a Kurdish commander said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At least one other foreign fighter, Australian Ase Johnson, is known to have been killed fighting alongside the Kurds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>IRBIL, Iraq (AP) - A British citizen fighting alongside Kurdish forces against the Islamic State group has been killed in Syria, a Kurdish commander said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, an ex-Royal Marine, was shot dead March 2 in the front-line village of Tel Khuzela, Kurdish commander Redor Khalil told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Another foreign fighter battling with the Kurds, American Jordan Matson, said he was with the body on Wednesday and was working on getting the remains back to Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We're trying to make contact with his mother to see what her wishes are," Matson told the AP Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Otherwise, he wished to be buried here under an olive tree."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Matson said on his Facebook page that Scurfield also had Greek citizenship and had served in the Greek army and as a British Royal Marine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Scurfield was 25 years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dozens of foreign fighters have traveled to Syria and neighboring Iraq to fight with Kurdish militias battling the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Matson and four other foreign nationals told the AP last month that they arranged to join Kurdish forces through the Facebook page run by the People's Protection Units, or YPG, the main Kurdish militia fighting in northern Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At least one other foreign fighter, Australian Ashley Johnson, who went by the name of Ase, is known to have been killed fighting alongside the Kurds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Islamic State group, which currently holds territory in a third of Iraq and Syria, has recruited thousands of foreign fighters, mainly from Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Scurfield's parents, Chris and Vicci Scurfield, are archeologists who live in a former farmhouse in the village of Royston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In an interview with Sky News on Wednesday, his mother said the family is "reeling" from the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The British Foreign Office said it is aware of reports that a British national died in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"As we do not have any representation in Syria it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dan Jarvis, the local member of parliament from Barnsley Central, where Scurfield is from, said Wednesday that the Briton traveled to Syria to provide humanitarian aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"My understanding was that he went there for honorable reasons," Jarvis told Sky News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There are other ways in which people who have these legitimate concerns can make a contribution, supporting charities or NGOs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The advice is rightly not to go there," Jarvis added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Neither the U.S. nor the U.K. have banned citizens from fighting with militias against the Islamic State group, though both consider the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, a terrorist organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The PKK, which waged a long and bloody insurgency against Ankara, is believed to have close ties to the YPG and is fighting alongside it in northern Iraq and in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Australians are forbidden by law from fighting with any force outside of the Australian national army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Australia was also one of the first countries to criminalize travel to Syria's al-Raqqa province, where the Islamic State group has established the de facto capital of its self-styled caliphate.</td></tr>

<h3>Is this the most Aussie response to an accident ever? Motorcyclist gets knocked off his bike... but turns around to give the driver a THUMBS UP and shakes his hand</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Motorcyclist Mathew Sant was travelling along Canberra Avenue toward the city on Tuesday in an 80km/h zone when he was rear-ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Instead of reacting furiously though, he gave the guilty driver a thumbs up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'Traffic had backed up ahead and come to a stop,' he said on YouTube after uploading a video of what happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'As I came to a stop I checked my mirror and moved to the right of the road in case the car behind wasn't paying attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the YouTube video Mr Sant is seen going steadily along, minding his own business, in a lane of traffic and all seems to be going well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, after coming to a standstill because the cars in front have stopped, a car comes up behind the motorcyclist and crashes into the back of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Sant would have been within his rights to give the driver what for, but flashes him a thumbs up instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Even then Mr Sant remains cool and composed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He shakes hands with the driver and laughs at all that just happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It is only then that the motorcyclist walks back to see the carnage that occurred behind him.</td></tr>
