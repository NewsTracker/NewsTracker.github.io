<h3>Heroes who've made a tradition of courage: The humility of Britain's bravest family who have just won ANOTHER Victoria Cross?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Born and raised in Kenya, he cut a dashing and tough figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>What he was to achieve on the battlefield that day was exceptional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Initially, the attack against the Italians went well, and the Rifles managed to secure a bridgehead on the other side of the river.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Leakey's role was to help bring mortar fire onto the Italian positions, but he soon ran out of ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was at that moment that the Italian tanks mounted a counter-attack, and it looked as if the bridgehead would be over-run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Armed only with a handful of grenades and a revolver, Leakey charged forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He ran through heavy rifle and machine-gun fire, clambered onto a tank and wrenched open the hatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A startled tank commander looked up and Leakey shot him dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Without pausing, Leakey reached into the turret and killed the rest of the crew, apart from the driver, who he ordered to drive into some cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Leakey's plan was to use the main gun of the tank, but he could not get it to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He got out, shouting 'I'll get them on foot', and again ran through heavy gunfire until he found another Italian tank he could climb aboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Once more, Leakey pulled open the hatch and shot dead a member of the crew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But his luck was not to hold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Another Italian tank spotted him and raked him with its machine-gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It is likely he was dead before he hit the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Despite his death, Leakey's actions broke up the Italian attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Though it was not immediately known by the British, one of the Italians Leakey had shot had been the commander of the tank unit, and he had therefore left the Italian counter-attack without a leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As a result, the bridgehead was kept secure and the Allies won the battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Rifles took nearly 500 prisoners of war, and close to 100 Italians were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It had been an emphatic victory, but if it had not been for Nigel Leakey, it might have been a terrible defeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>For his actions that day, he was posthumously awarded Britain's highest award for gallantry - the Victoria Cross.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>His citation rightly states that he showed 'superb courage and magnificent fighting spirit'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Just over seven decades later, on August 22, 2013, a 25-year-old lance corporal in the Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan's Helmand Province discovers that he and his men are in a very bad spot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>As part of a task force entrusted with disrupting insurgent safe havens, the paratroopers are working with the U.S. Marine Corps to destroy a Taliban stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>However, the operation goes wrong as soon as the force is landed by helicopter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Much of the team, including two machine-gunners and a mortar section, is pinned down by Taliban fire, and the Marine Corps captain is soon wounded.However, the lance corporal is not part of the group that is trapped, but realises he needs to act fast if he is to save his comrades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>With 'complete disregard for his own safety', as the official citation notes, the young NCO rushes down a slope that is being sprayed with machine-gun fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He reaches the captain, gives him first aid and - despite being the most junior commander in the area - arranges for his evacuation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Then, the lance corporal takes two machine-guns up to the top of the steep slope from where they can be used to return fire to the enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He is required to make two trips weighed down with heavy kit, and with enemy rounds hitting the frames of the machine-guns he is carrying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>By what could be seen as a miracle, the lance corporal makes it and then returns fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>'This proved to be the turning point,' the official account states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'Inspired by (his) actions, and with a heavy weight of fire now at their disposal, the force began to fight back with renewed ferocity.' Thanks to his almost superhuman bravery, 11 insurgents are killed and four are wounded, and the captain is able to be evacuated safely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>It comes as no surprise that the lance corporal is recommended for the VC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>'Displaying gritty leadership well above that expected of his rank, (his) actions single-handedly regained the initiative and prevented considerable loss of life, allowing a wounded officer to be evacuated,' his superiors concluded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Finally, on Thursday, he was presented the award by General Sir Nick Carter, the head of the British Army, at a ceremony at Lancaster House in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>And the young man's name?</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Joshua Mark Leakey, a cousin of the Leakey who won his VC in Ethiopia 72 years before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>It is impossible to overstate quite how extraordinary it is to have two members of the same family winning the VC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The courage of Nigel and Joshua Leakey alone, running through murderous machine-gun fire to save their comrades in distant lands, would be exceptional enough, but these two men are by no means the only members of their family who have shown amazing gallantry.Indeed, in a week dominated by vapid Oscar celebrations and puffed-up pop stars at the Brits, the Lucky Leakeys' story reminds us of values which are truly to be celebrated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Over the past century, the family have served this country with the utmost courage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In fact, it is no exaggeration to claim that the Leakeys - distant relatives of the prominent Kenyan family whose most famous member is the politician and conservationist Richard Leakey - can lay claim to being Britain's bravest family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>When Nigel Leakey was killed in May 1941, the news came as a terrible blow to his younger brother, Arundell 'Rea' Leakey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>At the time of his brother's death, the 25-year-old Rea was serving in North Africa as a captain in the 1st Tank Regiment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Rea had many fond memories of growing up with Nigel, whom he idolised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The two boys had been sent to a tough boarding school in Africa, where they had often got into trouble, usually for misdemeanours such as pinching apples.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Despite being beaten with a whip made from rhino hide, the spirit of the brothers remained undimmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>'We were little heroes to the rest of the boys, because the weals were red and bleeding,' Rea later recalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Like his brother, Rea was also to prove himself as a hero to the 'boys' in a far more deadly game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>On January 21, 1941, Rea was commanding a light tank reconnaissance patrol near the airfield of Martuba in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Like Nigel, Rea was doing his bit to kick the Italians out of Africa, in what was known as Operation Compass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>As Rea and his unit advanced, he came under heavy fire from enemy guns and tanks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>A lesser man would have turned back, but he pressed on, and managed to outwit the Italians and complete the patrol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>For his actions that day, he was recommended for the Military Cross.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The commendation stated that 'he has always shown dash and gallantry on patrols'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Of course, compared to his brother's VC, Rea's achievement seems modest, but as any serving soldier will tell you, winning an MC is an impressive feat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Besides, it wasn't as if that was the only medal that Rea was going to win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Just eight months later, in August 1941, Rea could be found in the fortress port of Tobruk, which the Allies were desperately trying to defend from the onslaught of Rommel, commander of Germany's North African campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Fed up with six months of having to sit tight and endure constant bombardment, Rea volunteered to be attached temporarily as a private to the 2/23 Australian Infantry Battalion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>On the night of August 8-9, Rea accompanied two Australians to man an observation post three miles south of the Sidi Daud sector of Tobruk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>It was a risky task, as the Germans knew the location of the post, and the unit was ordered to withdraw if they were attacked by a superior force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>At 5.30pm on August 9, the Germans did, indeed, attack - with 26 men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>But like his brother, and his cousin Joshua decades later, Rea was not a man to run away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Taking command of the unit, he waited for the Germans to get close, then ordered the two Australians to open fire at the last moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Rea was manning a Bren gun, but to his horror, it jammed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Desperate, he ordered the two Australians to throw grenades while he tried to clear the gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>The enemy went to ground, but one valorous wounded German decided to mount a solo charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Just in time, Rea managed to shoot the attacker right between the eyes with his revolver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>'It was the best shot of my life,' he would recall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>With the Bren gun cleared, he and his small unit were able to wipe out the enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>In total, the three men killed 21 Germans and wounded a further five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Not one escaped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>For such heroism, one might have expected Rea to be awarded a VC, but instead, he was 'merely' awarded another MC 'for his very fine personal courage'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>In later years, the incident was portrayed in the war comic Victor, from which Rea took a lot of boyish pleasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>But there were more medals to be won.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>In October 1944, now an acting lieutenant-colonel at the immensely young age of 28, Rea was commanding the 7th Battalion of the Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) in the Dunkirk sector on Northern France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>As well as leading his own men, Rea also worked closely with the Czech Armoured Brigade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>The Czechs admired Rea to such an extent that they, too, awarded him their own Military Cross, which was approved by no less than Field Marshal Montgomery himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>The commendation cited Rea's 'personal courage and coolness', as well as his 'keen sense of co-operation' with the Czechs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Rea was to win one more medal - the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>This was awarded for his leadership of the 5th Battalion of the RTR towards the end of the war in Germany, during which he successfully led his men and tanks against strong opposition from the SS and Luftwaffe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>'The leadership and disregard for personal safety of this young CO has been as noticeable as has his efficiency, drive and quick reactions,' the commendation read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>After the war, Rea was to rise to major general, and even wrote a memoir called Leakey's Luck, despite his life being touched by further immense grief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>One evening in October 1954, his 60-year-old father, Gray Leakey, and his mother and step-sister Diana were attacked by 30 native Mau Mau terrorists at their home 100 miles north of Nairobi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Having been accepted into the local Kikuyu tribe as a 'blood brother', Gray did not believe that the Mau Mau would harm him, and he refused to arm himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Displaying typical Leakey bravery, Gray had once come across an armed band of Mau Mau in a forest, and he had simply turned his back on them and walked away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>But that night in 1954, his luck would run out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Though Diana managed to hide in the attic, Mrs Leakey was too frail to follow her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>The Mau Mau found her and slashed her to death on the lawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Gray's body was found a few days later after a massive manhunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>He had been buried alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Rea's son followed him into the military: today, Lieutenant General David Leakey is Black Rod, the Queen's representative in Parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>And there is yet another story of Leakey bravery, which was to take place over the Mediterranean one night in November 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Returning from a bombing mission over Iraq, 41-year-old RAF wing commander Mark Leakey negotiated his Harrier jump jet onto the deck of the aircraft carrier Invincible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>After 20 days on the go, he was tired, and made a mistake on his approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>Instead of touching down on the carrier, he landed on the water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Just before he lost consciousness, it is possible he thought of his wife Rosemary and two young boys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Leakey came round, but in his confused and groggy state, pulled not only his life jacket toggle, but also the handle of his ejector seat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>What he had not realised was that his Harrier was upside down: he was fired straight down into the water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>But the Leakeys are a lucky bunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>In 1982, when Mark Leakey was flying near the Falklands, his engine gave up and he had to eject over the South Atlantic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>The Royal Navy once more found themselves fishing Leakey out of the sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Incredibly, when he was given a medical check, it was revealed he had a brain tumour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>Thanks to the crash, it was spotted and operated upon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>In a sense, the crash saved his life, and meant Leakey could be around to watch his two boys grow up into fine young men.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt court lists Hamas 'terrorist group,' sentences Brotherhood members</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Egyptian court designated the Palestinian group Hamas as a "terrorist organization," judicial sources said on Saturday, part of a sustained crackdown on opposition groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a separate case earlier in the day, a court sentenced the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood's top leader, Mohamed Badie, to life in prison, while other members of the group received the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Saturday's ruling comes just days after Egypt adopted a new anti-terrorism law allowing the authorities to close the premises of any declared "terrorist" organisation, and to freeze its assets as well as those of its members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hamas was founded by the Muslim Brotherhood, which authorities in Egypt have also declared a "terrorist group."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The army ousted one of its leaders, Mohamed Morsi, from the presidency as part of a 2013 coup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Morsi himself is facing several trials on charges that are punishable by death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some 22,000 people have been arrested since Morsi's ouster, including most of the Brotherhood's leaders, as well as secular activists swept up by police during protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The relationship between Egypt's authorities and Hamas has soured since Morsi's ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Muslim Brotherhood has been banned in Egypt since the military coup in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since then, Egyptian authorities have accused Hamas of aiding armed groups, who have waged a string of deadly attacks on security forces in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In January, an Egyptian court also declared Hamas' armed wing al-Qassam Brigades a "terrorist" group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The case was based on allegations that al-Qassam staged attacks to support the Muslim Brotherhood, and carried out deadly operations in the Sinai Peninsula in October 2014, allegations that the group denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Armed groups in Sinai have killed scores of policemen and soldiers since Morsi's overthrow, vowing revenge for a crackdown on his supporters that has left more than 1,400 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Egyptian court's decision to list the Hamas movement as a terror organization is shocking and is dangerous, and it targets the Palestinian people and its factions of resistance," Hamas said in a statement after the ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It will have no influence on the Hamas movement," Hamas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The ruling Saturday by Judge Mohamed el-Sayed of the Court For Urgent Matters said Hamas had targeted both civilians and security forces inside the Sinai Peninsula, and that the group aimed to harm the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It has been proven without any doubt that the movement has committed acts of sabotage, assassinations and the killing of innocent civilians and members of the armed forces and police in Egypt," the court wrote, according to state news agency MENA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While a court ruled in January that Hamas' armed wing was a terrorist organization, Saturday's broader ruling against the entire group has potentially greater consequences for the relationship between Cairo and Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip on Egypt's border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After the January decision against Hamas' Qassem Brigades, a source close to the armed wing signaled the group would no longer accept Egypt as a broker between it and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Cairo has for many years played a central role in engineering ceasefires between Israel and Hamas, including a truce reached between the sides in August that ended a 50-day Gaza war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A spokesman for the Egyptian government declined to say what actions the government would take to enforce the ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Meanwhile, Badie, the top leader of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, was among 14 who were sentenced to life, alongside deputy leader Khairat El-Shater and leading figure Mohamed El-Beltagy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Four lower-level members were sentenced to death for inciting violence that led to the killing of protesters demonstrating outside a Brotherhood office days before Morsi's ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Two of those sentenced to death and three sentenced to life were tried in absentia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The death sentences are subject to appeal and many of the defendants are already serving lengthy sentences on other charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Badie has already been sentenced to multiple life terms, and was one of hundreds given the death sentence in a mass trial that drew international criticism of Egypt's judicial system.</td></tr>
