<h3>Euro zone business growth up as new orders pour in</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Euro zone business activity accelerated in March at its fastest pace for nearly a year as customers took advantage of ongoing price discounting to place new orders at a rate not seen since mid-2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The upbeat survey will provide welcome news for the European Central Bank just weeks after it embarked on a trillion-euro asset-purchase programme to try and spur growth and inflation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Markit's final March Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good indicator of growth, stood at 54.0, a touch below the preliminary estimate of 54.1 but well ahead of February's 53.3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A reading above 50 implies growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The PMIs are indicating somewhat sluggish GDP growth of 0.3% for the first quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, the important message from the survey data is that the pace of expansion looks set to gather pace in coming months," said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Markit's growth projection is slightly less than the 0.4% predicted in a Reuters poll taken last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A sub-index measuring new orders leapt to 54.1 from 52.5, its highest since May 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That suggests a healthier outlook although the survey also showed companies have now been cutting prices for three years, although not as sharply in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Euro zone consumer prices fell again in March, as expected, but the decline was the smallest this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That price-cutting helped drive service industry activity up at its fastest pace in eight months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The March service sector PMI rose to 54.2 from 53.7, just below the flash 54.3 estimate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With the recovery gathering steam and confidence growing because of the ECB's QE programme, service companies were at their most optimistic since May 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The business expectations sub-index came in at 64.8 compared with February's 64.1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"With the ECB's policy of quantitative easing also set to provide a boost to the nascent recovery in coming months, the economic outlook is therefore brightening as we expect to see more upward revisions to growth forecasts for the year," Williamson said.</td></tr>
