<tr><td>6</td><td>The State Department said Kerry would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But in a sign of the considerable strains, the Kremlin said Putin's attendance had yet to be confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This trip is part of our ongoing effort to maintain direct lines of communication with senior Russian officials and to ensure U.S. views are clearly conveyed," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In addition to Ukraine and Syria, she said the talks would also focus on the ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the group of nations known as the P5+1 - Russia, the United States, Germany, Britain, France and China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The short trip to Sochi will be only Kerry's second to Russia since taking office.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>The White House said the missile system would give the Islamic republic's military a strong deterrent against any air attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Kremlin argues that the S-300 is a purely defensive system that will not jeopardize the security of Israel or any other countries in the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>On Syria, Russia has defied a chorus of international condemnation to remain fast to the embattled government of President Bashar Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Following his stop in Sochi, Kerry will travel on to Antalya, Turkey, where he will attend a meeting of NATO foreign ministers on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Kerry will return to Washington that same day to attend meetings between President Barack Obama and top officials of the Gulf Arab states that are concerned by the possibility of a nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
