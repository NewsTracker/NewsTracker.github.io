<h3>Fabricio Werdum shocks Cain Velasquez, Mexico City crowd at UFC 188</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY - Cain Velasquez had so thoroughly dominated the pre-fight conversation that it seemed like almost a given that he'd dominate Saturday night's UFC heavyweight championship bout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Interim champion Fabricio Werdum had other ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Brazilian shocked fight fans on Saturday night, silencing an emotional Mexico City crowd by submitting Velasquez with a guillotine in the third round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was a fight Mexican fans had waited to see for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Velasquez is one of the country's most beloved athletes, and after almost two years spent sidelined by injuries, his first-ever fight in Mexico City was treated almost as a coronation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For the first-round, it looked to be just that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Velasquez landed a number of big shots and Werdum appeared to be gassing out by the end of the opening frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The noise in the crowd was deafening and a Velasquez victory began to feel almost like a foregone conclusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Then, Werdum came out for the second round and appeared to tap into some previously unseen energy source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His strikes were landing flush, his movement appeared faster, and Velasquez was fading right as his opponent found a rhythm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the third it was more of the same, and when Velasquez went for a takedown - he'd been avoiding engaging with Werdum on the ground all fight - it seemed almost desperate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Once they got to the mat, the fight didn't last long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Within seconds, Werdum's superior jiu-jitsu skills took over and Velasquez was tapping his out just 2:15 into the third round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I'm sorry to everyone here, my dream was to fight here," Velasquez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I'll come back and I'll win that title again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When Kelvin Gastelum was told by UFC bosses that he wouldn't be fighting as a welterweight anymore, there wasn't much he could say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>All he could do was go out and put on the type of performance that would make Dana White & Co. feel like they needed to keep him happy and allow him to go back down to 170 lbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Saturday night at UFC 188, Gastelum sure gave them something to think about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Fighting at middleweight (185 lbs.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>, the 23-year-old dominated Nate Marquardt for two rounds before the veteran's corner mercifully threw in the towel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Hopefully this performance was good enough to get on their good sides and tell them to give me a good opportunity at 170 lbs.," Gastelum said in the octagon after the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After missing weight by 9 lbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>prior to loss to Tyron Woodley back at UFC 183 in January, Gastelum was forced out of the welterweight division by White.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He'd previously fought at middleweight when he was competing on the Ultimate Fighter, but is short for the 185 lbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>division and would prefer to fight in the lower weight-class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>On Saturday, though, he looked as good as he's looked in any of his UFC fights, hurting Marquardt with his strikes and controlling the match from the opening bell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>There were several moments in the second round during which it looked as if the ref might step in and stop the fight, but Marquardt held on until corner-man Trevor Wittman made the decision to end the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>For two rounds, Eddie Alvarez could barely see out of his left eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Didn't matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The former Bellator lightweight champion recovered from a vicious Gilbert Melendez elbow to gut-out a split decision win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It wasn't the elbow itself that caused the swelling around his right eye, though, it was only when Alvarez blew his nose after the first-round that a welt the size of a golf ball grew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A lesser fighter might not have carried on - and he was immediately taken to the hospital after the fight - but Alvarez actually came out and looked better in the second and third rounds than he had in the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Philadelphia-bred fighter was able to take Melendez to the mat a number of times and got the better of the majority of striking exchanges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The win was Alvarez's first in the UFC after losing his debut to Donald Cerrone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>There were still lingering questions about his abilities despite an impressive Bellator resume, but a win over the organization's No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>4-ranked lightweight should be enough to answer his critics.</td></tr>
