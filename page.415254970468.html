<h3>Apple finally joins dow jones industrial average after splitting stocks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple has finally been accepted to join America's oldest and most prestigious stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company - worth more than $700 billion - will replace telecom giant AT&T on the list with the switch taking effect after trading closes on Wednesday, March 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There are only 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones - a price-weighted average of the biggest stocks - but for a long time Apple was excluded from the pile because its stock price was too high and there was worry it would distort the balance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, following Apple's big stock split last summer, this is no longer a problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company increased the number of shares it had to reduce the unit price from around $645 to $91.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Currently the price rests around $130.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With Apple's entry AT&T will leave the Dow Jones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said there was no need to have two big telecom companies in the equation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Verizon, which has a bigger stock price and larger market value, is in the Dow too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It will step in to lead the sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The last big shake-up of the 119-year old Dow came in September, 2013 when Goldman Sachs, Nike and Visa knocked out Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>With news of the upcoming changes, Apple's stock rose $2.55, or two per cent, to $128.99 in early trading on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple holds a market capitalization of about $736 billion, making it the largest publicly traded company in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>AT&T, by contrast, has a market value of $176.5 billion.</td></tr>
