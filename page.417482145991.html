<tr><td>4</td><td>- Michel Platini, president of European soccer federation UEFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"A good day for FIFA and for football ... Change is finally coming. I said on Friday that the day would come sooner or later. Here it is!

<tr><td>8</td><td>"We highly respect this decision of President Blatter to step down and to initiate the necessary reforms - and to make way for a new leadership of FIFA to drive these changes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>- IOC President Thomas Bach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He says he won't step down until the next president is elected. If there is no specific reason (for his resignation) there is no need for him to step down. I think there is an obligation to explain this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>- FIFA Executive Committee member and Japan Football Association vice-president Kozo Tashima.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We are at an important moment for the game, a moment that we must not squander. CONCACAF stands ready to assist in the process of rebuilding FIFA in a way that strengthens the game for many years to come."</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>"I was kind of expecting that the pressures - the external pressures - would be sustained, and therefore Mr. Blatter would soon have to retreat. Because he should."</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>Michel Platini "suits the role of president of FIFA better than anyone else ... (He is) a more prepared and experienced person."</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>- British Culture Secretary John Whittingdale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"As I announced following the election at FIFA Congress, I simply could not countenance serving on the FIFA Executive Committee alongside Mr. Blatter. I respect his decision but am pleased he is standing aside and by the clear determination for real change within FIFA. This in turn allows me to reconsider my position."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>- English FA Vice Chairman David Gill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"His fall will come as a tsunami to every corrupt leader in the confederations around the world. ... We need the corrupt ones in prison, and we need the contributions from great idols, good sports leaders and football lovers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>- Former Brazil great Romario.</td></tr>
