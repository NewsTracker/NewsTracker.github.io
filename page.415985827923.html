<tr><td>11</td><td>Muhaqiq said the two prominent Islamic militants had simply "changed their white flag" of the Taliban for the black IS flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Afghan security forces had launched an operation to find the Hazaras in the week after the kidnappings, Mohaqiq said, but the effort failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The men have now been split up into groups of three or four and were being held in different areas of the mountainous province, Mohaqiq said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As far as he knew, they were still alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Hazaras were abducted from two vehicles on a major road in Zabul province by men described by officials at the time as wearing black clothing and black masks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The armed kidnappers separated the men and boys from women, children and non-Hazaras in the vehicles.</td></tr>
