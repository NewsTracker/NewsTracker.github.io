<h3>Aid agencies to begin helicopter flights to cyclone-stricken Vanuatu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A boy named Samuel kicks a ball as his father Phillip searches through the ruins of their home which was destroyed by Cyclone Pam in Port Vila, Vanuatu March 16, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>PORT VILA (Reuters) - International aid agencies are preparing to begin emergency helicopter flights on Tuesday to the remote outer islands of Vanuatu, which they fear have been devastated by a monster cyclone that tore through the South Pacific island country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Disaster management officials and relief workers are still struggling to establish contact with the islands that bore the brunt of Cyclone Pam's winds of more than 300 kph (185 mph) on Friday and Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The cyclone killed at least 24 people and left some 3,300 people homeless after it destroyed homes, flattened buildings and washed away roads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Officials anticipate that number will rise once they are able to land on the outer islands of the scattered archipelago to inspect the damage there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We have no contact of any sort with the outer islands, the priority is to get communications up and running. It's very, very concerning that we haven't heard anything from the outlying islands," Joe Lowry, a spokesman for International Organisation for Migration (ILM), told Reuters in Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If the devastation is as high as we think it is on those islands, there is a chance that the death toll will go up very significantly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Aid agencies and rescue teams from Australia and New Zealand have flown over the islands, but have so far been unable to land because of flooding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The helicopters will be able to land on higher ground, giving rescue workers a clearer picture of the overall impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Australian Red Cross said it had reports of "total devastation" on the southern island of Tanna, with most homes destroyed and at least two people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tanna, about 200 km (125 miles) south of the capital with its 29,000 inhabitants took the full force of the category 5 storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Reports from aid groups also said the main town on the island of Erromango, north of Tanna, had suffered similar destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In Port Vila, the clean-up was beginning, but there were worries about starvation after the main local food market was destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The majority of locals rely on foods sold at the downtown market such as taro, island cabbage, bananas, kumala and yams for their staple diet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Shops selling tinned food were open and stocked in the capital, but most locals do not have the money to buy those foods and many were reported scavenging for bananas or fruit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We have bread for the first time today because the bakery has opened," said shop owner Colette Calvo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We have water but the situation is very bad because people don't have local food," Calvo added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"All they can eat is food like bananas that they pick up off the ground and they can get sick."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Red Cross Vanuatu CEO Jacqueline de Gaillarde said shops were already low on supplies because people had stockpiled food before the storm but those supplies were then lost when homes were destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Diseases, including dengue fever and malaria, were a concern amid widespread flooding, she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Central Port Vila was relatively unscathed with most of the concrete buildings still standing, but as much of three-quarters of the capital's houses were reported destroyed or severely damaged after seas surged as high as 8 meters (26 feet).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Long queues formed at petrol stations, with many people lining up for hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew had been imposed in the capital to prevent looting, said Colin Collett van Rooyen, Oxfam's country manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Formerly known as the New Hebrides, Vanuatu is a sprawling cluster of more than 80 islands and 260,000 people, 2,000 km (1,250 miles) northeast of the Australian city of Brisbane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Military flights from New Zealand and Australia were bringing in water, sanitation kits, medicines and temporary shelters for the estimated 10,000 made homeless on the main island, with supplies being unloaded late into Monday evening at the airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>France and the United States were also sending aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Commercial flights resumed on Monday, bringing in more aid and evacuating tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>President Baldwin Lonsdale, who had been in Japan for a United Nations disaster conference when the storm hit, said it would take time for his country to recover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"What is happening now is that, as I've seen over and over again, the people of the republic of Vanuatu need humanitarian assistance at the moment," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"And I'm very pleased with the international community that they have responded to my appeal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Aid officials said the storm was comparable in strength to Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people.</td></tr>

<h3>Gus Poyet was glad to be sacked by Sunderland... he angled for moves to West Ham and Crystal Palace after falling out with sporting director Lee Congerton</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For while Gus Poyet may have vowed to fight on in the wake of Saturday's 4-0 humiliation at home to Aston Villa, Monday's dismissal as head coach of Sunderland would have come as a mighty relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Poyet has long since lost faith in his vision for Sunderland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Frustrated by the influence of sporting director Lee Congerton in transfers, he was left with a dysfunctional team made up of players signed by both himself and the club hierarchy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They lost to Manchester City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some of Poyet's press-conference outbursts distanced him from the personnel on the pitch and were not well received at boardroom level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'I am not going to be a head coach when it suits and a manager when it doesn't,' he said in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Such comments would not have been tolerated at other clubs and Congerton informed owner Ellis Short that Poyet was not the man to take them forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Poyet grew particularly disillusioned during January and when he let coach Charlie Oatway take a pre-match and half-time team talk there was a feeling he had lost interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Subsequent team selections left players and senior figures baffled - four central midfielders named in the starting XI versus Hull, who play with wing-backs, being the most alarming example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But the players should not escape criticism, either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>This is the third manager, following Martin O'Neill and Paolo Di Canio, who has been sacked with the core of the current squad on the books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They have fought relegation during the past two seasons and have survived despite falling short of 40 points on each occasion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The squad has gone stale and so had Poyet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He did not think the players were good enough to implement the attractive football he craved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Certainly, not once was there any evidence of such a brand of play during his 17 months in charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tellingly, the Uruguayan also advised his son Diego to sign for West Ham last July rather than join him at the Stadium of Light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Then there was his failure to promote from within the club's academy, a major source of contention among staff who work with the youngsters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Indeed, they were miffed at the sight of assistant boss Mauricio Taricco joining in first-team sessions rather than sending for one of their players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But Poyet's refusal to entertain academy prospects - not one such player started a game during his tenure - was symptomatic of his loss of love for the project on Wearside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Results, if not performances, were always just enough - 14 draws this season - to keep talk of a crisis in the background.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But discord and discontent rumbled all the while and only now is it all being laid bare after the situation unravelled on the pitch in such shambolic fashion at the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Poyet's behaviour in the dressing-room on Saturday did little to convince the players he was scrapping for his and their survival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>For Poyet no longer wanted to be at the club and the key powerbrokers no longer wanted him there, either.</td></tr>
