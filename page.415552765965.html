<h3>Tunisia terrorist attack: Tunisian forces free all hostages from national museum in Tunis after attack leaves 11 dead</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tunis: Gunmen in military uniforms have stormed Tunisia's national museum, killing 19 people, including an Australian, on Wednesday in one of the worst militant attacks in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The dead included 17 foreigners, including people from Japan, Italy, Colombia, France, Poland and Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The toll was revised downward from an earlier figure of 20 in what Prime Minister Habib Essid said was the definitive toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Security forces secure the area after gunmen attacked Tunis' famed Bardo Museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Essid said the two gunmen had been killed in a police assault and authorities were hunting for possible accomplices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Essid said the gunmen, dressed in military uniforms, opened fire on the tourists as they got off a bus to visit the Bardo Museum, and chased them inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Eight people were killed as they got off the bus, an Interior Ministry spokesman said; 10 more were taken hostage and then killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A victim is evacuated outside the Bardo Musum in Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>State television reported that a Tunisian museum guard was injured and died later of his wounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They just started opening fire on the tourists as they were getting out of the buses ... I couldn't see anything except blood and the dead," the driver of a tourist coach said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Security forces later advanced into the museum and killed two gunmen in a firefight, state television reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tourists and visitors from the Bardo Museum are evacuated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>European Union Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini said Islamic State militants, who have become particularly active in neighbouring Libya, were behind the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The EU is determined to mobilise all the tools it has to fully support Tunisia in the fight against terrorism," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However no group had claimed responsibility for the attack by early evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An Interior Ministry spokesman said that the gunmen had probably been Tunisians, but their nationality had not been confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Rescue workers move an empty stretcher towards the museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tunisian officials said it was possible that the Parliament, rather than the museum, was the original intended target of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>President Beji Caid Essebsi denounced the killings as a "horrible crime" and said steps were being taken to prevent any further attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Essid declared in a national address: "All Tunisians should be united after this attack, which was aimed at destroying the Tunisian economy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tunisian security forces secure the area after gunmen attacked the Bardo Museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tunisian authorities said mid-afternoon that the operation to retake the museum was continuing and was nearly complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The attack began at a time when hundreds of visitors were on their way into the museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Interior Ministry officials said the gunmen were armed with grenades and assault rifles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Gunfire was first heard about 12.30pm local time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Helicopters buzzed over the area in the afternoon, and Tunisian state television said they were evacuating people from the area, possibly including those injured in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The attack on such a high-profile target is a blow for the small North African country that relies heavily on European tourism and has largely avoided major militant violence since its 2011 uprising to oust autocrat president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Tunisia's uprising inspired "Arab Spring" revolts in neighbouring Libya and in Egypt, Syria and Yemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Several Islamist militant groups have emerged in Tunisia since the uprising and authorities estimate about 3000 Tunisians have also joined fighters in Iraq and Syria - raising fears they could return and mount attacks at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Many Italians were in the area when the attack took place, the Italian foreign ministry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A large cruise ship was docked in Tunis on Wednesday, and a number of its 3100 passengers had gone ashore planning to visit the museum, a spokesman for the cruise line said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Piero Fassino, the mayor of Turin, told Italian television that six City Hall workers were there, but that only two had been heard from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Wednesday's assault was the worst attack involving foreigners in Tunisia since an al-Qaeda suicide bombing on a synagogue killed 21 people on the tourist island of Djerba in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The museum is a leading tourist attraction that chronicles Tunisia's history and houses one of the world's largest collections of Roman mosaics.</td></tr>
