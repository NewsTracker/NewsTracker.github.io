<h3>Hillary Clinton 'never signed statement when she left State Department'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>'We have reviewed Secretary Clinton's official personnel file and administrative files, and do not have any record of her signing the OF-109,' Psaki said, referring to the form's bureaucratic name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Psaki said there was no sign of such a statement in department files.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'We're fairly certain she didn't sign one,' she told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Asked if the State Department considered the case closed, Psaki snapped: 'I hope so, There's quite a bit going on in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On the Fox News Channel on Monday, legal commentator and former judge Andrew Napolitano opined that Clinton was between a rock and a hard place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And if not, Napolitano added, she was likely guilty of stealing public records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Either could be a felony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Psaki emphasized that different bureaus within the department had different rules relating to such statements that had the effect of making it optional for some employs to fill them out and turn them in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She could not identify the bureaus in which employees had such a choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Questions about whether Clinton signed such a document have swirled since the revelation of her use of a personal email account for government-related work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Republicans, among others, have said that the State Department, along with other federal agencies, generally requires outgoing employees to turn over job-related materials before leaving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That policy requires employees to sign the separation statements declaring they had 'surrendered to responsible officials all unclassified documents' related to official business during their employment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Providing incorrect information on the form can be grounds for prosecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Republican National Committee earlier Tuesday had submitted two Freedom of Information requests to the State Department seeking copies of the 'separation statements' signed by Clinton and her top aides and related records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Others have said it would be equally troubling if Clinton did not sign the form because that would have meant she would was holding herself to a different standard than other employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Psaki will be in her just just a few more weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Her next posting will be at the Whtie House, where she will take over as communications director.</td></tr>
