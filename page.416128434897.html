<tr><td>4</td><td>Analysts are waiting to see how well the watch will sell beyond devoted Apple fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple has a better chance at succeeding than any other smartwatch maker so far, yet it will likely take time before sales reach the kind of numbers that Apple gets for iPhones and iPads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Watch prices start at $349, but can go as high as $17,000 for a luxury edition in gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>People can try the watch on in Apple stores, but for now all orders are being handled online.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>It's available in the U.S. and eight other markets around the world.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>In some countries, select department stores and resellers also have it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In London's Covent Garden, a tourist hotspot, a buzz was growing in the Apple flagship store as dozens of fans came to check out the new gadget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some crouched over glass counters to play with sample watches, while others who had pre-booked appointments got to try them on their wrists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I've been waiting for this for a long time," said Carl Walsh, a 43-year-old company director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's beautifully developed, but I'll probably want to wait a bit and see what people say about the battery life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Regy Selsaas, 42, came to see if the watch would make a good gift for his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It's more like a gadget than a phone," he said, wincing at the high price tag of the luxury version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's really beautiful but expensive. I'm not 100 percent convinced."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jay Carroll, 15, needed no persuading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He and his mother Sarah had placed an online order first thing Friday, but the two still wanted to try it out in store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I'm looking forward to just having it there on my wrist, so I can be on my phone all the time," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The curious in Japan formed a long line in Isetan department store, where a special section was built just for the Apple watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Only 20 customers were allowed in at a time, and only those with advance reservations or who showed up early enough to get one of 76 lottery tickets got to try the watch on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The rest could only look at a display of 19 watches under a glass showcase.</td></tr>

<tr><td>28</td><td>He has just traded up from an iPhone 4 to the new iPhone 6 Plus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>China was among countries where the watch had its global debut Friday, reflecting the country's fast-growing status as one of Apple's most important markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Li said he planned to buy the sport version of the watch at about 3,000 yuan ($500).</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I cannot do sports with the mobile phone," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I need a machine to record what I did and a screen to look at."</td></tr>
