<h3>Blues all out for 407 v WA in Shield</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Now he needs his bowlers to deliver and the rain to hold off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NSW made 407 on day two and have WA 1-55 at stumps after rain drew play to a close early for the second straight day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cameron Bancroft (29) and Michael Klinger (19) are at the crease for the Warriors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Henriques is backing his bowling attack of Doug Bollinger, Gurinder Sandhu, Sean Abbott, Steve O'Keefe and Nathan Lyon to take the 19 wickets NSW require as long as the weather allows it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is frustrating, but it's something we can't control. We still have two long days ahead with 112 overs each, and if we bowl well enough we are still a chance," Henriques said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We'll come up with different plans for different batters, but most importantly it's about discipline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Henriques returned from a groin injury for the match and made 145 with 18 boundaries and two towering sixes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The skipper is hoping his bowling isn't required now as the Blues look to have a chance to defend last year's Shield title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I should be alright to bowl but with the three quicks that we have and two spinners I think I'll only be needed when times are getting really tough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>NSW need to win outright to make the Shield final, while a draw will be enough to see Western Australia through.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt Reveals Grand Plan To Build New Capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt has unveiled its plan to build a new administrative and business capital that will house five million people and feature a theme park "four times bigger than Disneyland".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Housing minister Mustafa Kamel Madbuli said the new 70,000 acre city, east of Cairo, would take five to seven years to build at a cost of $45bn ( 30bn).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Details on how it would be funded were not revealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The idea to build the new city originated from our awareness that Cairo's current population (18 million) will double in the next 40 years," Mr Madbuli said at a conference showcasing the details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The proposed city would have "large green spaces, an international airport, a theme park four times bigger than Disneyland in California, 90 square kilometres of solar farms, and an electric train" to link with Cairo, Mr Madbuli said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The plan for the new city was first announced in the summer of last year, but further details were kept under wraps until now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>President Abdel Fattah al Sisi is hoping the plan will help kick-start Egypt's troubled economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr al Sisi, who has positioned himself as a bulwark against Islamic extremists, said investing in the Arab world's most populous country would help stabilise the entire region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Egypt's stability "is a cornerstone in regional stability," he told the conference in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Arab states including Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia pledged $12bn in investment aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry, who was at the gathering, said Washington stood beside Egypt as it seeks to recover from years of turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Kerry, who earlier met Mr al Sisi and the leaders of Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, told businessmen that Washington was "eager and ready and willing" to help Egypt's economic development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But a US diplomat travelling with him said there had been "no decision" on freeing up $650m in military aid frozen during the height of a crackdown on Mr al Sisi's Islamist opponents that left hundreds dead.</td></tr>
