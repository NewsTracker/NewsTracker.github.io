<h3>Hammond ties record, Sens top Canes in OT</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Stone's late goal and a historic performance from Andrew Hammond between the pipes lifted the Senators to their fourth consecutive win and 12th in their past 14 outings (12-1-1) as they make a belated push for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hammond came up with 35 saves, including 18 in the third period and three more in overtime, in the rookie's 12th straight game of allowing three goals or fewer to begin his NHL career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That ties a league record set by Hall of Famer Frank Brimsek in 1938-39.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Anytime a guy can come in and have an old coach coaching, and he sets a record before the coach was even born," Senators head coach Dave Cameron joked of Hammond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"That was (as) great (an) effort as he's had for us. In the last 12, 13 games he's been awesome."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Patrick Wiercioch also tallied a goal for the Senators, with Erik Karlsson assisting on both Ottawa markers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Anton Khudobin finished with 31 saves for Carolina, with Elias Lindholm recording the lone Hurricanes' goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A Hurricanes' turnover in the neutral zone with the game headed towards a shootout led to the game-winner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ottawa's Kyle Turris collected the loose puck and skated around Carolina defenseman Ryan Murphy before slipping a backhanded pass that a trailing Stone deposited to end the defensively dominated contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hammond helped force extra time with a spectacular third period in which the 27-year-old rookie made a number of challenging saves, none tougher than a great glove stop on Jordan Staal with Carolina on a power play early in the frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Khudobin, who registered 15 saves during a second period in which the Senators controlled play, later kept it at 1-1 by robbing Turris on a good chance with 2:33 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hammond's only blemish came with 7:01 to go in the opening period, when a Karlsson giveaway created a 3-on-2 Hurricanes rush that Lindholm finished with a well-placed attempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Khudobin helped kill off a temporary 5-on-3 power play for Ottawa in the second, but Wiercioch one-timed a Karlsson give past the netminder with the Senators still on a man advantage to tie it at 1-1 with 6:38 left in the second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We knew they would push back after the first and we couldn't match their intensity in the second," said Hurricanes forward Jeff Skinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It was a tight third, we had some chances."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hammond is now 11-0-1 with a 1.35 goals against average over 12 starts and one relief appearance this season ... The win was Ottawa's fourth straight on the road, where the Sens have gone 8-0-1 in their last nine ... Ottawa had lost in four straight and 11 of their its 12 visits to Raleigh coming in ... Karlsson has two goals and four assists over his last four games ... Khudobin drew a second straight start with Cam Ward sidelined with an illness.</td></tr>

<h3>Clinton criticizes House GOP budget plan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton blasted a budget proposal released by Republicans on Tuesday, saying on Twitter it "fails Americans" on investments in jobs and economic growth, would cut college aid for students and undermine President Barack Obama's health care law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the second straight day that the former secretary of state turned to social media to criticize Congress, a tactic used extensively by President Barack Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Budgets reflect our priorities. They should help families get ahead, educate our kids, and spark small business growth," Clinton said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She said the "nation's future - jobs & economic growth - depends on investments made today. The GOP budget fails Americans on these principles."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton's Twitter response came hours after Republicans released a $3.8 trillion budget plan in the House that would overhaul the tax code and aims to balance the budget in a decade in tandem with deep cuts in social programs and the repeal of Obama's health care law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The White House said the proposal failed to make investments in education, infrastructure and national defense, setting up a likely budget clash in the months before the next presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton faulted the budget proposal's outlook for education, saying cuts to Pell Grants "hold our kids back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She also warned against another attempt to repeal the health care law, saying it would "let insurers write their own rules again, and wipe out coverage for 16 million Americans."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clinton, who has faced criticism in recent weeks over revelations that she used a private email account at the State Department, has sought to present herself as an above-the-political-fray figure who would overcome Washington gridlock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But she has also ratcheted up criticism of Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Monday, she blasted Senate Republicans for holding up confirmation of Loretta Lynch, Obama's choice to be Attorney General, until the Senate completed a human trafficking bill that was complicated by a provision related to funding for abortions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton called it a "Congressional trifecta against women."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Her approach offers parallels to Democrats' attempt to tarnish 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney with the budget plan that included sharp cuts to social programs developed by Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Paul Ryan, who later became Romney's running mate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It comes as Clinton is formulating policies that will form the foundation of her pitch to Americans, chief among them how to boost wages and create more economic opportunities for Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's a very central part not just of 2015, but 2016: What are the ideas and investments we're going to make to give Americans more economic opportunity," said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.</td></tr>
