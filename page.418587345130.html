<h3>A year after Flight MH17 downed, families want justice</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Soft toys are seen near the crash site of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane (Flight MH17) near the settlement of Grabovo in the Donetsk region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One by one, the names of the 298 passengers and crew who died aboard Malaysia Airline's Flight MH17 will be read aloud by relatives on Friday, a year after the passenger jet was shot out of the sky over rebel-held eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Commemorations in the Netherlands and Ukraine on Friday will mark a painful milestone for the families, some of whom have had to wait until now for scattered remains to be recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We received 19 very small pieces this month," said Silene Fredriksz, whose son Bryce was in the plane with his girlfriend, Daisy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We will never get all of them back, because they have stopped looking, but I cannot wait any longer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Funerals for Bryce and Daisy will be held after the memorial this week, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In Ukraine, the crash site near the village of Hrabove is now marked by flowers and toys brought by locals in memory of the many children who died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"God forbid this happens here again or anywhere else," said Alexander Pereverzev, who lives just 300 metres away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I feel so sorry for the people who died."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The tragedy marked a turning point in the conflict in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian separatist rebels, in which more than 6 500 people have now been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Western governments believe the rebels shot down the plane at cruising altitude with a Russian-supplied BUK missile system a version based on radio intercepts, photographic and video evidence, witness statements and satellite imagery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Russia denies involvement in the Ukrainian conflict, and Moscow and the separatists have suggested the plane was downed with a missile fired from a Ukrainian fighter jet, something Kiev denies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In comments last year, a Russian deputy minister also appeared to allow for the possibility that rebels had shot down MH17 in a failed attempt to hit a Ukrainian military plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dutch authorities have said they are not yet ready to identify culprits, but have called for a UN tribunal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said that would be "counterproductive and premature," putting Moscow directly at odds with the Netherlands, Malaysia, Belgium, Australia and Ukraine, which are part of the criminal inquiry.</td></tr>
