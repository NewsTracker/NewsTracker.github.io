<h3>Kenya's Kenyatta asks Burundian president to postpone poll</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI, May 18 (Reuters) - Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has told Burundi leader Pierre Nkurunziza he should postpone a presidential election due next month after last week's failed military coup, Kenyatta's spokesman said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Manoah Esipisu said the two leaders, whose nations belong to the East African Community (EAC) common market, had spoken by phone on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kenyatta's counterparts in the region shared his view, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Regional leaders want the election date changed from June 26 to create a "conducive environment" but the vote should still be held within the current electoral cycle, which comes to an end in late August, Esipisu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The landlocked east African nation has been plunged into crisis since Nkurunziza pushed for a third term of office, a move his opponents say breaks the constitution and a 2005 peace agreement that ended an ethnically driven civil war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As many as 300,000 people died in the war, and there are fears the current crisis could inflame lingering tensions between the majority Hutu population and the Tutsi minority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>More than 105,000 people have fled to neighbouring states, including Rwanda, which has the same ethnic mix as Burundi and which was torn apart by a genocide in 1994 that killed 800,000 mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</td></tr>
