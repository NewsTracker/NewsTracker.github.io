<h3>Northwestern MutualVoice: Should You Pay Off Your Mortgage Before You Retire?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Should you pay off your mortgage early?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's a question I get a lot, especially from people who are getting close to retirement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>I'm not surprised: Who doesn't dream of the day when they own their house free and clear?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While retiring debt free used to be the goal for many American homeowners, times have changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Today, the number of people who are carrying a mortgage into their golden years is on the rise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Is that a bad thing?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Not necessarily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Let's look at four good reasons not to pay off your mortgage at retirement-and one good reason why you might want to pay it off anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The first reason not to pay off your mortgage early is if it enables you to maximize your retirement plan contributions and take full advantage of any available company match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The years leading up to retirement represent an important chance to stash away money in tax-advantaged accounts-including making any catch-up contributions if you are age 50 or older.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Contributing enough to capture any employer match will help boost your savings even further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Where else are you going to get an immediate 50 percent return on your money, guaranteed?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>(This assumes your employer matches half of every dollar you contribute to the plan.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The second reason to hold onto your mortgage is that there may be better uses for your money, at least for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Given today's low interest rate environment, it may not make sense to make extra payments on your mortgage if you can pay down higher interest rate debt you may have or if you can earn a higher after-tax return on your money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The third reason to keep your mortgage is if it provides a tax advantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>You can usually deduct the interest you pay on a mortgage for your main home if you itemize deductions on your tax return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Generally, mortgage interest payments will reduce your taxable income and, thus, the federal income taxes you owe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But keep in mind, if you take the standard deduction instead (typically because you don't have enough deductions to itemize), there's no tax benefit to the mortgage interest you pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Of course, you'll want to consult with your tax professional for guidance on your specific situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And the fourth reason not to pay off your mortgage?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>You may want the liquidity to meet other needs, including emergencies, general expenses and discretionary spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Using a large chunk of your savings to pay off your mortgage can be a good idea but not if it leaves you "house-rich and cash-poor."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Money tied up in your house may not be as easily accessible to pay unforeseen medical costs or other expenses in retirement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>You'd need to borrow against your home using a home equity line of credit, reverse mortgage or sale of the property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>So when would you want to pay off your mortgage before retirement?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Here's one good reason to pay it off early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>For many people, paying off their mortgage has less to do with math and more to do with peace of mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ask people who have paid off their mortgage, and they'll tell you it feels great.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That, and the fact that eliminating what for many is their largest monthly expense gives them more control over their cash flow in retirement, including the ability to dial spending up or down to meet their needs and wants over time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That doesn't mean paying off your mortgage is a slam-dunk-there are more things to consider than I've covered here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>For this reason, it often makes sense to speak with a financial professional who can help review your options and provide an objective view of whether it makes financial and emotional sense to carry your loan into retirement or pay it off early.</td></tr>

<h3>Tourists killed, others taken hostage in attack on Tunisian parliament, official says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Gunmen opened fire Wednesday at a major museum in Tunisia's capital, killing at least 20 people, mostly foreigners, in one of the worst terrorist attacks in this struggling North African democracy that depends heavily on tourism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Men with assault rifles fired at tourists climbing from buses in front of the National Bardo Museum in central Tunis near the country's parliament, sending dozens sprinting for safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two gunmen were killed, but Prime Minister Habib Essid said a manhunt was on for at two or three others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Security forces immediately flooded the area, and Tunisia's parliament building, where deputies were debating the new anti-terrorism law, was evacuated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dozens of tourists scrambled from the museum holding hands or linking arms as security forces pointed their guns toward an adjacent building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many elderly people, apparently tourists, ran in panic to safety, including at least one couple carrying two children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tunisia has been struggled to keep extremist violence at bay since the overthrow of its dictator in 2011, and the attack was the worst on a tourist site since an al-Qaida car bomb killed 21 people - mostly Germans - in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Our nation is in danger," Essid warned in an address on national television Wednesday evening after the siege ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We will be merciless in the defence of our country," he added, describing the attack as an unprecedented assault on Tunisia's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He promised increased security in tourist zones and asked residents to be extra alert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>According to Essid, the dead include two gunmen, a Tunisian security officer and a Tunisian cleaning woman, while the rest were tourists from Italy, Poland, Germany and Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Spanish Foreign Ministry has confirmed one dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Several other people were reported wounded in the attack, including three Poles and at least two Italians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Italian Foreign Ministry said 100 other Italians had been taken to a secure location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some of the Italians at the museum were believed to have been passengers aboard the Costa Fascinosa, a cruise liner that had docked in Tunis while on a seven-day tour of the western Mediterranean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ship owner Costa Crociere confirmed that some of its 3,161 passengers were visiting the capital and that a Bardo tour was on the itinerary, but said it couldn't confirm how many passengers were in the museum at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The attack was a strong blow to Tunisia's efforts to revive its crucial tourism industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Bardo, built in a 15th century palace, is the largest museum in Tunisia and houses one of the world's largest collections of Roman mosaics among its 8,000 works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The museum, 4 kilometres (2 1/2 miles) from the city centre, has a new wing with contemporary architecture that was built as part of a 2009 renovation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>During the Roman Empire, Tunisia was called the province of Africa and was home to several large cities which are now popular ruins, including the great amphitheatre of El Djem, the ruins of Sbeitla and in the north, Dougga, known by UNESCO as the "best preserved small town in North Africa."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"It is not by chance that today's terrorism affects a country that represents hope for the Arab world. The hope for peace, the hope for stability, the hope for democracy. This hope must live," French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in a statement minutes after the crisis ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Speaking at the Louvre museum to call for international efforts to preserve the heritage of Iraq and Syria against extremist destruction, French President Francois Hollande said he had called Tunisia's president to offer support and solidarity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Each time a terrorist crime is committed, we are all concerned," Hollande said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Tunisia recently completed a rocky road to democracy after overthrowing its authoritarian president in 2011, seen by many as the start of the so-called Arab Spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The country has been more stable than others in the region, but has struggled with violence by Islamic extremists that have sworn allegiance to both al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A disproportionately large number of Tunisian recruits - some 3,000, according to government estimates - have joined Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The U.S. Embassy in Tunis was attacked in September 2012, seriously damaging the embassy grounds and an adjoining American school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Four of the assailants were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Overall, though, violence in Tunisia in recent years has been largely focused on security forces, not foreigners or tourist sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In October 2013, a young man blew himself up on a beach in the coastal town of Sousse after being chased from a hotel, causing many to expect a new wave of attacks on tourism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>None materialized until now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>North Africa analyst Geoff Porter said an attack on a tourism site has long been expected as the militants come under pressure from increasingly effective Tunisian security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Today's attack did not come out of nowhere. In fact, it comes amid ongoing counterterrorism efforts elsewhere in the country," he said about the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Increasing pressure on terrorist activities ... may have squeezed the balloon, with terrorists seeking softer targets with more symbolic impact in the capital."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The attack came the day after Tunisian security officials confirmed the death in neighbouring Libya of Ahmed Rouissi, leading suspect in Tunisian terror attacks and in the killings of two opposition figures in Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Rouissi had become a field commander for the Islamic State in Libya and died fighting near the town of Sirte, highlighting how Libya has increasingly become a sanctuary for Tunisian radicals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Tunisia has repeatedly expressed concern over the security threat from Libya, where central government has broken down since the 2011 ouster of Moammar Gadhafi and is now run by competing militias.</td></tr>
