<h3>Decision due in Bali Nine death row appeal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have lost their final chance at being spared execution, and Indonesia won't respect any fresh legal action for the Australians, the attorney-general says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>HM Prasetyo had vowed to wait for 10 death row prisoners to exhaust their legal options before setting a date for their mass execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The state administrative court on Monday rejected an appeal for the Bali Nine pair, upholding its earlier decision that presidential clemency isn't within its jurisdiction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lawyers for the men now plan to challenge the constitutional court to outline the president's obligations in clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They argue the executions should be stayed pending the new action, to be filed this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Mr Prasetyo says he won't wait for another court challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"No, there shall be no more (delays)," he said after Monday's verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is proof of their tendency to delay ... it's like toying with law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The attorney-general argued clemency was a matter of presidential prerogative only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Australians' lawyers have argued that President Joko Widodo erred by rejecting their clemency on the basis they were drug offenders, without considering their rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"After 10 years, this has been a successful rehabilitation program and it's very regretful if in the end, they must die," he told reporters after the verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The federal government has also asked that new legal options be allowed to run their course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the government was disappointed by the court verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Both men have undergone extensive rehabilitation and I will continue to make representations to my counterpart, just as Australia will continue to use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution," Ms Bishop said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Again, the Australian government respectfully requests the president to review their pleas for clemency."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It's believed the constitutional review request on clemency would be the first of its kind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The administrative court action was also unusual, having only been attempted once before and lost - a precedent raised in the judges' reasoning on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The administrative court had rejected the Bali Nine pair's challenge in February, determining the decrees by Mr Joko were not within its jurisdiction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran await execution in semi-isolation conditions on Nusakambangan, a penal island in Central Java.</td></tr>
