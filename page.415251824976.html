<h3>Apple to Replace AT&T in Dow Jones Industrial Average</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>S&P Dow Jones Indices said the switch will take place after the close of trading on Wednesday, March 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple will start trading as part of the 30-stock Dow at the opening of trading the following day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>S&P Dow Jones Indices said it's making the move in response to a planned stock split for Visa, another member of the 119-year old barometer of the stock market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After its four-to-one stock split, Visa will wind up with a lower price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>S&P said that would reduce the weight of the information technology sector in the Dow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Adding Apple will help balance out this reduction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Unlike other stock market measures, the Dow weighs members by their prices, so a large change in the price of one stock can have a big effect on the overall index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>S&P said swapping Apple for AT&T won't alter the Dow's level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The last big shake-up came in September 2013 when Goldman Sachs, Nike and Visa knocked out Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple's stock rose $2.55, or 2 percent, to $128.99 in early trading on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>AT&T sank 46 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $33.54.</td></tr>
