<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu promises no Palestinian state if he is re-elected</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Netanyahu, looking to shore up support from his hard-line base ahead of the Tuesday vote, made the comment in a videotaped interview posted Monday on the nrg news website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The latest opinion polls have shown Netanyahu's Likud Party trailing Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union, with momentum shifting away from Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Herzog has confidently predicted an "upheaval" was imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think that whoever today moves to establish a Palestinian state and withdraw from territory is giving attack territory for Islamic extremists against the state of Israel," Netanyahu told nrg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Whoever ignores that is burying his head in the sand. The left is doing that, burying its head in the sand time after time," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When asked if that means a Palestinian state will not be established if he is elected, Netanyahu said "indeed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Islamic militant group Hamas took over two years later and escalated their attacks on Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The election, called by Netanyahu in December two years ahead of schedule, is widely seen as a referendum on the Israeli leader - who has governed the country for the past six years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While Netanyahu could still end up in the best position to cobble together a ruling coalition, the slipping support has rattled Likud - which began the campaign all but assured that it would stay in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In recent days Likud has been on a get-out-the-vote blitz, with Netanyahu stepping up his nationalist rhetoric, saying a dovish government would spell disaster for the country and complaining of an international conspiracy to oust him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Netanyahu, who rarely speaks to the media, has given a series of interviews to Israeli media in recent days and on Sunday night, he addressed an outdoor rally before tens of thousands of hard-line supporters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On his final day of campaigning Monday, Netanyahu visited Har Homa, a Jewish development in east Jerusalem that is viewed as an illegal settlement by the Palestinians and the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as their capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We will preserve Jerusalem's unity in all its parts. We will continue to build and fortify Jerusalem so that its division won't be possible and it will stay united forever," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Likud's victory is the only thing that can ensure the continuation of a national leadership and will prevent the establishment of a left-wing government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Herzog has been surging in the polls on a campaign that promises to repair ties with the Palestinians and the international community and also bring relief to the country's struggling middle class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Visiting his party headquarters, an upbeat Herzog talked about a "crucial" vote for the country and warned against splitting the anti-Netanyahu vote among the various centrist parties, including charismatic leader Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Whoever wants Lapid, whoever wants Yesh Atid, in the government has to vote for us. They have no other choice," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Whoever wants an upheaval has to vote for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Lapid himself got a warm welcome in the coastal city of Netanya, where people stopped him in the street to take selfies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He accused both Netanyahu and Herzog of working outside deals with special interest groups and said that only he was tackling the real issues facing the Israeli middle class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Lapid has so far refused to commit to either Herzog or Netanyahu, though he is widely seen as a logical ally of Herzog's in a future coalition.</td></tr>

<h3>Argentina's very own Naked Chef takes it to a whole new level?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 24-year-old cook, known as Jenn to her fans, offers very simple recipes compared to the creations of Jamie Oliver, but nevertheless she has managed to build up a huge fan base with a series of YouTube videos offering 'quick and simple recipes'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She said: 'I had a male friend who only ever wanted to eat fast food, and it's a problem many men have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But I want to show them that cooking is fun and to encourage more men to get involved in learning about recipes and preparation of food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The 24-year-old is from San Isidro in the east Argentine province of Buenos Aires, and her channel A Fuego Maximo - Maximum Fire - includes recipes such as how to make sausages wrapped in empanadas and slices of cheddar cheese.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Although it is a topless show Jenn makes sure that the food covers her assets in order not to break YouTube rules on nudity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The programmer, who has an interest in amateur theatre, is now seriously considering a career as a presenter after building up a huge fan base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And although the recipes usually work first time, the only difficulty she ever has is in the camera angles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She says: 'Sometimes we have to make sure we film the same scene a dozen times just to make sure everything is properly covered by food so that we don't breach YouTube rules on nudity.</td></tr>
