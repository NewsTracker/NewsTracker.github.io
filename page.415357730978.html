<h3>Greece says Germany owes it compensation for WWII occupation</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) " The radical left-led Greek government insisted Tuesday that the debt-ridden country has never been fully compensated by Germany for its brutal World War II Nazi occupation, linking the issue with Greece's fraught bailout negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said a 1960 reparation deal with Germany did not cover key Greek demands, including payments for wrecked infrastructure, war crimes and the return of a forced loan exacted from occupied Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Germany has repeatedly rejected previous approaches from Athens on further reparations, saying the question was settled by existing agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Relations between the two countries have soured considerably since Greece's acute financial crisis broke out in late 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Germany is a major contributor to the international rescue loans that have kept Greece afloat since 2010, and has been a keen proponent of the resented budget and income cuts demanded in exchange to rebuild the country's shattered finances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tsipras told parliament that Greece will honor its obligations to bailout creditors, including Germany, but won't "abandon its irrevocable demands" for World War II reparations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His six-week-old government is trying to ease the terms of its rescue loan program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We are not giving lessons in morality, but we will not accept lessons in morality either," Tsipras said during a debate on reviving a special parliamentary committee on demanding German war reparations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are prepared to offer every political and legal assistance to ensure that this committee's efforts bear fruit," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Greece has not specified how much compensation it could demand from Germany, and the results of an official report into the issue last year remain classified.</td></tr>
