<h3>Blatter announces resignation as FIFA president</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Zurich, Switzerland (SportsNetwork.com) - Sepp Blatter announced on Tuesday he will resign as president of FIFA, world soccer's governing body, amidst a corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blatter, 79, was elected to a fifth term as president last Friday after challenger Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein of Jordan conceded the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At the helm of the organization since 1998, things were turned upside down for Blatter and FIFA last Wednesday when nine high-ranking FIFA officials were arrested by United States and Swiss authorities on charges of corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I have thoroughly considered my presidency and thought about my presidency. The last 40 years of my life, these years were closely related to FIFA and this wonderful sport of football," Blatter said in his address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I appreciate and love FIFA more than anything else and I only want to do the best for football and FIFA. I had decided to stand again to be elected because I was convinced it would be the best option for football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The election has closed but the challenges that FIFA is facing have not come to an end. FIFA needs profound restructuring. Although the members of FIFA have given me the mandate and re-elected my presidency. This mandate doesn't seem to be supported by everyone in the world of football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is why I will call an extraordinary congress and put at disposal my function. It is going to be held as soon as possible and a new president will be elected to follow me. I will continue to exercise my function as president of FIFA until the new elections will be held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I am very much linked to FIFA and its interests. Those interests are dear to me and this is why I am taking this decision. I would like to thank those who have always supported me in a constructive and loyal manner as president of FIFA and who have done so much for the game that we all love. What matters to me more than anything is that when all of this is over, football is the winner."</td></tr>
