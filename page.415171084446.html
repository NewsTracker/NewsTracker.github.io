<h3>Nigeria?s Boko Haram releases beheading video echoing Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nigeria's Islamist sect Boko Haram released a video purporting to show it beheading two men, its first online posting using advanced graphics and editing techniques reminiscent of footage from Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The film, released on Monday, shows militants standing behind the two men who are on their knees, their hands tied behind their backs, with one man standing over them, holding a knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One of the men is made to tell the camera that they had been paid by authorities to spy on the militant group, before the film moves to another scene showing their decapitated bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was not possible to confirm the film's authenticity or date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The footage will stoke concerns that Boko Haram, which evolved out of a clerical movement focused on northeast Nigeria, is expanding its scope and seeking inspiration from global militant networks including al Qaeda and Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The militants who have killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in their bid to carve out an Islamist state in their homeland, have in recent months stepped up cross-border raids into Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan has said Boko Haram is allied to both al Qaeda and its offshoot Islamic State, though that has not been confirmed by the group itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Boko Haram film's use of graphics, the footage of black-clad militants with a black flag, and the editing to show only the aftermath of the beheading, were particularly reminiscent of footage from Islamic state, which has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria and killed several hostages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the film, one of the men says he comes from Baga in Borno state, and the other says he is from Michika in Adamawa state, both areas where the army says it has recently recaptured territory from Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Past Boko Haram films have been much cruder affairs, often featuring a man identified as leader Abubakar Shekau talking more about local gripes than global jihad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A number of recent releases have included much more gruesome footage of beheadings.</td></tr>

<h3>Kerry working on Iran nuke deal, Netanyahu to criticize it</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kerry discussed ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, and tensions with Russia over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MONTREUX, Switzerland (AP) - As senior U.S. and Iranian officials worked in Switzerland Tuesday to reach a nuclear deal, Israel's leader warned against reaching an accommodation with Tehran, declaring to the U.S. Congress that Tehran aims for Mideast dominance and won't let any such pact thwart its plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The negotiations, being led by Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, have less than a month to go to meet a late-March deadline for a pact meant to crimp Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But even as the two sides met in a luxury hotel in the Swiss resort town of Montreaux, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was making his case against their slowly emerging agreement 4,090 miles (6,500 kilometers) away in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead of depriving Tehran of the means to make nuclear arms, the deal being negotiated "would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them," by leaving much of Iran's nuclear infrastructure intact, Netanyahu told the joint houses of Congress, in a 40-minute speech frequently interrupted by standing ovations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a sign that Netanyahu's speech was resonating outside Washington, Zarif decried comments that President Barack Obama made on Monday - as part of an administration-wide effort to push back on the Israeli's criticism - in which he said that Iran would have to suspend its nuclear activities for at least a decade as part of any final agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Zarif, in a statement quoted by Iran's official news agency IRNA, said Obama's remarks were "unacceptable and threatening," aimed at attracting U.S. public opinion while reacting to Netanyahu "and other extremist opponents of the talks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The U.S. and Iranian sides met for two hours on Tuesday morning before taking a break, according to U.S. officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The officials said earlier they expected the talks would resume and likely continue through Netanyahu's address to Congress, delivered in the late afternoon local time in Montreux.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We're working away, productively," Kerry told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are moving and we are talking to be able to make progress," Zarif said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There are issues and we want to address them. But there is a seriousness that we need to move forward. As we have said all along, we need the necessary political will to understand that the only way to move forward is to negotiate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The U.S., Iran and other world powers are racing to meet the end-of-March target to reach the outline of deal, with a July deadline for a final agreement.</td></tr>
