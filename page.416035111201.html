<h3>FBI investigating 2 attacks with alleged Ferguson references</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Both attacks happened in March, one involving a white victim and black attackers, the other a black victim attacked by a white man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The suspects in both cases allegedly made references to Ferguson, the St. Louis suburb at the center of racial strife since a white police officer in August fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FBI spokeswoman Rebecca Wu said the agency is looking into both cases for possible hate crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Anyone found guilty of a federal hate crime involving bodily injury could face up to 10 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Investigators allege that Ford, 54, was punched by James Street at a convenience store on March 25 in Fenton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Police said Street, who is white, shouted racial slurs and told Ford, who is black, "Go back to Ferguson."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ford, who played for the Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies from 1985 to 1990, said he was punched without warning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 37-year-old Street is charged with third-degree assault motivated by discrimination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He is free on bond but couldn't be reached for comment Monday; he doesn't have a listed phone number or an attorney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The other attack - captured on cellphone video posted on social media sites - happened March 23, on a MetroLink light rail train in St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The victim, a 45-year-old white man, told police he declined a young black man's request to use his cellphone before the young man asked what he thought about "the Mike Brown situation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The victim answered that he hadn't given it much thought, and the young man repeatedly punched him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ronald Williams, 20, who is black, was charged with a misdemeanor in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Williams' attorney didn't return a message seeking comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A juvenile also was arrested in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>State hate-crime charges weren't sought in the light-rail attack because there wasn't enough evidence to prove that the attack involved racial or religious motivations, said Lauren Trager, spokeswoman for St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce.</td></tr>
