<h3>Islamic State militants claim suicide attacks in Libya that kill 40</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cairo: Militants pledging allegiance to the Islamic State have claimed responsibility for three car bombs that killed at least 42 people in a town in eastern Libya in the latest escalation in a surge of violence linked to the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attacks, in the town of Qubbah, appeared to be one more turn in a cycle of retaliation that began when IS militants released a video last week showing its fighters in western Libya beheading more than a dozen kidnapped Egyptian Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The government of Egypt responded with air strikes on the city of Derna, a hub of Islamist militancy in eastern Libya where another group of fighters has pledged loyalty to IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An Egyptian air force fighter jet lands at an undisclosed location in Egypt following air strikes in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Friday, the IS branch in Derna claimed responsibility for the latest bombings "in revenge for the bloodshed of Muslims" in the city, according to a Twitter message linked to the group and reported by Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Other Twitter messages from the group claimed to identify two of its "martyrs" who died in the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The three blasts targeted a busy petrol station, a security building and the home of the speaker of the country's internationally recognised parliament, local media and Libya's health minister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Eight of those killed in Qubbah were Egyptians who had come to Libya for work, according to Mohamed Tumi, a spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Other news reports put the death toll at about 40 and reported that three or four Egyptians were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As many as 70 others were injured, according to several reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Twenty-one Egyptian Christians in orange jumpsuits appear in an Islamic State video being marched by IS militants along a beach, said to be near Tripoli, before each captive is beheaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>IS and other militants groups have sought to take advantage of the chaos that followed the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 to plant their flags and stake out new bases of operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The broader Libya bedlam has now degenerated into a stalemate between two coalitions of armed groups, each of which claims its own competing national government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Qubbah is in an area under the nominal authority of Libya's internationally recognised government, which has relocated to the nearby cities of Tobruk and Bayda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The town is in territory considered to be under the de facto control of General Khalifa Hifter, who last year announced a military takeover to end what he portrayed as the Islamist dominance of a previous parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The internationally recognised government, formed by a newer parliament, has sought to legitimise General Hifter and put itself under his protection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tripoli, the nominal capital, is under the control of the rival coalition, Libya Dawn, which includes moderate and extremist Islamists as well as ethnic Berbers and the powerful militia from the coastal city of Misurata.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The United Nations Support Mission in Libya said it "strongly deplores" the attacks, calling them "cowardly acts".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But it also urged Libya's feuding political factions to unite as the "best response to counterterrorism and violence".</td></tr>
