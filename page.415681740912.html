<h3>Gareth Bale's car attacked by angry Real Madrid fans following defeat by Barcelona</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The world's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club's Valdebebas training base after the 2-1 loss that saw Barcelona move four points clear of their rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As Bale pulled away, one angry fan struck the 86million signing's white Bentley with his hands and feet, while his Madrid team-mates Jese and Sergio Ramos were also targeted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bale was unlucky not to score at the Nou Camp in front of an estimated 400 million watchers on television as his first-half goal was ruled out for Cristiano Ronaldo being offside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Wales international, despite helping Madrid win the Copa del Rey and Champions League by scoring in both finals last season, has found life difficult in Spain this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bale scored both goals in a 2-0 win against Levante less than two weeks ago, and celebrated ending his 829-minute drought by covering his ears as if to block out the criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It came after the former Tottenham Hotspur winger was whistled at his own stadium last month and a fan poll that found 40 per cent of supporters wanted Bale to be dropped by manager Carlo Ancelotti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Bale has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Chelsea previously, with the majority of Madrid fans seemingly hoping he decides to return to the Barclays Premier League.</td></tr>
