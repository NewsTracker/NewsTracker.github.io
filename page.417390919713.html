<h3>Victims of FIFA's scandal: small clubs, youth, local leagues</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - The accused in the FIFA scandal are easy to spot: globe-trotting executives charged with diverting millions meant to build the game to their personal accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Those who feel victimized aren't as obvious: Youth players with hand-me-down equipment, semi-pro clubs that can't afford to travel and developmental leagues that can't pay referees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Players and coaches can only dream about millions reportedly syphoned off by top soccer officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The reason that these people were able to make so much money corruptly goes to the love that people have for the sport," Kelly Currie, the acting U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said as 14 top world soccer officials were indicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"And so it's taking that love and skimming off the marketing rights that allowed these people to enrich themselves and line their pockets."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Take Fabio Braz, a 36-year-old defender on Brazil's lower-division America Football Club, which is deep in debt and having trouble paying for basics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He doesn't see money trickling down powerful Brazilian Football Confederation, whose new $35 million headquarters is a monument to wealth and power and whose former president was arrested Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The indictment claimed Brazilian soccer officials took bribes for decades, selling off TV rights and marketing agreements while millions were delivered to them personally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They take away our money," Braz told The Associated Press after Friday practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are here daily working our butts off, earning our keep, defending our families, fighting for our survival."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Narinder K. Bhatia, the vice president of India's Delhi Soccer Association, said little money trickles down to the grassroots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's been very difficult to run the game," Bhatia said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We are unable to provide nutrition. A cup of tea and a snack is not enough for players during matches."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In South Africa, revelations that bribes were paid to get the 2010 World Cup have angered millions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The indictment said "youth leagues and development programs" were hit hardest by corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>FIFA spent $1 billion on development projects the last three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But it's unclear how much of that money got to players and clubs, or ended up in the bank accounts of FIFA officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Christopher Gaffney, who studies global sports events at the University of Zurich, said the victims stretch beyond field, pointing to businesses involved or hurt by the schemes: Employees making shoes in Asian sweatshops who went underpaid, while their companies paid millions in bribes; Nepalese workers who died building massive stadiums so tiny Qatar can host the 2022 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The victims are hidden by the spectacle," Gaffney said in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"White-collar crime has its greatest impacts on those who don't own a suit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A worker leaned a ladder on a wall at dawn Thursday and pulled down - letter by letter - a sign on the Brazilian Football Confederation building that read: "Sede Jose Maria Marin," Jose Maria Marin Building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Marin's was among those arrested in Switzerland and is charged with taking millions in bribes from multiple companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He stepped down in April to become a CBF vice president.</td></tr>
