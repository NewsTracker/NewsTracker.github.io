<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HONOLULU - A lake of lava on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has been rising over the past week and, at times, overflowing in a spectacular show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Janet Babb, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said Thursday that this is the first time lava from this vent has come into view from a public platform within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Hawaii's Big Island.</td></tr>
