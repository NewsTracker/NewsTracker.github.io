<h3>State Department: No record of Clinton signing 'separation' form</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>That document is known as a "separation" form, which officials are supposed to sign upon leaving the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It certifies that the person who signs it has turned over all "classified or administratively controlled" materials, as well as all "unclassified documents and papers" relating to official government business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Given that Clinton exclusively used personal email while secretary of state and didn't turn over official records until late last year, a former Justice Department official said last week that if Clinton signed that form, she probably gave a false statement and broke the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters they are "fairly certain she did not" sign it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We have reviewed Secretary Clinton's official personnel file and administrative files and do not have any record of her signing the OF109 [form]," Psaki said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This admission comes after the department for days was unable to answer questions about whether Clinton signed the form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It also raises questions about whether Clinton, by not signing it, at least violated department policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Psaki claimed Clinton did not violate any policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Further, she said Tuesday that neither of Clinton's two immediate predecessors, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, signed such a statement either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She also said that different bureaus within the department had different rules relating to such statements that had the effect of making their completion optional by some employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Shannen Coffin, a senior lawyer under the George W. Bush administration, first cited the form OF109 in questioning whether Clinton committed a violation by exclusively using personal email as secretary of state, and then not turning over those emails deemed work-related until after leaving the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If she indeed signed the document, he told Fox News last week, "there's no question [she broke the law]."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And if Clinton did not sign that document, he added, "why not?"</td></tr>

<h3>Knicks topple Spurs in OT</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Galloway had a game-high 22 points, Shved added a game-high seven assists and Andrea Bargnani posted 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who improved to 2-2 on the heels of six straight losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They led 101-99 late in overtime when Tim Duncan worked his way to the free throw line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He was pure with the first free throw, but missed the second one, and Amundson secured the board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Amundson then got fouled and split his pair with eight seconds to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Out of a timeout, Duncan looked for a cutting Kawhi Leonard, but his pass was knocked away and Amundson came up with the loose ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Shved made two free throws to put the game away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It feels great, more for the players than anything," said Knicks coach Derek Fisher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tony Parker paced the Spurs with 21 points, and Tiago Splitter had 12 with 13 rebounds in the disappointing setback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They moved the ball better than we did, they played better team basketball," said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We didn't respect the game, we didn't respect our opponent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>San Antonio scored the game's first six points and never trailed in the first half, though the Knicks did force six ties during the opening quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Spurs built a lead in the second, winning the stanza 23-17 to take a 52-42 edge into halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Galloway hit a 3 to jump-start New York's 15-5 run midway through the third quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He also scored on three straight possessions to cap the flurry that had the Knicks within three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Spurs took a timeout and regrouped, extending their lead back into double figures over the next four minutes, but another run early in the fourth allowed New York to tie the game at 77-77.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Knicks finally got over the hump with six minutes left, when Cole Aldrich's putback capped an 8-0 run to give them their first lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It was Aldrich's only basket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>There were six lead changes in the final 2:54 of regulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Marco Belinelli and Amundson traded buckets in the final 30 seconds before Leonard's jumper rimmed out at the horn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Duncan has played more minutes in his NBA career than the entire Knicks roster put together ... The Spurs had won seven of eight ... Both teams shot 3-for-14 from 3-point range.</td></tr>
