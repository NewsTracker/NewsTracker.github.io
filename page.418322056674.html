<tr><td>13</td><td>Greece's defense minister says three opposition parties have signed a declaration backing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in bailout negotiations with creditors.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>Sigmar Gabriel, who is also Germany's economy minister, said there is a danger that Greece will suffer a shortage of essential goods such as medicine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The people there need help, and we shouldn't deny it to them just because we're not satisfied with the outcome of the referendum," Gabriel told reporters in Berlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He echoed earlier statements from across Europe that it's up to the Greek government to make a new bailout proposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Greece's economy minister says the European Central Bank should keep Greek banks alive so talks can push ahead with creditors.</td></tr>

<tr><td>36</td><td>The two leaders discussed the results of Sunday's referendum in Greece and "several questions about the further development of Russian-Greek cooperation," the Kremlin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>During Monday's call, the Kremlin said Putin "expressed support for the Greek people in overcoming the difficulties facing their country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The head of VTB, Russia's second-largest state bank, said over the weekend that Russia might be interested in buying Greek assets if they were to be privatized but that direct loans to Greece were unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The eurozone's top official says he wants Greece to stay in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is also the Dutch finance minister, also says the Greeks want the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"That is their goal, and still mine," he said on his way into a Dutch Cabinet meeting Monday in The Hague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"But we will have to see if it happens."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Asked if it was still worth talking with the Greeks after the referendum, Dijsselbloem said: "We will see. We are going to see in the coming days if there are still openings. But there are no easy solutions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Dijsselbloem added tough measures are still necessary in Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"And if the government and population reject tough measures then we get to a very difficult place," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The Greek referendum result is giving heart to anti-austerity parties in other countries.</td></tr>

<tr><td>48</td><td>Socialist leader Antonio Costa said austerity policies are "wrong" and endanger European unity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>A new focus on growth is needed to rid the eurozone of the deep economic differences between its 19 members, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Like Greece, Portugal got a bailout, when it asked for 78 billion ($86 billion) in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Spending cuts and tax hikes have reduced its budget deficit but have increased unemployment and reduced living standards.</td></tr>

<tr><td>56</td><td>He noted that the market reactions "have been quite limited outside the situation on Greece."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The German Finance Ministry says a reduction in Greece's debt mountain isn't on Germany's agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said "our position is well-known ... a debt cut is not an issue for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>He said there were no grounds for a debt restructuring given that Greece has yet to set out fresh proposals for financial aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Last week, the International Monetary Fund, which has been a major creditor of Greece over the past five years, suggested that debt relief for Greece is necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Jaeger says Europe decided that economic reforms coupled with aid was a better route to a sustainable future for Greece, adding that it was working well in the country, until the end of last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>German officials are insisting that Greece can only hope to receive aid from the eurozone's rescue fund if it accepts conditions in return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said Monday the rules underpinning the fund, the European Stability Mechanism, clearly specify that all aid is subject to conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>He said that "it is simply not legally possible to back away from this principle."</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, echoed that sentiment: "We are stressing the principle that solidarity is inseparable from (a country's) own efforts, and we see that this principle has brought significant success in the past few years."</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Seibert says Germany will see what proposals Greece makes to its European partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said his government is ready to talk about a third Greek bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>De Guindos told reporters in Madrid after the government's economic team met to discuss Greece's referendum result that everyone wants Greece to "stay in the euro."</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>However, he said "the rules for the euro remain the same as they were two days ago."</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>"I don't contemplate in any way Greece leaving the euro," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>The minister conceded the situation now was probably the most complex since the euro launched in 1999 but that the currency's irreversibility would be reaffirmed Tuesday at the meeting of eurozone finance ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman says Germany sees no basis at present for entering negotiations on a new bailout program for Greece, but that the door remains open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Steffen Seibert said Monday that Germany respects the "clear 'no' vote" by Greeks against austerity measures demanded by creditors and that "the door for talks always remains open."</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>However, he said the conditions are "not there at present to enter negotiations on a new program."</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>He said the "no" vote is a vote against the principle - still supported by Germany - that solidarity requires countries to take responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Seibert says Europe will explore what possibilities there are to help Greek citizens and "a lot will depend on what proposals the Greek government now puts on the table."</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said discussions over Greece's debt sustainability are not "taboo" and that the country could not recover given its current repayment obligations "in the months and years to come."</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>He also called for the European Central Bank to maintain liquidity assistance to Greek banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>French and German leaders are meeting late Monday for a "deep conversation" leading to a solution, Sapin told Europe 1 radio.</td></tr>

<tr><td>83</td><td>Rania Antonopoulos told the BBC there is still time to get a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>With Greece's future hanging in the balance, the country is running out of cash and is at risk of a financial crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>"There are still 48 hours, there is still this week," said Antonopoulos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>"We will push as much as possible for an outcome, a result of these negotiations that does not obligate Greece to go in that direction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Cyprus says it has been the only bailed-out country in the 19-country eurozone to support Greece's demand for restructuring its massive debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Government spokesman Nicos Christodoulides has told state radio that Cyprus' president and finance minister backed a restructuring of Greek debt and negotiations between Greece and its creditors need to begin immediately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>Cypriot Finance Minister Harris Georgiades said last week that the country could consider writing off 330 million euros ($370 million) in rescue loans to Greece if other eurozone countries agreed on a deal to lighten the country's debt load.</td></tr>

<tr><td>94</td><td>Stubb says the near future will be very difficult for Greece and mending the economy will require extensive reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>He added that "negotiations can only be resumed when the Greek government is willing to cooperate and commit itself to measures to stabilize the country's public economy and implement the structural reforms required for debt sustainability."</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>European stock markets trimmed earlier losses after Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said he was quitting his post despite the overwhelming 'no' vote in the country's referendum on creditor proposals on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>After opening sharply lower, European stock markets recovered some ground on the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>The Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares was down 1.6 percent while Germany's DAX fell 1.2 percent.</td></tr>
