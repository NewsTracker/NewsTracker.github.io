<h3>Wisconsin defeats Oregon 72-65, heads back to Sweet 16 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Wisconsin wasn't at its best against Oregon.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>The Badgers beat the Ducks for the second straight year in the NCAA Tournament's round of 32, this time 72-65 at CenturyLink Center on Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Wisconsin had its worst shooting game in a month and got outrebounded by the smaller Ducks, and Big Ten player of the year Frank Kaminsky was quiet offensively for long stretches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Still, the Badgers (33-3) were able to get out to a quick lead and hold on, and now they're headed to the regional semifinals for the fourth time in five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The West's No.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>''We're definitely excited and thrilled to be there, but we're not as in awe or shocked as we were last year,'' Nigel Hayes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''Last year, we were jumping around up and down on the court, celebrating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This time, it was 'Hoo-rah, good job guys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sam Dekker scored 17 points, hitting a couple big baskets after Oregon (26-10) had tied it late.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kaminsky had 16 points, with no shot bigger than his putback of Hayes' missed free throw to make it a 10-point game with 44 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hayes had 14 points and Bronson Koenig added 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Pac-12 player of the year Joseph Young, who scored 27 points in a win over Oklahoma State on Friday, had 30 against the Badgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''We had ourselves in a position against an experienced, well-coached and very good team,'' Ducks coach Dana Altman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Wisconsin played with the lead all game until Dwayne Benjamin tied it at 52 with a high-arcing 3-pointer from in front of his bench with 5:27 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Badgers took the lead right back, though, with Dekker's reverse layup and 3-pointer to make it 58-52.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''Oregon made their run to fight back,'' Dekker said, ''just as a good team always does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And good teams respond to those runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>We settled in, and guys weren't going to get too riled up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>We got a big 6-0 run there and opened up the lead and held on from there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Jalil Abdulu-Bassit had 12 points for the Ducks, who were trying to get to the Sweet 16 for the second time in three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The size advantage that Wisconsin was supposed to enjoy against Oregon wasn't much of an advantage at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Oregon outrebounded the Badgers 34-32, outscored them 30-24 in the lane and had four blocks to Wisconsin's three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''At this point,'' guard Josh Gasser said, ''I don't care if we play like crap and still win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Credit Oregon for causing Wisconsin to shoot just 43 percent from the field and go 7 for 23 on 3-pointers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''I knew they were going to throw a lot of different things at us - double teams, triple teams, pressure up and down the court,'' Kaminsky said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Oregon, which shot 55 percent against Oklahoma State on Friday, shot 44.1 percent and needed some time to get its offense going.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Young had a couple shots rim out and missed his first five, and Elijah Cook couldn't finish what should have been an easy dunk off a Young lob.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Once Young started connecting, the Ducks were right back in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Oregon: Joseph Young tied Terrell Brandon for most points in a season by an Oregon player, with 745... Jordan Bell finished the season with a school-record 94 blocks.</td></tr>
