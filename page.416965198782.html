<h3>Facebook enters the minimum wage fight</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Workplace benefits at Silicon Valley's biggest names including Google (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) are the stuff of legend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now tech powerhouse Facebook (FB) is entering the minimum wage fight, implementing new standards on benefits for its contractors and vendors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Vendors or contractors in the U.S.who do a "substantial amount of work" with the social media company will be required to pay their workers at least $15 an hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Other requirements include offering at least 15 paid days off for vacation, sick pay and holidays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Additionally, individuals who do not currently receive parental leave will be offered $4,000 in "new child" benefits, according to a blog posted on Facebook by COO Sheryl Sandberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are committed to providing a safe, fair work environment to everyone who helps Facebook connect the world," Sandberg wrote in the post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is an important step forward in this work for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While other tech companies have boosted benefits for some security guards and shuttle drivers, Facebook is among the first tech giants to publicly take a stance on the minimum wage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The federal minimum wage stands at $7.25 an hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Facebook joins other large corporations that already have raised wages, including Wal-Mart (WMT), Gap (GPS), McDonald's (MCD) and T.J. Maxx (TJX).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The minimum wage debate is intensifying heading into the 2016 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And now Silicon Valley is weighing in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The question now is whether other tech leaders will follow suit and raise wages and benefits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"All of this helps to move the argument forward-the writing is on the wall," said Holly Sklar, president of advocacy group Business for a Fair Minimum Wage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Too many Silicon Valley companies have employees with great pay and benefits and perks, but historically use contractors with little or no benefits."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Facebook's new benefits took effect May 1 for its largest vendors and support teams at the company's Menlo Park, California, headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A Facebook representative declined to comment on what will happen to vendors who don't comply with the new rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>However, the representative did say the company worked with its vendors on the benefit changes so the new rules were not sprung on them.</td></tr>
