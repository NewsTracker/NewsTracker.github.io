<h3>U.N. refugee chief to visit Kenya to plan return of Somali refugees</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The head of the U.N. refugee agency will visit Kenya in early May to discuss plans to repatriate more than 335,800 Somali refugees following a massacre by Somali Islamists at a Kenyan university.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kenya has given the United Nations three months to close Dadaab refugee camp, one of the largest in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kenya has said in the past that al Shabaab militants use the camp as a hideout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is about an hour's drive from Garissa, where militants attacked the university on April 2, killing 148 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The idea is to have a pledging conference so we will be discussing that when the high commissioner comes," said Raouf Mazou, the U.N. refugee agency's (UNHCR) representative in Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He could not say how much money they would need to fund the mass repatriation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>UNHCR chief Antonio Guterres has visited Dadaab several times, including at the height of the 2011 Somali famine when the camp's population swelled to half a million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Since then, 50,000 refugees have returned spontaneously, Kenya's foreign minister, Amina Mohamed, told a news conference on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Another 2,000 have been voluntarily repatriated under a pilot scheme launched by UNHCR, Kenya and Somalia in December, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are very encouraged because none of them has come back," said Mohamed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"That's already a positive signal for the refugees that are in the camps to do as the others have done -- which is basically to move back to Somalia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The speed at which Dadaab is closed will depend on funding, Mohamed said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If we can move those refugees within the three months, we will do it," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We will be requesting our partners, donors, for resources, that we will use to expedite the repatriation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>UNHCR has urged Kenya to rethink its plan, warning that it is illegal under the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention to force refugees back to areas where their lives are threatened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Aid agencies have also been critical, as conflict and hunger persist across the Horn of Africa nation which has been mired in civil war since 1991.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A UNHCR survey of refugees in Dadaab found less than 3 percent intended to return to Somalia within the next two years, the U.N. says in its latest east African bulletin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The remaining 97 percent said they were not ready, due to insecurity, lack of employment, housing and basic services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mazou said the refugees in Dadaab would like to return home if they could be sure of access to basic services and security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"So this is what is being worked on," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>UNHCR, Kenya and Somalia will ensure that returning refugees have access to healthcare, education and jobs, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mazou was speaking on the steps of Kenya's foreign ministry following a meeting with Mohamed and Somalia's foreign affairs minister, Abdusalam Omer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We are ready to receive our people," said Omer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"It will be done humanely, orderly, and quickly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Kenya hosts the second largest number of refugees in Africa after Ethiopia.</td></tr>
