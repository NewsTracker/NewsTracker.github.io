<h3>Working under the weather: Boston low-wage laborers beaten down by winter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Problems with public transit caused the 25-year-old mother of two to lose hours at her job at Dunkin' Donuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Added to the extra child care she had to pay because schools were closed, that has put a real strain on her budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's very expensive. I can't wait for it to go," Fisher said of the snow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's terrible, because you be trying to do your best, and there's something that's always going to stop [you]."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A lot of low-wage workers across Massachusetts can understand that feeling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As Boston has faced its second-snowiest winter on record - over 105 inches so far, according to the National Weather Service - many have had to miss shifts, scramble for child care or deal with leaks and power outages caused by snow piling up on aging roofs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While the weather has made things especially difficult this winter, experts say it is only aggravating long-existing problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"One thing that's been very clear is the obvious hardships on low-wage workers by the failures of the T [the public transportation rail system] and public services in the storms. But I don't think what's very clear is the magnitude of that, because I don't think a lot of people are aware that 40 percent of the working population makes under $15 an hour," said Susan Moir, who directs the Labor Resource Center at University of Massachusetts at Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"So a substantial number of people were affected by this. Deeply affected."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency is still calculating the cost of this winter's storms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But Gov. Charlie Baker said that cleanup from the blizzard at the end of January alone could have cost the commonwealth about $30 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And a 2014 study by IHS Global Insight put the total cost of a one-day snowstorm in Massachusetts at $265 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Of that, $194 million comes from lost wages and salaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The biggest problems this year have been with the T, which is run by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Record snow and cold brought the system to its knees earlier this winter, and parts have still yet to fully recover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>For many low-wage workers, that has meant losing pay, sleep or both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The days that I had to go into work, I was just late because it was a lot of snow. And it was traffic. The buses kept getting stuck, and it was running on a delay, a two-hour delay. And no one knew anything," said Fisher, who said the delays made her miss a shift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Severe delays and full shutdowns in the face of winter storms have been politically toxic, prompting MBTA General Manager Beverly Scott to announce her resignation on Feb. 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Baker has put together a commission to recommend solutions while calling for $14 million in cuts to the MBTA to help plug the state's large budget deficit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Experts disagree on whether those cuts will affect T service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But there is agreement that the system desperately needs to upgrade its equipment and infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Over a long period of time, the state has chronically underfunded our public transportation system so that trains get older and older and systems break down when we have bad weather," said Noah Berger, the executive director of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>According to him, service interruptions on the T, along with business and school closings, hit low-wage workers especially hard because they rely on public transit to get to work, school and child care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Jonathan Cornier works as an airport baggage handler, and he lost a full day's pay when the airport shut down because of the snow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Under federal law, employersdo not have to pay workers who are eligible for overtime pay - nonexempt employees - if their business closes because of inclement weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Unlike many white-collar and professional jobs, low-wage, hourly employees are almost all nonexempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I definitely had to cut back," said Cornier, 23, whose income helps support his mother and sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I always have to cut back when I miss hours - food, transportation. I have to legit go to work and home. I can't go nowhere else."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Then there's the problem of snow piling up on roofs - something Dora Sandoval, 38, a house cleaner, knows about firsthand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>She and her two children have been in the dark since Feb. 22, when firefighters cut off power to her Roxbury apartment because of a leak caused by snow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Since then, she said, she has had to cook in her neighbor's apartment, and her 13-year-old daughter is unable to study at night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I have a big problem, because I wake up early in the morning and everything is dark," Sandoval said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I have only one lamp, and everybody sleeps in the same room because my son [is] scared about the house because it's too dark. This is why I am worried, especially for the electricity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>According to Moir, the cost of repairing leaky roofs and frozen pipes could have a major long-term impact on Massachusetts renters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"If landlords are paying huge [insurance] deductibles for the damage to their property, they're going to pass those costs on to the tenants," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"The tenants will continue to pay the damages on this ... Tenants will pay for a lot of the damages that were done to the housing stock in Boston as a result of this storm."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>With short days, frigid temperatures and mountains of snow that have made just moving around the city nearly impossible at times, it's fair to say that most of Boston is a little on edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>And many believe low-wage workers have been hit the hardest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Still, while she's clearly frustrated that her power has been cut off for days because of the snow, Sandoval remains unflappable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"This year is very heavy snow," she said, "but I try to continue my life."</td></tr>

<h3>Islamic State militants bulldoze ancient Assyrian city Nimrud</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baghdad: Islamic State fighters have looted and bulldozed the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, the Iraqi government says, in their latest assault on some of the world's greatest archaeological and cultural treasures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A tribal source from the nearby city of Mosul said the ultra-radical Sunni Islamists, who dismiss Iraq's pre-Islamic heritage as idolatrous, had pillaged the 3000-year-old site on the banks of the Tigris river.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Islamic State members came to the Nimrud archaeological city and looted the valuables in it and then they proceeded to level the site to the ground," the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The assault against Nimrud came just a week after the release of a video showing Islamic State forces smashing museum statues and carvings in Mosul, the city they seized along with much of northern Iraq last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Daesh terrorist gangs continue to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity," Iraq's tourism and antiquities ministry said, referring to Islamic State by its Arabic acronym.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"In a new crime in their series of reckless offences they assaulted the ancient city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy machinery, appropriating the archaeological attractions dating back 13 centuries BC," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nimrud, about 30 kilometres south of Mosul, was built around 1250 BC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Four centuries later it became capital of the neo-Assyrian empire - at the time the most powerful state on earth, extending to modern-day Egypt, Turkey and Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Many of its most famous surviving monuments were removed years ago by archaeologists, including colossal Winged Bulls which are now in London's British Museum and hundreds of precious stones and pieces of gold which were moved to Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But ruins of the ancient city remain at the northern Iraqi site, which has been excavated by a series of experts since the 19th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>British archaeologist Max Mallowan and his wife, crime writer Agatha Christie, worked at Nimrud in the 1950s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Archaeologists have compared the assault on Iraq's cultural history to the Taliban's destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the damage wreaked by Islamic State, not just on ancient monuments but also on rival Muslim places of worship, has been swift, relentless and more wide-ranging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Last week's video showed them toppling statues and carvings from plinths in the Mosul museum and smashing them with sledgehammers and drills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It also showed damage to a huge statue of a bull at the Nergal Gate into the city of Nineveh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Archaeologists said it was hard to quantify the damage, because some items appeared to be replicas, but many priceless articles had been destroyed including artefacts from Hatra, a stunning pillared city in northern Iraq dating back 2000 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Islamic State, which rules a self-declared caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria, promotes a fiercely purist interpretation of Sunni Islam which seeks its inspiration from early Islamic history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It rejects religious shrines of any sort and condemns Iraq's majority Shi'ite Muslims as heretics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In July it destroyed the tomb of the prophet Jonah in Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It has also attacked Shi'ite places of worship and last year gave Mosul's Christians an ultimatum to convert to Islam, pay a religious levy or face death by the sword.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It has also targeted the Yazidi minority in the Sinjar mountains west of Mosul.</td></tr>
