<h3>Netanyahu wins Israel election after sharp shift to the right</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>And it seems to have worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been reelected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won a come-from-behind victory in Israel's election on Wednesday after tacking hard to the right in the final days of campaigning, including abandoning a commitment to negotiate a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a four-day pre-election blitz, Netanyahu made a series of promises designed to shore up his Likud base and draw voters from other right-wing and nationalist parties, including a pledge to go on building settlements on occupied land and saying that there would be no Palestinian state if he is re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>With 99.5 percent of votes counted, Likud had won 30 seats in the 120-member Knesset, comfortably defeating the Zionist Union opposition on 24 seats, Israeli media said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It amounted to a dramatic and unexpected victory - the last opinion polls published four days before the vote showed the Zionist Union with a four-seat advantage over Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a statement, Likud said Netanyahu intended to form a new government within weeks, with negotiations already underway with the pro-settler Jewish Home party led by Naftali Bennett, as well as with religious groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The critical party to get on side will be centrist Kulanu, led by former Likud member Moshe Kahlon, who won 10 seats, making him a kingmaker given his ability to side with either Netanyahu or the center-left opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Reality is not waiting for us," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The citizens of Israel expect us to quickly put together a leadership that will work for them regarding security, economy and society as we committed to do - and we will do so."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If he manages to pull together a workable coalition, it would give Netanyahu a fourth-term in office, putting him on track to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister, a label held by the country's founding father, David Ben-Gurion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While Likud is the largest party, the process of forming a coalition is likely to be difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It needs 61 seats in the Knesset and crossing that threshold will be challenging given the amount of division across Israel's political landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Netanyahu's victory is also likely to prolong the country's testy relationship with US President Barack Obama, especially after his strident words on settlements and his backing away from the long-stated international goal of arriving at a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Despite the numbers stacking up in Netanyahu's favor, Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog said "everything is still open" and that he already had spoken to party leaders about the possibility of forming a government, although the arithmetic for him is much harder to achieve than for Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>During much of the campaign, Netanyahu had focused on security issues and the threat from Iran's nuclear program, a message that appeared to gain little traction with voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Zionist Union's focus on socio-economic issues, including the lack of housing and the high cost of living in Israel, appeared to be generating much more momentum, at least as far as opinion polls went.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Netanyahu's tack to the right, playing up fears of the spread of Islamist groups, promising no concessions to the Palestinians and raising alarm about growing support for Arab-Israeli parties looks to have spurred his base into action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>From the Palestinian point-of-view, the results are a deep concern, raising the prospect of more settlement expansion on land they want for their own state in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as in Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>If Netanyahu follows through on his pledges it would put him on a collision course with the Obama administration and the European Union, which has been weighing steps including trade measures to sanction Israel for its settlements policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Palestinians will formally become members of the International Criminal Court from April 1 and have said they will pursue war crimes charges against Israel over its 48-year occupation of the West Bank and last year's Gaza war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Pre-empting those steps, Israel has suspended the transfer of tax revenue it collects on the Palestinians' behalf, holding back around $120 million a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That has crippled the Palestinian budget and led to deep pay cuts for state workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator in peace talks with Israel that collapsed in April, told Reuters it appeared Netanyahu would form the next government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Citing the Israeli leader's rejection of a Palestinian state, Erekat said: "Mr. Netanyahu has done nothing in his political life but to destroy the two-state solution."</td></tr>

<h3>Many Blackstone M&A bankers expected to depart ahead of spin off to Taubman</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Some of the bankers have decided to move elsewhere or retire, while others have lost out to people doing similar jobs at Taubman's PJT Capital LP, the sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blackstone agreed last October to spin off its advisory operations in the second half of this year into a new publicly traded company that will be run by Taubman, 54.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The operations of the business being spun off include M&A, restructuring and private fund advisory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>PJT currently focuses on M&A advisory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The likely exodus of senior M&A bankers shows that, even though Blackstone shareholders, including its co-founder Stephen Schwarzman, are expected to own 65 percent of the combined business, Taubman has the biggest role in shaping it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He will be CEO of the combined firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Since he left a senior role at Morgan Stanley in 2012 to strike out on his own, Taubman has advised on deals with a value of almost $240 billion, and he ranked 12th in the global M&A advisory league tables in 2013 and 23rd in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By contrast, Blackstone ranked 50th in 2013 and 68th last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Former Blackstone executives are expected to have a bigger presence in the restructuring and fund advisory areas, with the vast majority of the 22 Blackstone partners in those operations expected to stay, including the heads of these businesses, the sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On the M&A side, though, 12 of the 17 senior managing directors at Blackstone, including investment banking veterans such as Mary Anne Citrino, Anthony Steains, James Schaefer and Greg Hewett, currently do not yet have agreements to join PJT, the sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Spokesmen for Blackstone and PJT declined to comment on behalf of the firms and the people involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Talks are ongoing and PJT expects as many as nine Blackstone senior MDs to join its M&A business by the time of the spinoff, the sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Among those who already have agreed to work at PJT are Blackstone senior managing directors Ivan Brockman and Karl Knapp, the sources added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some of the Blackstone bankers are not joining PJT because they do not want to make the multi-year commitment to back what is, in many ways, a new venture, the sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>New advisory firms can take several years to ramp up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There are also departures related to PJT's plans to close some of Blackstone's 15 advisory offices around the world, the sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Frankfurt office, for example, will close because PJT's clients can be better served for now by more well staffed offices, such as London, the sources added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>To be sure, most of the 15 Blackstone M&A bankers who are the next tier down - at managing director level - are expected to join PJT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Most of them are younger and keen to be part of a new venture, according to the sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>John Studzinski, who runs the Blackstone M&A advisory business, will not move over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He will stay with Blackstone to work on fundraising initiatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Martin Alderson Smith, another M&A senior managing director, is also staying with Blackstone to advise the firm on its investments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>PJT has poached several high-profile bankers from major Wall Street rivals in recent months, including, most recently, Jessica Kearns, head of JPMorgan Chase & Co's technology, media and telecommunications syndicated and leveraged finance group, according to some of the sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Other high-profile hires by Taubman in recent months include Johannes Groeller, co-head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa M&A at Morgan Stanley, as well as Don Cornwell, a top sports banker from Morgan Stanley, and John Trousdale, vice chairman of global mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse Group AG.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In January, Blackstone said it had extended the vesting period for shares given to employees, a move partly aimed at making it more difficult for bankers to be poached from PJT by competitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>PJT's revenue is a small fraction of the revenue at New York-based Blackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>PJT had pro-forma revenue of $401.1 million in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Blackstone, with its giant private equity, real estate, credit and hedge fund arms, by contrast, had revenue of $7.5 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Yet the spin off is a bet that Blackstone's advisory business is worth more on its own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Once it is spun off, it will be able to pursue private equity firms as clients free from conflict of interest concerns over Blackstone's ownership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Companies may be more inclined to hire the new firm if they aren't worried that Blackstone could be a buyer of their assets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Shares in other publicly traded investment banking boutiques, Evercore Partners Inc, Moelis & Co, Greenhill & Co Inc and Lazard Ltd, currently trade at an average 50 percent premium to Blackstone based on projected 2016 earnings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Blackstone's hope is that an independent, conflict-free PJT will be valued close to those levels, or even better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"We continue to estimate the tax-free spin would improve the value that the public markets were attributing to Blackstone's advisory business," Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note last week.</td></tr>
