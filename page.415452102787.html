<h3>Kurds battle Islamic State in Syria, U.S.-led coalition jets strike</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Kurdish YPG militia, which has emerged as the coalition's main partner fighting Islamic State on the ground in Syria, has made significant gains in recent weeks in the north, cutting an important supply route from Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Last week Islamic State appeared to try to seize back the initiative, attacking Kurdish fighters using tanks and heavy weapons close to the Turkish border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Air strikes hit areas close to the town of Tal Tamer, south of the Turkish border, overnight on Friday and on Saturday, said Redur Xelil, spokesman for the YPG.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There is fighting which continues around Tel Tamer but the coalition warplanes have targeted the area, the last strikes were a short while ago," he said by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The overnight strikes were the first on the area since last month, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There were reports of casualties on both sides on Saturday, the Observatory said, without giving precise figures.</td></tr>

<h3>Chicago aims to be world's greenest city on St. Patrick's weekend</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chicago is going for the title of "greenest city in the world" this weekend for the second year in a row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We will have the most buildings lit up in green of any other city in the world," said Blair Ciecko, director of ShamROCK Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I don't think we should have a problem nabbing the title of greenest city."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chicago's St. Patrick's Day celebrations will also include countless pub crawls, at least three parades and one very green river.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some of the city's most prominent buildings and monuments will be illuminated in green Friday through Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>ShamROCK Chicago, the group that organized the lighting, has 15 structures lined up to participate, including Trump Tower, Navy Pier, John Hancock Center, Art Institute of Chicago, Soldier Field and Old St. Patrick's Church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tourism Ireland created the "greenest city" campaign to get cities to light up landmarks around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>People can participate by taking selfies and posting them on social media with the hashtag #ShamROCKChicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nineteen stations are sprinkled throughout the city and photos will be projected on the Block Thirty Seven building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This project gives Chicagoans the opportunity to display their green pride," Ciecko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"People feed off each other's energy. Even people who aren't Irish get into it. I really think St. Patrick's Day gives people an opportunity to come together to celebrate something common to this city's culture."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even politicians are putting differences aside for the celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The South Side Irish Parade will include Mayor Rahm Emanuel, challenger Jesus "Chuy" Garcia and Gov. Bruce Rauner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They will march down Western Avenue from 103rd Street in Beverly to 115th Street in Morgan Park on Sunday, said Tom McGourty, chairman of the South Side parade committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We do love having them here," McGourty said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's great that they're coming. But it's also not the point of the day. It's about our neighborhood and our Irish heritage. Our focus is on the families and the community."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The change came after the parade was shut down in 2010 and 2011 after public intoxication and assaults marred the 2009 event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>More than 315,000 people had been turning out for the march, McGourty said, and it was unsustainable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It all started with two guys and their kids marching around the block for a little local parade," McGourty said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We wanted to get the focus back to that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"After the parade, we can have our house parties, eat corn beef and drink more Guinness than we should," McGourty said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"There are so many kids involved, and we just didn't want to see people drinking around them. Again, it's about the families and embracing our heritage."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mary Mallee, manager of Fox's, a pub on Western Avenue, said the community prefers the new alcohol policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We are trying to gear things toward families," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It gives them a better sense of community. This is a very family oriented neighborhood. Many people are of Irish descent and have been here for generations. It's a unique celebration in Chicago."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Billed as the "largest St. Patrick's Day party in Chicago," the celebration includes a silent auction, bagpipers, Irish dancers, a fiddle-off and appearances by the St. Patrick's Day and South Side Irish Parade queens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The party is at Park West, 322 W.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Armitage Ave., and tickets are $55 to $75.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ages 21 and up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>More than 45 pounds of emerald green vegetable dye will be dumped in the Chicago River between Columbus and Lake Shore drives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Thousands are expected to attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Hurry - the color only lasts about five hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The dyeing will be followed by a parade on Columbus Drive and north through Grant Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The parade - which starts at noon and is in its 60th year - will last about three hours and include flags, floats and bagpipes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. cruises are 90-minute tours that explore all three branches of the Chicago River.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Lunch includes corned beef, cabbage, bread pudding and Irish beer or Irish coffee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Cost is $49 per person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The 3 p.m. tour is 2 1/2 hours and includes a buffet, green beer and dancing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Cost is $49.90 for adults and $29.95 for children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The Irish American Heritage Center festival includes Irish music and dancing at 4626 N.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Knox Ave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Tickets are $12 to $15 for adults and free for children 12 and under.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The one-mile race starts at 112th Street and Western Avenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The route goes north along the parade route and finishes at 104th Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The Beverly neighborhood parade starts at 103rd Street and proceeds down Western Avenue to 115th Street.</td></tr>

<tr><td>54</td><td>The ribbon-cutting is at 10 a.m. Tuesday.</td></tr>
