<h3>Putin says Nemtsov assassination a 'disgrace'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Russian president Vladimir Putin says the killing of Boris Nemtsov has brought disgrace on Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Russian president Vladimir Putin has described the killing of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov as a tragedy that has brought disgrace on Russia, and warned against a rise in "extremist crime".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We must pay the greatest attention to crimes that prompt a major reaction, including those that are politically charged," he told interior ministry officials at a televised meeting on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We must rid Russia of disgrace and tragedies like the one we just saw... the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Nemtsov, a longtime Putin critic and anti-corruption crusader, was gunned down near the Kremlin on Friday night in an attack that sent shockwaves through the Russian opposition and the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Putin has previously described Mr Nemtsov's murder as a "provocation" and vowed that everything would be done to bring to justice those who committed a "vile and cynical murder".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Investigators have said they are examining possible motives for the murder, including Mr Nemtsov's opposition to Russian military actions in Ukraine and a link to his condemnation of the attack against the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly in Paris in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Putin also warned against a rise in "extremist crime", without directly linking it to Mr Nemtsov's murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Extremists poison society with militant nationalism, intolerance and aggression," he said, adding that unrest in Ukraine was a consequence of such extremism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's important to react instantly to any signs of extremist action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Kremlin has denied any involvement, saying that the killing was a "provocation" designed to discredit Mr Putin and strengthen his opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But Mr Nemtsov's friends say the Kremlin is to blame for fomenting an atmosphere of hatred towards its opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Who was Boris Nemtsov?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Look back at the career of Boris Nemtsov who served as a deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin before becoming one of the most prominent opponents of Russian president Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Earlier on Wednesday, the director of Russia's federal security service said that an investigation had identified several suspects, without giving details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Russian news agencies reported that investigators were seeking a car in connection to the killing that may be connected to the finance ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters that the car, a Ford, did not belong to the ministry itself but was owned by a state enterprise responsible for providing security to government institutions, including the finance ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The vehicle drove past the spot where Mr Nemtsov was shot after the killing and when police patrol cars had already arrived at the scene, the statement said.</td></tr>
