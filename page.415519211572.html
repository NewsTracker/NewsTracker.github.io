<h3>Nepal boosts doctors, rescue efforts at Everest base camp</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Four doctors, up from two or three in the past, will be stationed at the base camp's emergency room tent, which will be equipped to handle almost any medical need, said Devi Bahadur Koirala of the Himalayan Rescue Association Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Authorities have also arranged for rescue helicopters to airlift sick or injured climbers from base camp within 90 minutes, Koirala said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Previously, each team would arrange their own rescue, which would often take hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sick or injured climbers would be first treated at the base camp and airlifted to their lower attitude clinic at Pheriche, located at an elevation of 4,370 meters (14,340 feet) and if necessary to the capital, Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During the spring climbing season that runs from March 1 to May 31, more than 300 foreign climbers attempting to scale Everest and their local guides and support staff swell the base camp's population to more than 1,000 people, turning the area into a tent village.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In addition, hundreds of trekkers hike up to the base camp during the same time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Koirala said most of their patients suffer from high altitude sickness, but other common problems include injuries and broken bones of people who slip and fall on the mountain slopes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the 2014 avalanche that struck just above the base camp, several local guides and porters who were carrying equipment and supplies at the beginning of the season were swept away by snow, hit by falling ice and rocks, or fell into crevasses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nepal was criticized for not having a rescue plan during disasters or any government presence at the base camp despite charging climbers huge permit fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nepal's government is also setting up a full-time office tent at the base camp this season which will have officials throughout the climbing season to provide security, settle disputes among climbers and monitor the activities of the hundreds of climbers and guides at the base camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They would provide information on climbing conditions and weather on the mountain and have communication equipment to quickly respond to any problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More than 4,000 climbers have scaled 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) Mount Everest since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hundreds of others have died in the attempt.</td></tr>

<h3>Apple in talks to launch online TV service: WSJ</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The service would have about 25 channels, anchored by broadcasters such as ABC, CBS and Fox, and be available across all devices powered by Apple's iOS operating system, including iPhones, iPads and Apple TV set-top boxes, the newspaper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple has been talking to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CBS Corp (CBS.N), and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) and other media companies to offer a "skinny" bundle with well-known channels like CBS, ESPN and FX, leaving out the many smaller networks in the standard cable TV package, the Journal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple, which is aiming to price the new service at about $30 to $40 a month, plans to announce the service in June and launch it in September, the newspaper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said the company does not comment on rumor and speculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fox and CBS declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Several media companies are considering joining streaming-only services, or launching their own like HBO and CBS, to attract young people who do not subscribe to traditional pay TV packages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But programmers also fear the packages could become so popular that they undercut current, more profitable deals with cable companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In January, Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) unveiled its long-anticipated video streaming service, named Sling TV, targeted at younger consumers who shun pricey cable and satellite subscriptions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dish's $20 a month service, the first from a distributor, will be available through Internet-connected devices such as Amazon Fire TV, Roku and Google Nexus Player for TVs, tablets, computers and smartphones and will include TV programming from ABC, ESPN and Maker Studios, Time Warner's (TWX.N) TNT, CNN, TBS, Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, and Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Others like Sony (6758.T) are also rolling out competing services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple is not in talks with NBCUniversal, owner of the NBC broadcast network and cable channels like USA and Bravo, because of a falling-out between Apple and NBCUniversal parent company Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), the Journal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple and Comcast were in early-stage discussions last year to offer a streaming-television service that would allow Apple set-top boxes to bypass congestion on the web.</td></tr>
