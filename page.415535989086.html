<h3>Ferguson police shooting suspect returns to court</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Williams, 20, is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action in connection with the shooting of two police officers who were keeping watch over a demonstration outside the Ferguson Police Department on March 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Protester Maldon Moffitt points his fingers and yells back at a pro-police demonstrator outside the Ferguson Police Department Sunday, March 15, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>About 100 pro-police demonstrators stand hold signs outside the Ferguson Police Department as the shadows of counter demonstrators are seen on the street Sunday, March 15, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>CLAYTON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>(AP) - A man accused of shooting two police officers in Ferguson returned to court Tuesday over a claim that St. Louis County police used excessive force during his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A circuit court judge agreed to defense lawyer Jerryl Christmas' request to photograph Jeffrey L. Williams in the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Online court records indicate prosecutors took their own photos at the brief hearing, which came one day after Williams, 20, made his first appearance in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Christmas told The Associated Press on Monday that police roughed up his client and described bruises on Williams' back, shoulders and face and a knot on his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Police spokesman Brian Schellman called the assertion "completely false" while noting that the suspect was seen by a nurse when he was booked into the county jail, standard procedure for all incoming inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He added that Williams did not resist arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Christmas also suggested that police coerced a statement by Williams in which he reportedly admitted to the shooting but said he wasn't targeting police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Schellman also rejected that assertion, noting the statement was videotaped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Williams, shackled at the waist and feet, was led into a jury room Tuesday, where he was photographed, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He was then returned to county lock-up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Christmas said some of the injuries are visible in a police mug shot distributed Sunday, the Post-Dispatch reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said red marks can be seen on his client's throat and cheek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Williams is accused of shooting the two officers early Thursday outside Ferguson's police station, which has been the scene of protests since last summer's fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Williams was arrested Sunday on charges of felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In his interview with the AP on Monday, Christmas countered an earlier description by St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar of the March 12 shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"This wasn't any type of ambush shooting," Christmas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Those officers were shot accidentally."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Christmas later said in other media interviews that Williams didn't fire the shots at the officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He did not respond to several messages Tuesday seeking to clarify the discrepancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Police have said Williams told investigators he was aiming instead at someone with whom he had a dispute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But that assertion was met with skepticism by St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We're not sure we completely buy that part of it," the prosecutor said Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Christmas told the AP he wasn't aware of any details regarding a possible dispute that could have preceded the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The shooting happened as a demonstration began to break up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The protest followed the resignation of city Police Chief Tom Jackson in the wake of a Justice Department report that found widespread racial bias in the city's police practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Williams is jailed on $300,000 bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Ferguson Police Department has been a national focal point since Brown, who was black and unarmed, was killed by police officer Darren Wilson, who is white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A grand jury declined to indict Wilson in November, and Wilson was cleared of civil rights charges by a Justice Department report released March 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Wilson resigned in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A separate Justice Department report found widespread racial bias in the city's policing and in a municipal court system driven by profit extracted from mostly black and low-income residents.</td></tr>
