<h3>AP confuses Robert Durst with Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The original AP post, released on monday evening read: "A Louisiana State Police trooper says millionaire Robert Durst has been booked on weapons charges in that state &#x2013; on top of a first-degree murder charge lodged by Los Angeles authorities. Trooper Melissa Matey told the Associated Press that an arrest warrant was issued for the former Limp Bizkit frontman and he was rebooked in the Orleans Parish Jail on Monday under two new charges."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The correction, issued this morning, stated: "The Associated Press reported erroneously that Robert Durst is a member of a band. He is a real estate heir; Fred Durst is the former frontman of Limp Bizkit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Durst (that's Robert Durst, in case you're still confused) was arrested for murder on Saturday, after new evidence, uncovered during the making of the The Jinx, linked him to the death of his friend Susan Berman in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The millionaire real estate heir first came to public attention in 1982, after his wife, Katheleen, disappeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two people connected to the case and to Durst &#x2013; Berman and Durst's neighbour, Morris Black &#x2013; were later found murdered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Durst was tried for Black's murder in 2003, after a period on the run, but was later acquitted, after claiming that he had killed the 71-year-old in self defence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the final moments of The Jink, broadcast in the US on Sunday night, Durst was recorded saying: "What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Fred Durst is currently preparing to introduce the world to Stampede of the Disco Elephants, an unreleased Limp Bizkit album.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The US nu metal band went on hiatus in 2004, but reformed in 2009.</td></tr>
