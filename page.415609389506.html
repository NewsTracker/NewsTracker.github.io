<h3>Suge Knight collapses after bail is set at $25 million</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Los Angeles Fire Department officials wheeled a gurney into the courtroom and assisted Knight, who was unconscious, his attorney said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Just, bam," Matthew Fletcher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"He's unconscious right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Knight was taken to a jail hospital ward where he was being evaluated, said Nicole Nishida, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Deputy District Attorney Cynthia J. Barnes said she believed Knight "did it in front of the cameras."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>During the hearing to discuss the former rapper's bail on murder and other charges, Knight's left shoulder was twitching and he appeared to tense up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In court, Fletcher argued for a lower bail amount, saying Knight was not a flight risk because he was recognizable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"If his name wasn't Suge Knight, they wouldn't have filed this case," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Barnes said she didn't believe a $25 million bail was high enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>To back up the claim, Barnes documented the Death Row Records co-founder's extensive brushes with the law in nearly 300 pages of written arguments and supporting evidence, including more than two dozen police reports and an affidavit that implicate Knight in robberies, extortion, money laundering, assaults, witness intimidation and battery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"When I wrote this, I was appalled he basically is above the law," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>-Knight is suspected of extorting "taxes" from rappers and athletes who want to work in Los Angeles or Las Vegas, according to a sworn affidavit submitted by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Richard Biddle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>-Knight and a woman in Las Vegas are also involved in laundering more than $10 million since 2002 through a network of bank accounts, according to Biddle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>-In 2014, a man told the LAPD that Knight held him at gunpoint for about 10 minutes in an alleyway and repeatedly vowed to kill him, according to a police report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Barnes listed 31 incidents in the last decade in which Knight was accused of acting violently or threatening to do so, beginning with a 2004 report of a woman who claimed that, on Knight's orders, she was punched in the face outside the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She later refused to cooperate with police, citing a fear of retaliation by Knight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Knight's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Knight is accused of deliberately running over Terry Carter, 55, and Cle "Bone" Sloan, 51, in a restaurant parking lot on Jan. 29 following an argument on the set for a commercial about the film "Straight Outta Compton."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Carter died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Knight is charged with murder, attempted murder and two counts of hit-and-run with an allegation that he committed a violent felony while out on bail in another case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The court documents highlight that the production of "Straight Outta Compton" sparked Knight's anger last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The morning after Carter's death, Knight was arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Initially his bail was set at around $2 million, but revoked on Feb. 2 after Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officials argued that he was a possible flight risk and had "witness intimidation issues."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They also cited his criminal past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Prosecutors cannot request that Knight be held without bail because no special circumstance allegations have been filed against him, in accordance with the county's bail schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In seeking such a high amount, Barnes noted that at the time of Carter's death, Knight was out on bail in the case of an alleged robbery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He and Micah "Katt" Williams are accused of stealing a Beverly Hills photographer's camera in the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>5 incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Not only did he disregard the constraints of bail, he escalated his criminal behavior to murder and attempted murder," Barnes wrote.</td></tr>

<h3>March Madness 2015: Winners And Losers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>And so far, not too much damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A couple of number three seeds went down yesterday, but not really enough to wreak havoc in office pools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Joining us for March Madness update in both the men's and women's tournaments is NPR's sports correspondent Tom Goldman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hey, Tom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Hi, Don.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>GONYEA: So like yesterday, 16 games today with the men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Any noteworthy results to report?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>GOLDMAN: Well, no real madness so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The higher seeds are winning, including number two Kansas and number two Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And over yesterday and today all the five seeds beat the 12 seeds seeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And 12 over five has been a common occurrence in recent years, but not this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>GONYEA: You were courtside in Portland, Ore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>yesterday for a lot of basketball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That actually sounds like a lot of fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Any impressions to share?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>GOLDMAN: Well, first I want to share a locker room moment, Don.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>When I went into the Texas Southern locker room after the team had lost to Arizona by 21, I wanted to interview one particular player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And the guy in the locker next to his offered me his chair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>GONYEA: (Laughter).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>GOLDMAN: These guys, obviously, still are kids who respect the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That will change if they move on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>On the court - so many great players who will never get close to playing professionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>One guy you probably will see in the NBA - Arizona forward Stanley Johnson, the Pac-12 freshman of the year, and I saw why yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The way he moves around the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He doesn't so much run as he flows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He knocks down three-pointers effortlessly and he can elevate to shocking heights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And he doesn't even look like he's working hard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He's an important piece in a very good Arizona team that's considered one of the few that can challenge mighty Kentucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>And in general out there, Don, tough physical defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>There's definitely more than a touch of football in the men's college game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>GONYEA: Rough defense has been identified as one of the culprits for slowing down the games in recent years and inhibiting the kind of scoring that fans really like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Are we seeing that broadly - widely in this tournament?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>GOLDMAN: Well, yeah, you are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>I mean, it's part of the men's game now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Of the 32 teams of that played yesterday, I was lucky enough to see one of the two that scored in the nineties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>That was Arizona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But the average scoring yesterday was 65 points per team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>That's not a lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>There is concern over the decline of offense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It was voiced recently by saving CBS analyst Seth Davis in a kind of manifesto he wrote this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>It was dramatically titled "Crisis On The Court."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>And it offered remedies for how to pick up scoring and the pace of games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>There's still a lot of love for the men's college basketball and a lot of money being generated at the top level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>But will that pot of gold continue if the game starts to turn off the casual fan who wants exciting, high-scoring basketball?</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>GONYEA: The women's tournament starts today - 16 games today and then tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>We've heard all about defending champ, UConn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Give us some of the other highlights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>GOLDMAN: Other number one seeds will be fun to watch - South Carolina, Maryland, Notre Dame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Princeston, the only undefeated team, was named and 8 seed, which was kind of a slap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>And Princeton with a chip on its shoulder should be fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>As far as players, Notre Dame freshman forward Brianna Turner, a rugged defender who could help in a match against mighty UConn, Princeton guard Blake Dietrick, the team's leading scorer and big part of the Tiger's success and, of course, the Kevin Durant of women's basketball, tall and talented Breanna Stewart for the UConn Huskies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>She can score inside and out - the best player out there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>That's just a few.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>There are more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Sometimes the tournament brings out stars we don't even anticipate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>GONYEA: And we're out of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Thanks, Tom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>GOLDMAN: You bet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>GONYEA: That's NPR's sports correspondent Tom Goldman with an update on March Madness.</td></tr>
