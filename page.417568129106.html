<h3>One Direction 'not splitting up'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson opened Capital's Summertime Ball with Vodafone at Wembley Stadium, after playing their first UK gig as a foursome in Cardiff last night, since Malik left the group in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Payne batted away the rumours, saying backstage before they performed: "We don't know where that came from because we've got loads of stuff going on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have just started the process for recording the new album, we've got a whole new tour going on, there are some really good songs so I don't think we are going anywhere for a while."</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>They are playing two stadiums in one day and will rush back to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff for tonight's gig after the Wembley show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Payne said of their new material: "We've just been rehearsing the new songs at the minute so it'll take time. We want to get that right - get it right in motion and it'll arise somewhere I'm sure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Styles added: "As time goes on, we will keep adding to them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Payne also said that Malik's absence has been missed, although he joked about the 22-year-old singer's soulful vocals.</td></tr>
