<h3>Liberia schools reopen after 6-month Ebola closure</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Pupils who trickled in to Saint Michael High School on the outskirts of the capital also washed their hands with chlorinated water before going inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I feel happy to come to school today because for so long I have not seen my friends," Albert Kollie, 18, told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I am very happy to be counted among the living and I pray that Ebola be eradicated from this country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Many students said they had grown tired of sitting at home, and at least one principal said teenage pregnancy had spiked during the six-month school gap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A few, though, remained a bit fearful about returning even though there are just a handful of Ebola cases left in the country that once saw 100 new patients a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We will be afraid to touch each other in class, some colleagues will be afraid to come around," high school junior Eric Blackie said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But we cannot just be sitting home."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Liberia has seen the highest death toll from the Ebola epidemic, with 3,800 killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In neighboring Guinea where the outbreak began, schools already have reopened though many fearful parents have kept their children home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In Sierra Leone, where disease transmission is now the highest, officials hope to reopen schools by the end of March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Deputy Education Minister Remses Kumbuyah said more than 5,000 kits were distributed to schools that included thermometers and chlorine for hand-washing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We are asking all the school administrators to ensure that a classroom should not have more than 45 or 50 students."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Overcrowding is a major problem in Liberia's schools, where as many as 100 pupils may be in a single classroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since Ebola is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, administrators want to minimize the potential spread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Health officials have warned that a single new case could trigger a whole new cluster of infections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nearly 9,200 people have died since the first Ebola deaths in rural Guinea in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The disease ravaged through Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - all countries with weak health systems that were ill-prepared for such an epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In Sierra Leone on Monday, the government promised a full investigation after an internal audit found that nearly one-third of the money it received to fight Ebola was used without saving the necessary receipts and invoices to justify the spending.</td></tr>
