<tr><td colspan=6><p>NEW YORK (AP) - It's taken six years for Matthew Morrison to get back on Broadway so it's no surprise he knows a thing or two about where he ended up.</p><p>"I just imagine her welcome guests back in her pearls and everything," Morrison said, sipping tea.</p><p>Morrison, 36, plays J.M. Barrie, the "Peter Pan" author, in the adaptation from the 2004 whimsical film of the same name about a widow whose four young sons inspired Barrie to write the children's classic.</p><p>"There's nothing more challenging or exciting than doing a brand new Broadway show," said Morrison.</p><p>The show ended earlier this year and Morrison's last scene was of him singing "Teach Your Children" by Crosby Stills, Nash & Young in dedication to all his fictional students, many who are in tears by the end of the song.</p><p>Morrison barely had time to say goodbye to Schuester before it was time to tackle Barrie.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2>2015-03-24 15:17:04</td><td colspan=2><a href=page.415704810241.html>sentences</a></td><td colspan=2><a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article16170860.html#storylink=rss">site</a></td></tr>

Mahal told The Times at a performance Morrison gave last summer outside his hometown of Belfast.</p></td></tr></table></body></div></html>
