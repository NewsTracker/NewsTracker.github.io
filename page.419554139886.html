<h3>Swiss advance bid to return $40 million stolen from Tunisia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Swiss official says his country has made headway toward returning some $40 million that was stolen from the Tunisian state and has been sitting in Swiss banks since Tunisia's longtime regime collapsed in the Arab Spring uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Valentin Zellweger, a legal adviser to the Swiss government, said Monday the federal prosecutor and highest court still have to take steps in the restitution case, but that the process has come a long way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Zellweger declined to specify who had deposited the money in Switzerland, but said it wasn't former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled Tunisia during the 2011 uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"In the Tunisian case, we are pretty well advanced," he told reporters in Bern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Switzerland is preparing legislation on the restitution of funds stolen by powerful people and kept in Swiss banks - once notorious as favored monetary hideaways among dictators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Zellweger estimated that thousands of such "politically exposed persons" currently have accounts of that kind in Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He and other Swiss officials say their country is at the forefront of such restitution efforts around the world, having returned some $1.8 billion in so-called "potentate funds" in the last three decades - including money once in the hands of former dictators like Nigeria's Sani Abacha and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In March, Swiss authorities announced their country would hand over more than $120 million to Brazil that was frozen as part of corruption probes involving Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras.</td></tr>
