<h3>Ousted Egypt president starts latest trial on spying charge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The hearing was swiftly adjourned and a new date set for Feb. 28 after the court ruled that the defense should consult with Mohammed Morsi and the other 10 defendants in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Morsi faces several other ongoing trials, including one where he stands charged with inciting the killing of protesters and for which he could face the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Other charges have yet to be brought to trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Morsi was Egypt's first democratically elected leader, but his turbulent one-year rule left the country sharply divided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>From the defendant's cage in the courtroom Sunday, Morsi said, "I am the legitimate president... and this trial is a farce."</td></tr>
