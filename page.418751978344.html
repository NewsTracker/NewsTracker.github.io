<h3>Been there, done that - it's all on Google Maps app</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google is introducing a new feature to its Maps application that allows users to see where they have been on any given day, month or year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The search company already tracks the location of Android users, as long as they choose to share their location history with Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This allows the company to provide more relevant and contextualised information within applications and ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For example, Google Now provides notifications when there are traffic incidents along your commute, or reminds you where you parked your car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new feature, called Timeline, puts this information on to a map, letting users "visualise your real-world routines, easily see the trips you've taken and get a glimpse of the places where you spend your time", according to Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>People who use Google Photos - Google's new app that assigns tags to objects in photos and automatically arranges them into albums - can also see all the photos they took in a specific place or on a specific day on their Timeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Have you ever wanted a way to easily remember all the places you've been - whether it's a museum you visited during your last vacation or that fun bar you stumbled upon a few months ago?" said Google product manager Gerard Sanz in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Well, starting today, Google Maps can help ... Your Timeline is private and visible only to you; and you control the locations you choose to keep."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The new feature is available on desktop and Android.</td></tr>
