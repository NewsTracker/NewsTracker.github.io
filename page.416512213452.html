<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will face the firing squad on Tuesday unless Indonesia's president has a last-minute change of heart.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>"I spoke to Mr Sukumaran's mother Raji yesterday and assured her the government would continue to seek clemency from Indonesian President Widodo for both men," she said in a statement.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>"Andrew, he's OK. Basically, they looked tough."</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>However, Filipina Mary Jane Veloso has a second appeal application before the courts and Indonesian Zainal Abidin is still awaiting a decision on his.</td></tr>
