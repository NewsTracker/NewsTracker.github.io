<h3>Greece's leftist leaders reject call to miss debt payment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>File-This March 20, 2015, file photo shows Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras gesturing toward the press as he leaves an EU summit in Brussels.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece will continue paying its debts, after its ruling Radical Left Coalition narrowly rejected a call by party hardliners to miss its next International Monetary Fund loan payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Syriza's central committee rejected the proposal Sunday by far left hardliners 95-75, with one blank vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It also rejected calls to nationalize banks and hold a referendum that would give voters the power to reject any deal in Brussels with the EU and IMF over relief in exchange for more fiscal reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This was just the latest push in Greece to miss an IMF payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last week, Nikos Filis, the leader of the party's parliamentary group, said Greece's cash crunch is so tight that it might not be able to make a June 5 payment of 300 million euros ($330 million).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece owes a total of 1.56 billion euros ($1.72 billion) in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It has not received bailout aid since August and the European Central Bank has provided less help lately to Greek banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Party hardliners known as the Left Platform invoke non-payment as a matter of principle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Most Syriza officials, however, use the threat as a means to pressure lenders to provide immediate relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The party instead approved a text which claims the government will not sign a deal based on previous bailout agreements and rejects "ultimatums" by "the austerity fanatics."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Still, Syriza believes a "mutually advantageous" deal can emerge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier Sunday, Left Platform leader Panayiotis Lafazanis, a cabinet minister overseeing energy, the environment and agriculture, declared that "it would not be a catastrophe to exit the euro (nor) a terrorist act not to pay the next installment to the IMF."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Lafazanis dismissed Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' view that progress has been achieved in negotiations with lenders and said Greece has never been under such "harsh blackmail."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said lenders want to "annihilate" Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis, a senior Syriza member who doesn't belong to the Left Platform, said in a TV interview Sunday that Greece can't pay the IMF installments.</td></tr>
