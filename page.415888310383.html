<h3>ACTU turns its back on Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mr Ferguson, who once led the trade union movement, has angered senior figures in the party by supporting coalition plans to privatise part of the NSW electricity network at the height of the state election campaign, and publicly denouncing Labor's stance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Martin is doing what Martin is paid to do," ACTU secretary Dave Oliver told ABC radio, describing Mr Ferguson as a well-paid mouthpiece for the mining sector.</td></tr>
