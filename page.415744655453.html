<tr><td>28</td><td>''It's so weird to play a great first quarter and then suddenly it just goes away.</td></tr>

<tr><td>43</td><td>''No, we did not call that,'' Popovich said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Westbrook took umbrage when questioned about the team's defensive struggles recently.</td></tr>
