<h3>Georgia waffles on execution with cloudy drug, lawyers say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The execution of Kelly Renee Gissendaner was delayed late Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A day later, they decided to temporarily halt executions until they could more carefully analyze the pentobarbital, which is supposed to be clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"If it's a solution that's supposed to be clear and it's not clear, it should never be injected," said Michael Jay, a professor at the University of North Carolina's Eshelman School of Pharmacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"So they did the right thing by not injecting it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The cloudy drug bolstered death penalty opponents, who have been vocal in their opposition after three botched executions in other parts of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gissendaner, who was convicted of murder in the February 1997 slaying of her husband, had originally been set for execution last week on Feb. 25, but it was postponed because of a threat of bad weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Attorneys for Gissendaner said in a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court that a lawyer for the state called them around 10:25 p.m. Monday to say the execution would be postponed several days because the state's pharmacist had looked at the drug an hour earlier and determined it was cloudy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The state's lawyer called back about five minutes later to say the prison wasn't sure which drugs they had checked, "this week's or last week's," and that they were considering going forward, the filing says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The lawyer called a third time, saying "this particular batch (of drugs) just didn't come out like it was supposed to" and they weren't going to proceed, according to the court filing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>About 11 p.m., the state told reporters an independent lab checked its potency and it was acceptable, but it later appeared cloudy and the execution was postponed "out of an abundance of caution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The back and forth was detailed in Gissendaner's emergency motion for a stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said "there was never any confusion within the department about the drugs which were to be used," but also indicated the department was not part of the conversations between the attorney general's office and defense attorneys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said in a statement it is "essential that executions are carried out in a constitutional manner" and that he approved of the decision to temporarily suspend executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The cloudiness could be contamination by bacteria or some impurity, said Jay, the pharmacy professor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>If the particles were big enough, they could clog blood vessels when injected or could lodge in the lungs, Jay said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It could also make the drug less potent, making an inmate very sleepy but not kill them, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Compounded drugs have a shelf life of 30 days, Jay said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Corrections officials declined to say when the department obtained the drug or when it was set to expire.</td></tr>

<h3>TV tonight: 'Empire,' 'Black-ish,' 'Nashville'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's too bad Empire and Nashville aren't on the same network: A crossover would be intriguing, to say the least, and far more fun than ABC's attempt tonight to use Nashville to promote its morning show.</td></tr>
