<h3>Rescue teams reach cyclone stricken Vanuatu islands, official death toll lowered</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Residents of the southern Vanuatu island of Tanna said they were running out of food and basic supplies on Tuesday, after a huge cyclone tore across the South Pacific nation wreaking widespread devastation but not the heavy death toll initially feared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Relief workers were still battling to reach many of the islands pummelled by Cyclone Pam's gusts of more than 300 kilometres an hour on Friday and Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With communications cut off and reconnaissance flights revealing destroyed houses, shredded forests and damaged buildings, international aid agencies had been particularly worried about Tanna, which bore the full force of the storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A Reuters witness on the island of 29,000 people, about 200 km south of the capital, said that while damage was extensive, it appeared most of the population had survived by sheltering in schools, churches and other sturdy buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"People sheltered in school buildings. We were helping one another," Ropate Vuso, 67, told Reuters in Tanna township.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are running short of food, water, shelter and electricity. We have no communications, we are still waiting for the people from parliament, the chief and the president, but still nobody is coming."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There were unconfirmed reports of four deaths in and around the main town of Tanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Oxfam's Vanuatu country manager, Colin Collett van Rooyen, said an assessment flight over the island of Erromango - north of Tanna, with a population of around 2,000 - had revealed huge damage there too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"What we have seen is damage in some villages, at the upper range, of 70, 80, 90 per cent, one village in particular 100 per cent," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"These are small villages but massive destruction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Aircraft flying over other outlying islands had seen large white Hs marked out on the ground, or residents trying to signal for help with mirrors, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The United Nations said on Tuesday the official death toll from the cyclone was 11, revising down its earlier figure of 24, but many officials anticipate that number would rise once they are able to more thoroughly inspect the outer islands of the scattered archipelago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In Vanuatu's capital, Port Vila, the cleanup was progressing after trees were uprooted and homes flattened, but there were worries about food scarcity and health after the main local food market was destroyed and the city's hospital severely damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bishop said Australia was sending a 20-strong emergency medical assistance team of doctors, nurses, paramedics and a pharmacist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They plan to set up a temporary ward in the car park of the damaged Port Vila hospital capable of treating up to 40 patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Thousands are still staying in shelters overnight, with a 6pm-6am curfew in place to prevent looting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The majority of locals rely on foods sold at the downtown market such as taro, island cabbage, bananas, kumara and yams for their staple diet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Shops selling tinned food were open and stocked in the capital, but many locals do not have the money to buy them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We have water, but the situation is very bad because people don't have local food," shop owner Colette Calvo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"All they can eat is food like bananas that they pick up off the ground and they can get sick."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Australia, which has already sent five planes with personnel and humanitarian supplies, dispatched another three planes on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It also began loading its emergency response ship HMAS Tobruk, which is capable of driving onto beaches, for possible deployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A French navy ship was also being sent from nearby New Caledonia, while a U.S. Marine Corps-based Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief team was also being made ready, Australian defense officials said.</td></tr>

<h3>Genius Monkey nabs $2 million in funding</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 20-employee company plans to hire five "sophisticated" coders, five sales reps and five account managers by the end of the second quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CEO Clint Ethington said the company is "pretty unique" in that it's not an agency, but a software digital marketing company that manages other companies' digital marketing advertising programmatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Using real-time bidding across all the networks (Google, Facebook, Yahoo, etc.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>, we brought them all into one single console to place your ads to all the networks instead of independently," said Ethington, who lives in Tucson but is moving to Chandler in June. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Profiles are put together on consumers based on their internet and credit use, layering in demographic information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Genius Monkey can then target advertising to these specific people who match the profiles for their clients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Programmatic advertising is changing by the day," Ethington said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We feel we are ahead of the curve, but we need to burst our engines up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The companies Genius Monkey works with ask not to be identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, Ethington said his company works with auto dealerships, home builders, medical weight loss companies and veterinarian groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We're geared as their secret sauce," Ethington said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We're like the back end for an agency."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The company's first round of funding from Dallas-based Cypress Growth Capital LLC was favorable because of the investment firm's royalty-based growth capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cypress is the first, largest and most active royalty-based growth capital firm in the U.S. with $80 million of committed capital across two funds.</td></tr>
