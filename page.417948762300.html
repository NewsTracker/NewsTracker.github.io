<h3>German authorities detain Al Jazeera journalist at Egypt's request</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Al Jazeera journalist Ahmed Mansour was arrested on the request of Egypt while trying to board a flight to Doha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A high-profile Al Jazeera journalist has been arrested in Germany at the request of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ahmed Mansour, a leading talk show host on the channel's Arabic service, has been remanded in custody after an extradition hearing before a German judge, Al Jazeera said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mansour's arrest is the latest in a string of such cases brought by the Egyptian authorities against Al Jazeera journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egypt accuses Al Jazeera of being a mouthpiece of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Qatar-backed Islamist movement which president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi toppled in 2013 when he was army chief and accuses of being a terrorist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Both the television channel and the Brotherhood reject the allegations made by Egyptian authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The German authorities told me that we are dealing with an international criminal case," Mansour told Al Jazeera by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cairo's criminal court sentenced Mansour, who has dual Egyptian and British citizenship, to 15 years in prison in absentia last year on the charge of torturing a lawyer in 2011 in Tahrir Square, the focus of the popular uprising that toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Al Jazeera said at the time the charge was false and an attempt to silence Mansour, known to viewers across the Arab world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Saad Djebbar, a lawyer for Al Jazeera, said Mansour was arrested unexpectedly on Saturday as he tried to board a Qatar Airways flight to Doha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This is a very serious development," Mr Djebbar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We knew that the Egyptians were going to set such a trap to harass our journalists and that is what has happened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A spokesman for the German Federal Police said a 52-year-old man was arrested at Berlin's Tegel airport following an international arrest warrant from the Egyptian authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman Badr Abdelatty said Egypt was coordinating with the German authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He is accused of a crime and was sentenced so of course we have called for him to be returned," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Critics accuse the West of turning a blind eye towards what they say is Egypt's crackdown on dissent and freedom of speech in favour of improved economic ties and regional security cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Sisi visited Germany earlier in June at chancellor Angela Merkel's invitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The head of Germany's parliament cancelled a meeting with him, citing rights violations in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Deputy head of the Left Party in Germany's parliament Wolfgang Gehrcke on Sunday said he did not support Mansour's extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Everyone knows that the rule of law in Egypt is built on sand - if you can even speak of a rule of law. Of course we can't extradite him. In countries where there is the death penalty, there should be no extraditions in general," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Cairo government denies allegations of widespread human rights abuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Egypt released Australian Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste in February this year after 400 days in prison on charges that included aiding a terrorist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mohamed Fahmy, a naturalised Canadian who has given up his Egyptian citizenship, and Egyptian Baher Mohamed were released on bail in February after spending more than a year in custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The journalists were originally sentenced to between seven and 10 years in prison on charges including spreading lies to help a terrorist organisation, which they have denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Egypt's High Court ordered a retrial in January.</td></tr>
