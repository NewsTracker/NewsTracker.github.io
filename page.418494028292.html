<h3>Greece reaches deal with creditors, avoids euro exit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, speaks with French President Francois Hollande, center, and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras during a meeting of eurozone heads of state at the EU Council building in Brussels on Sunday, July 12, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Skeptical European creditors raced Sunday to narrow differences both among themselves and with Athens, aiming to come up with a tentative agreement to stave off an immediate financial collapse in Greece that would reverberate across the continent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After months of acrimony, Greece finally clinched a bailout agreement with its European creditors on Monday that will, if implemented, secure the country's place in the euro and avoid financial collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The terms of the deal, however, will be painful both for Greeks and their radical left-led government, which since its election in January had vowed to stand up to the creditors and reject the budget cuts they have been demanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Before it can get 85 billion euros ($95.07 billion) in bailout cash and support for its banks to reopen, the Greek government will have to pass a raft of austerity measures that include sales tax increases, reforms to pensions, and labor market reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece will be on a tight timetable to implement its reforms - a reflection of how little its creditors trust the government to honor a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras infuriated his European partners last month when he called for a popular vote against economic reforms the creditors has proposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Greek people voted against those proposals, but will be horrified to see that they now face even tougher measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both sides acknowledged the bitterness that marked their negotiations and kept them negotiating nine hours past a Sunday midnight deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Trust needs to be rebuilt," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, adding that with the deal, "Greece has a chance to return to the path of growth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a first step toward getting its bailout loans, the Greek government has to pass a set of measures into law by Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Measures include an increase in the sales tax and reform of the pension system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In later weeks, Greece will have to open to competition industries that have long been protected, such as the energy sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Labor laws will be made more flexible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>If it meets these requirements, Greece will get a three-year rescue program and a commitment to restructure its debt, which is unsustainably high at around 320 billion euros, or around 180 percent of annual GDP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tsipras argues that because of these concessions Monday's deal is, despite the tough austerity, actually better for Greece than the proposals Greeks voted down just a week ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We managed to avoid the most extreme measures," Tsipras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Greece will fight to return to growth and to reclaim its lost sovereignty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said he had managed to avoid a demand by some creditors to transfer Greek assets abroad as a form of collateral and to avoid the collapse of the banking sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Greeks seemed mainly relieved that the country was not facing financial collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This was a necessary step for the country to emerge from the dead ends that had been created in the last few years," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Greece's banks, which have been shut for two weeks, were still closed on Monday and limits remained on cash withdrawals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Without a deal, they faced the prospect of collapse within days as they are steadily drained of money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>When the banks will be able to reopen will depend on whether the European Central Bank decides to increase emergency credit to Greek banks now that a bailout deal with Greece has been clinched in principle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It was unclear whether the ECB would make such a decision on Monday or after Greece passes its first batch of reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>French President Francois Hollande said the Greek parliament would convene within hours to adopt the reforms called for in the plan and he celebrated Greece's continued membership in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Losing Greece, he said, would have been akin to losing "the heart of our civilization."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Other European officials were less emotive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"The Greeks have to show they're credible, show that they mean it," said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers and a longtime critic of the Tsipras government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The creditors said they would help Greece in the short term deal with its debt repayments since any bailout agreement was not imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Greece will need help making a 4.2 billion euro debt repayment on July 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It is also in arrears on about 1.5 billion euros owed to the International Monetary Fund since June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>If the talks had failed, Greece could have faced bankruptcy and a possible exit from the euro, the European single currency that the country has been a part of since 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>No country has ever left the joint currency, which launched in 1999, and there is no mechanism in place for one to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Greece had requested a three-year, 53.5 billion-euro ($59.5 billion) financial package, but that number grew larger by tens of billions as the negotiations dragged on and the leaders calculated how much Greece will need to stay solvent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Greece has received two previous bailouts, totaling 240 billion euros ($268 billion), in return for deep spending cuts, tax increases and reforms from successive governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Although the country's annual budget deficit has come down dramatically, Greece's debt burden has increased as the economy has shrunk by a quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, sitting center, goes over papers with members of his delegation during a round table meeting of eurogroup finance ministers at the EU Lex building in Brussels on Sunday, July 12, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Greece has another chance Sunday to convince skeptical European creditors that it can be trusted to enact wide-ranging economic reforms which would safeguard its future in the common euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos, right, speaks with Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde during a round table meeting of eurogroup finance ministers at the EU Lex building in Brussels on Sunday, July 12, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>A presidential guard, right, stands guard at the tomb of the unknown soldier as riot police officers guard one of the entrances to the parliament during a demonstration of supporters of the no vote in central Athens, Sunday, July 12, 2015.</td></tr>
