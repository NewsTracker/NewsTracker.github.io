<h3>After 10-hour wait for wind, Dustin Johnson leads British (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- For all the debate over whether the British Open should have started Saturday, Dustin Johnson only cared about the finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A second round that lasted nearly 39 hours due to rain one day and a raging wind the next finally ended with Johnson driving the 18th green and taking two putts from 150 feet for birdie and a 3-under 69.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That gave him a one-shot lead over Danny Willett of England, who for the second straight year did not hit a single shot in the British Open on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last year it was because he missed the cut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This time it was because he finished his second round Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And there were plenty on the Old Course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Brooks Koepka refused to play when his ball wouldn't stay still on the 11th green.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jordan Spieth three-putted five times in one round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tiger Woods posted his highest 36-hole in the British Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rarest of all is that the wind delay that lasted more than 10 hours forced the first Monday finish in 27 years at the British Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Not so peculiar was Johnson atop the leaderboard at 10-under 134.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Paul Lawrie, the 46-year-old Scot who won a crazy Open at Carnoustie in 1999, played bogey-free over the final 14 holes for a 70 and was two shots behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Louis Oosthuizen (70) and Jason Day (71) joined the large group at 7-under 137 that included Adam Scott and Zach Johnson, who finished Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Spieth, going after the third leg of the Grand Slam, shot 72 and was five behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One month after a three-putt from 12 feet cost him a shot at the U.S. Open, Johnson walked the Old Course with a swagger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He did enough damage Friday that even a couple of bogeys didn't get him off track, and he showed in the short time he played Saturday he could handle the wind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''Every aspect of your game is challenged,'' Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As gusts began to top 40 mph when the second round resumed in the morning, Johnson chose to chip up the steep slope at the front of the par-5 14th green.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He didn't hit quite hard enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And then, the player with a reputation of being it too much of a hurry at the majors made the mistake of taking his time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>An inch away from placing his coin behind the ball to mark it, a gust moved his ball and it picked up enough momentum to roll off the green and cause Spieth to jump out of the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Three putts later, Johnson had his second bogey of the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>One hole later, the R&A realized it was too windy to continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Johnson returned nearly 11 hours later, made two solid pars and finished with his birdie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It was the fourth time in the last six rounds at the majors that he has had at least a share of lead, though not when it mattered - at the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>This might be his best chance yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Spieth three-putted for par on the 14th hole and swiped his putter in disgust as leaving two of those putts short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He had another three-putt from about 90 feet on the 17th hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But he stayed in the game by driving the 18th green for a birdie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''I believe I'm still in contention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I still believe I can win this tournament,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But after spending two days playing alongside Johnson, he also realized a third straight major will require some help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''I need a really solid round tomorrow because Dustin is not letting up,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The second round didn't finish Friday because a burst of heavy rain flooded the course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>That was nothing compared with the gusts off the Eden Estuary, and the R&A knew it was going to be on the edge to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>R&A officials said they spent an hour on the 11th green - the most exposed part of the golf course - to make sure golf balls weren't moving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>And then it started, and Koepka's ball wouldn't stay put.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He took nearly 30 minutes to hit one putt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He kept marking his golf ball and protesting with a rules official and finally said he wouldn't play when his ball moved a couple of inches on three occasions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A few holes ahead, Oosthuizen putted up to 3 feet on the 13th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>A gust blew it a few feet away and, as the South African laughed at the absurdity, it moved about 8 feet away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>It was the third straight time that an Open at St. Andrews was halted by wind - 2010 for the British Open and 2013 for the Women's British Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The fullest grandstand was behind the driving range as players kept trying to stay loose in case the wind subsided, and it finally did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Ultimately, what mattered was the finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Just not for Woods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>He never had a realistic chance of making the cut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Needing mostly birdies, he resumed his round with three straight bogeys and shot 75 to finish his two rounds at 7-over 151.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>That was his highest 36-hole ever in the British Open, one month after his highest 36-hole total ever (156) to miss the cut in the U.S. Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Willett, meanwhile, also came to the golf course to practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>''We had it yesterday, but they've had an extremely long day today,'' Willett said.</td></tr>
