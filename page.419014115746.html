<tr><td>7</td><td>The disciplinary action comes two days after prosecutors in Florida dropped a battery charge for causing bodily harm against Kromer for allegedly confronting two boys for using his beach chairs, pushing one to the ground and punching him in the face last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An arrest report released by the Walton County Sheriff's Office said Kromer threatened to kill one of the boy's families if he reported the incident.</td></tr>
