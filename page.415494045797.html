<h3>Boston Marathon bombing trial enters 3rd week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this courtroom sketch, Dun Meng, far right, testifies with a translator at his side during the federal death penalty trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in Boston, on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BOSTON (AP) - Jurors in the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Monday visited the bullet-riddled boat in which he was captured days after the deadly blast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The jurors walked around the outside of the boat and peered inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tsarnaev, flanked by three attorneys and U.S. marshals, watched impassively from a table about 50 feet away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The red and white boat is covered with more than 100 bullet holes marked individually with small pieces of white evidence tape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One of the boat's two front widows is shot out almost completely, with just one shattered piece of glass remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jurors walked around the boat, taking notes, and then went two at a time onto a lift so they could look inside the vessel, which was on a trailer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Inside the boat, called the Slipaway II, they could see the note Tsarnaev wrote in which he denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The note, written in pencil, is speckled with at least 10 bullet holes and stained with long streaks of blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements that he participated in the bombings and the later crimes, but said his slain older brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind who recruited the then 19-year-old Dzhokhar to help him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Prosecutors say Tsarnaev was a full and willing participant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Now 21, he faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The same jury that decides guilt will decide whether he receives life in prison or the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 injured in the attack.</td></tr>
