<h3>Republicans feast on crow, saying food stamps for poor like feeding park animals</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OKLAHOMA CITY - A regional branch of the Republican Party is apologizing for saying on Facebook that giving low-income Americans food vouchers is akin to feeding animals in national parks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Randy Brogdon, chairman of the Oklahoma Republican Party, said Tuesday on Facebook that the post was intended to illustrate the cycle of government dependency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He apologized "for any misconceptions that were created."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The original message, posted Monday, says 46 million Americans participate in the national food assistance program, commonly referred to as food stamps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The post then says the National Park Service encourages people not to feed wild animals because they "will grow dependent on handouts and will not learn to take care of themselves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The post concludes: "Thus ends today's lesson in irony."</td></tr>
