<h3>Google Photos uploads pics even after you uninstall</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Android users, check your settings!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>When Google Photos was released in May, it received glowing reviews from users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The service is designed to compete with the likes of Flickr, Dropbox, and Apple iCloud, offering unlimited photo and video storage and apps for Android, iOS, and PC web browsers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But if you're one of the few who tried the service, didn't like it, and deleted the app, you might be in for a nasty surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If you're using an Android Device, it may still be uploading your shots to Google Photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The quirk has so far only been confirmed on Android devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The quirk, which so far has only been confirmed on Android devices, was discovered by David A. Arnott of the Nashville Business Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He noticed that hundreds of his family photos had appeared on Google Photos, even after he deleted the app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The reason why is pretty simple: Your phone checks its core Google settings-as opposed to the settings in the Google Photos app itself-to determine whether images should be backed up to the Google cloud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If you want to tell your device to stop uploading, simply turn photo backup off in the Google Settings menu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>(Go to Google Settings > Google Photo Backup.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There's no word yet on whether Google plans to address this quirk in future updates, but our hunch is that they probably will.</td></tr>
