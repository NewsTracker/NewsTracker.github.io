<h3>Can Apple Music win the hearts of Spotify's fans?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Can Apple Music win the hearts of Spotify's fans?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Is there enough going for Apple Music to make you switch from Spotify?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple's new streaming service launched on Tuesday last week and now critics are weighing in on whether it does too much or too little - but not many seem to think the Cupertino-based company got it just right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Of course, critics had many complaints against the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad and, most recently, the Apple Watch, none of which affected the products' stunning popularity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fans appear to be singing a different tune about Apple Music - many were won over by the service in a matter of days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple's new Beats 1 radio service was a popular topic on Twitter over the holiday weekend, according to Fortune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Most tech-savvy consumers already stream music, but is there enough buzz around Apple Music to get them to make the switch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Several critics likened the new service to to Ping, an Apple social networking feature launched back in 2010 that aimed to let artists to connect with fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ping tanked due to its partnership with Facebook- the social media network pulled support just before Ping's debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple moved forward on Ping without Facebook and the feature never quite panned out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Unlike Ping, Apple Music is completely owned by Apple and incorporates Beats technology, which it acquired in 2014 for $3 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The service also uses Apple's in-house iTunes features and iCloud services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But is it better than Spotify?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Critics noted that the user experience is a bit overwhelming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It can be a challenge to figure out how to save songs offline or a disappointment to find that you can't follow friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Variety's critic pointed out that the app itself has too much going on within it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Users can access their own local music files, the subscription catalog, personal recommendations and the existing iTunes download store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Also included in the app is a section for home movies and a section for movie rentals and purchases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On top of that is access to audio books, ringtones and iOS apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On the plus side, Apple Music, like Spotify, has about 30 million songs users can access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Apple has a unique visual setup system that helps the service curate music for the user and it's also very easy to launch if the user is already on an iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The "For You" section is winning over fans because of its targeted recommendation features, which appear to go beyond what Spotify can do, according to Business Insider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The radio feature, with curated lists from popular DJs and artists, is also winning rave reviews from users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Have a hard time getting up in the morning?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Apple Music will let you stream any song as your alarm to help you get out of bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Siri can also act as your personal music curator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Just by asking, Siri can select songs similar to the one you are listening to, or she can create a playlist from a particular year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Users can also assign photos to playlists to quickly identify a list visually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>None of these features are game changers, but they are nice little perks on top of the regular streaming service.</td></tr>
