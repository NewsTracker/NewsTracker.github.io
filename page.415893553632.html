<h3>Indonesian court to decide on Bali Nine execution appeal on April 6</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian court hearing the appeals of two Australian death row convicts will announce a verdict on April 6, one of the judges determining the case said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are among a group of 10 prisoners, mostly foreigners, facing imminent execution for drug offences after President Joko Widodo rejected their pleas for clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Both sides have been given ample opportunity to present evidence and testimony," Judge Ujang Abdullah told the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The (panel of three) judges will decide on the case after studying the evidence submitted. The court is adjourned until Monday April 6 when the judges will read out the verdict (in both cases)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Australian government has pled repeatedly with Indonesia to spare the lives of Sukumaran and Chan, but Widodo has refused to budge, ramping up diplomatic tensions between the neighbors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sukumaran and Chan were convicted in 2005 of being the ringleaders in a plot by a group called the Bali Nine to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At least four other death row inmates have appealed against their sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Indonesia's attorney general has said all 10 prisoners will face the firing squad together but has yet to set a date for the executions.</td></tr>
