<h3>Cincinnati's Mick Cronin cleared to resume coaching (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 43-year-old wasn't permitted to coach games or practices after the problem was detected in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Assistant Larry Davis took over and led the Bearcats to the NCAA Tournament, where they lost to Kentucky in their second game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cronin had more tests recently that found the problem has been resolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The problem - known as arterial dissection - was treated with medication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cronin will have no restrictions as a coach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''What happened to me is a very low-percentage thing,'' Cronin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''It's not the result of the coach yelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And I'm cleared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>I say that because my artery is healed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Cronin came down with the flu in December and started having headaches that didn't go away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tests found the abnormality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Davis took over for a 68-47 loss to VCU on Dec. 20, shortly after the team learned that Cronin would be out for the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Bearcats went 23-11 overall, including 13-5 in the American Athletic Conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They beat Purdue 66-65 in overtime in their opening game at the NCAA Tournament, then lost to Kentucky 64-51, staying with the unbeaten Wildcats for most of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''I'm really proud of the team and what they accomplished while I was going through what I was going through,'' Cronin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Cronin had tests last week that indicated the blood vessel had healed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He spoke with his doctor on Monday morning before a news conference announcing his return to full duties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He had to keep his blood pressure down while the problem was treated, which meant no coaching during practice or games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He watched their games from home, which was the most difficult part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''It was easy when we won, hard when we lost,'' Cronin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''Just the feeling of inadequacy that you can't help - that's by far the hardest part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Cronin's doctors had told him there was a good chance the problem would be healed by March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He appreciates his job a little more after being limited for the last three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''It's a life-changing experience,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''To be honest, you're just more heightened to everything around you, to smelling the roses or smelling the coffee, your appreciation of losing a game and being miserable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''As bad as that sounds, part of me just wanted to be there and be miserable with my staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>I want to be miserable with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Bearcats return 10 of their top 12 players next season, including all five starters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Cronin said doctors are unsure why he developed the problem, but they don't think it will return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He'll get check-ups periodically to make sure the blood vessel is fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''Fortunately now, it's over for me,'' Cronin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Two schools have contacted Davis about open head coaching jobs, impressed with how he handled the team during Cronin's absence.</td></tr>
