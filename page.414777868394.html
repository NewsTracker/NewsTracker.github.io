<h3>Islamic State release video showing beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 21 men, all migrant workers hailing from impoverished areas of central Egypt, were kidnapped between late December and early January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fourteen came for the same village, Al-Our.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And it was also announced on Saturday that a second group of 21 Egyptians had been kidnapped in Libya - this time from Misrata.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was not clear why Isil had seized two groups of 21 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Isil claims to have established affiliate groups in three different areas of Libya, a common destination for Egyptian Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The story of Isil's Egyptian hostages is entwined with those of the region's soured revolutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They left Egypt, their families say, for a better life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Four years after the overthrow of long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak, the country's battle-scarred economy offered them little work, and Christian churches and shops in their governorate, Minya, had faced a series of high-profile sectarian attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The journey out of poverty to Libya is one that many have made over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Every year, thousands of Egyptians are lured by the prospect of salaries up to seven times greater than the paltry sums they can command at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi reacted to the killings by saying Egypt reserved the right to respond in a "suitable way and time&#x201d; and would enforce a strict travel ban on travel to Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Sisi's government has faced heavy criticism from the families of the hostages, who say they have seen no concrete attempts to resolve the situation.</td></tr>
