<h3>Syrian Kurds push deeper into Islamic State stronghold</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BEIRUT The Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said it began an advance towards an Islamic State-held town at the Turkish border on Saturday, thrusting deeper into the jihadists' stronghold of Raqqa province in a campaign backed by U.S.-led air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Redur Xelil, the YPG spokesman, told Reuters the YPG and smaller Syrian Arab rebel groups fighting alongside it had begun the move towards Tel Abyad after encircling the Islamic State-held town of Suluk 20 km (12 miles) to the southeast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The advance raises the prospect of a battle at the Turkish border between the well-organized YPG militia and Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tel Abyad is important to Islamic State as the nearest border town to its de facto capital of Raqqa city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fighting near the border has already forced more than 13,000 people to cross into Turkey from Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Some 1,500 more are waiting to cross.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Turkish soldiers sprayed water and fired into the air when some of them approached the border fence on Saturday, a security source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The move towards Tel Abyad from the east began today after the completion of the Suluk blockade," Xelil said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Many of the Daesh militants have fled (Suluk), apart from a group of suicide attackers inside the town and the booby traps, so we are very cautious about entering the town center," he added via Skype.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Daesh is an Arabic name for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organization that tracks the war, said the YPG fighters were now half-way between Suluk and Tel Abyad, situated across the border from the Turkish town of Akcakle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For the YPG, seizing Tel Abyad would help them link up Kurdish-controlled areas in Hasaka province and Kobani.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The expansion of Kurdish influence in Syria near the border with Turkey is a concern for Ankara, which has long been worried about separatism among its own Kurdish population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Turkish authorities have closed Akcakale to vehicles and it has been months since they allowed anyone to cross from Tel Abyad into Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, Turkey still allows people with a valid passport to cross into Syria from Akcakle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Turkish military has dug trenches in the border area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>With the help of U.S.-led air strikes, the YPG fended off an Islamic State attack on the border town of Kobani, or Ayn al-Arab, in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Since then, the YPG has emerged as the most significant partner on the ground in Syria for the U.S.-led alliance that is trying to roll back Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Washington has ruled out the idea of partnering with President Bashar al-Assad, who last month lost the city of Palmyra in central Syria to Islamic State -- the first time the jihadists seized a city directly from government control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday accused the West of bombing Arabs and Turkmens in Syria while supporting Kurdish "terrorist" groups he said were filling the void left behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Xelil said: "The help of the alliance forces has been very effective and accurate in its target selection."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The YPG is affiliated to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has fought a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The PKK is considered a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and European Union.</td></tr>
