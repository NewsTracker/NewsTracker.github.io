<h3>Ukraine says radiation levels not affected by Chernobyl fire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian authorities say there has been no change in background radiation levels in the capital as a result of fires in woodlands in the exclusion zone around the destroyed Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The emergency services agency said in a statement Wednesday that isotope levels in surface soil and water are within standard levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kiev, the capital, lies less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) downriver from the zone around Chernobyl, which was heavily contaminated by radiation from the 1986 reactor explosion and fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A 30-kilometer (18.6-mile) zone around the plant is off-limits to most people except for workers constructing a new shelter to cover the destroyed reactor's building, and to visitors on short trips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities said Tuesday evening's fire swept through 400 hectares (1.5 square miles) of woodland.</td></tr>
