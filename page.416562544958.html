<h3>Australia wants corruption claims against judges investigated before Bali Nine pair executed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australia wants corruption allegations against Indonesian judges investigated before their death sentences against two Australian drug traffickers are carried out, the foreign minister said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Australians, Myuran Sukumaran, 33, and Andrew Chan, 31, are among nine drug traffickers who were given 72-hour notices over the weekend that they will be executed by a firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Indonesian authorities say that the Australians have exhausted all avenues of appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Foreign Minister Julie Bishop argued that the men should not be executed while they have an unresolved case before Indonesia's Constitutional Court and while Indonesia's Judicial Commission investigates claims of corruption in the pair's original trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to Australia's Fairfax Media, Sukumaran and Chan's original Indonesian lawyer, Muhammad Rifan, said the trial judges originally asked for a 1 million rupiah ($100,000) bribe to pass sentences of less than 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rifan alleged that the deal fell through after the judges later said that they had been ordered by senior legal and government figures to impose the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rifan said the judges then "started asking for a lot more money" to provide a lesser sentence, but the pair did not have any more money, Fairfax Media reported Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rifan could not be immediately contacted for comment Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Indonesian Attorney General Muhammad Prasetyo said the bribery case had no bearing on the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It does not affect the executions because all their (Sukumaran's and Chan's) rights have been fulfilled," Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The two were sentenced to death in February 2006 for leading an Australian smuggling group dubbed the Bali Nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They were arrested in 2005 after a tip-off from Australian police while trying to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Sydney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The rest were sentenced to prison terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sukumaran and Chan have provided sworn statements to the Judicial Commission, which safeguards the probity of judges, Fairfax Media reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Foreign Minister Bishop said she contacted her Indonesian counterpart, Retno Marsudi, on Sunday night in a bid to prevent the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She said the Australians should not be killed while two legal cases were outstanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"There have been some allegations made in relation to the trial and I said that Australia, indeed the international community, would expect those legal processes to be concluded before any other action was taken," Bishop told reporters in Sydney about her conversation with Marsudi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I would anticipate that both proceedings - the Constitutional Court proceedings and the Judicial Commission - would require to hear evidence. I would anticipate that they would need to hear evidence from Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran, and therefore, my request that these proceedings be allowed to continue and that there be a stay of execution," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Bishop and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott continued to lobby Indonesia on Monday, saying it was not too late for Indonesia to have a change of heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Authorities have asked the two Australians, four Nigerian men, a Filipino woman, and one man each from Brazil and Indonesia for their last wish and given them a 72-hour notice of their executions, a spokesman for the Indonesian attorney general, Tony Spontana, said Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Prasetyo said Monday that another convict, Frenchman Serge Atlaoui, would not be executed with the others because he still has an outstanding legal complaint over the rejection of his clemency appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Prasetyo said Atlaoui would later face a firing squad alone if his complaint is turned down by the Administrative Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Similar appeals by Sukumaran and Chan were rejected by the Administrative Court and the High Administrative Court, with both ruling that clemency is the prerogative of the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The 72-hour notice indicates that executions by firing squad in Besi prison on Nusakambangan Island will be carried out at the earliest on Wednesday.</td></tr>
