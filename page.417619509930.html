<h3>Obama administration criticizes Egypt in report to Congress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration has sent Congress a report that harshly criticizes the Egyptian government for restricting free speech, arresting political opponents and undermining democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Even so, the report also recommends the U.S. continue sending it $1.3 billion in mostly military aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report, quietly submitted to lawmakers last month, said that while Egypt has implemented some democratic reforms, "the overall trajectory of rights and democracy has been negative."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The report, which the administration was required to send to Congress, says human rights and civil activists have reported a "steadily shrinking space for political dissent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It also says that, except in rare instances, police and security forces have not been held accountable for alleged human rights violations.</td></tr>
