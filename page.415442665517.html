<h3>UN head urges better help, safeguards for climate-related disasters as cyclone slams Vanuatu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy. I do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu," Vanuatu's president, Baldwin Lonsdale, told the U.N. World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in the northeastern Japanese city of Sendai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the conference earlier he met with Lonsdale to express condolences and solidarity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The U.N. said it was prepared to deploy emergency response teams to the islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Preventing disaster is "everybody's business," Ban said, urging better help and more safeguards for the world's poorest and weakest people as the threat from climate-related disasters grows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pacific island leaders are speaking out at the conference about their concerns, as sea levels rise and extreme storms intensify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Vanuatu's 260,000 people living on 83 islands are among the most at risk, from earthquakes and tsunamis as well as cyclones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Emmanuel Mori, president of the Federated States of Micronesia, noted that the dispersed communities and tiny land areas of many islands put such countries at a big disadvantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The world must act and act fast," Mori said, appealing for more effective measures to curb carbon emissions seen as causing climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ban said the best tribute to victims of disaster would be to ensure the gathering in Japan forges a strong framework for preventing and coping with catastrophes like the triple whammy of massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant meltdowns that hit northeastern Japan's coastline, including Sendai, four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More than 18,500 people died or were left missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"What we are discussing here is very real for millions around the world. We must keep their needs in sharp focus during the negotiations on this agreement," Ban said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Though low and middle income countries suffer nine out of 10 disaster-related deaths, and need special attention, "But disaster risk is in everybody's interest - and it is everybody's business."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Organizers of the conference have indicated that while all may agree on the need to prevent and cope with disasters, opinions differ on how to best do that and measure the results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One of the biggest obstacles is the tendency to put off spending on disaster prevention, while disasters cost the world over $300 billion a year on average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We can watch that number grow as more people suffer. Or we can dramatically lower that figure and invest the savings in development," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Spending $6 billion a year on prevention could help save some $360 billion by 2030.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Disaster risk reduction is a front-line defense against the impacts of climate change. It is a smart investment for business and a wise investment in saving lives," he said.</td></tr>

<h3>This couple not wedded to marriage</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A marriage license isn't necessary to travel the globe, which they've been doing for 30 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In April, the El Cajon residents will celebrate their three decades together by going on a two-week cruise to Hawaii.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We were both divorced," Pope said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Having grown children, we don't see the need to be married. We are both 78 years old and looking forward to many, many more happy years."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pope and Dye met at a now-defunct Mission Valley country-music bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Their subsequent dates went in fast succession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Soon, Pope popped a question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I had lived in San Francisco for four years and told Gerry I was going back for a week's vacation and asked if she wanted to go along," Pope said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"She jumped at the suggestion. During the flight, we discussed the fact that we would be together, 24/7, and that we would know by the end of the trip if this relationship would be going anywhere or if we'd end it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Pope has two daughters in Houston, four grandchildren and eight great grandchildren; Dye has two sons in Alabama and a daughter in Dallas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Pope and Dye spent 10 years in Marietta, Ga., to be closer to her two now college-age grandchildren.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The couple, both previously residents of El Cajon, returned here in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The families approve of their unmarried relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"My kids think it's fabulous," Dye said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Longtime friend Ellie Day belongs to the same church as Dye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Both are in the Red Hat Society, a social organization of women who meet for tea, wearing red hats and purple dresses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She has frequently traveled with Dye and Pope.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's comical when they can be on the verge of arguing, but then they work it out," Day said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"They are in tune with one another. They discuss a lot, even politics. They communicate well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But it wasn't completely smooth sailing at first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Shortly after Pope and Dye became a couple, they decided Dye could benefit from assertiveness training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Gerry was subservient in her marriage. She kept things peaceful," said Pope, who retired at age 60.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He was a civilian product controller, after serving 27 years in the Navy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He said Dye would never offer her opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Jim told me: 'I'm aggressive, and I'll end up chewing you up," Dye recalled, with a chuckle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"He was right."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Pope said the classes succeeded and called Dye "a fast learner."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The couple's past travel destinations include Russia, China, Europe and Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Despite trucks stuck in the mud and troublesome baboons, the safari in Kenya was special to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Other adventures also stand out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"My favorite was - well, actually anywhere in Europe," said Dye, a retired human resources manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Our first trip to Europe was an El Cajon sister-city tour. We visited Lichtenstein, Austria, Germany and Northern Italy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Pope elaborated: "We started in our German sister city, Sulzfeld. We had dinner in a castle one night. Then we took a motor-coach tour to these other areas.</td></tr>
