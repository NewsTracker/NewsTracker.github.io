<h3>Kerry to Meet Russia's Putin Amid Ukraine, Syria Tensions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin with an eye on easing badly strained relations over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kerry laid a wreath at a World War II memorial in the Black Sea resort city Tuesday before holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Later, he was to meet Putin on the brief visit, his first to Russia since May 2013 and the advent of the Ukraine crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The top U.S. diplomat plans to test Putin's willingness to push pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine to comply with an increasingly fragile ceasefire agreement, according to U.S. officials traveling with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kerry will also seek to gauge the status of Russia's support for embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose forces have been losing ground to rebels, and press Moscow to support a political transition that could end that war, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In addition, Kerry will make the case to Putin that Russia should not proceed with its planned transfer of an advanced air defense system to Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kerry's trip comes at a time when relations between Washington and Moscow have plummeted to post-Cold War lows amid the disagreements over Ukraine and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a sign of the considerable strains, the Kremlin said Monday that the Putin meeting was not confirmed, although U.S. officials insisted it was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A senior State Department official brushed aside the non-confirmation of the meeting from the Russian side, saying tersely, "We usually don't go to Sochi to see Foreign Minister Lavrov."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Tuesday morning, the Kremlin finally confirmed that Putin will meet with Kerry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Putin's spokesman welcomed Kerry's decision to travel to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We have repeatedly stated at various levels and the president has said that Russia never initiated the freeze in relations and we are always open for displays of political will for a broader dialogue," Dmitry Peskov told journalists in Sochi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Russia's Foreign Ministry had previewed the talks by blaming Washington for the breakdown in relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Obama administration chose the path of scaling back bilateral relations, proclaimed a course of isolating Russia on the international arena and demanded that those states that traditionally follow the lead of Washington support its confrontational steps," it said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ukraine's crisis, it said, "was largely provoked by the United States itself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The rhetoric hardly augured well for a breakthrough on any of the many issues dividing the U.S. and Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nevertheless, both sides stressed the importance of trying to work through some of the rancor that buried President Barack Obama's first-term effort to "reset" ties with Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged the "complicated" relationship between the former foes, but insisted they could cooperate on "interests that benefit the citizens of both our countries."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Much hinges on violence decreasing in Ukraine, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Western-backed government in Kiev continues to be embroiled in a sporadic conflict between government and separatist rebel forces in its eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk despite a cease-fire agreement sealed in mid-February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Russia was party to that deal; although the U.S. was not, one State Department official said it is important for Putin "to hear directly from the United States that we are firmly committed to (its) implementation."</td></tr>
