<tr><td>13</td><td>Fifteen years later, in 1975, she was again rebuffed over gender when attempting to join the Marines: "You're too old, you can't see, and you're a woman," the recruiter allegedly told her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>What she was like as first lady: Unlike some previous first ladies, who contented themselves with coordinating social engagements and championing charitable causes from the White House's East Wing, Mrs. Clinton broke tradition and set up shop in the West Wing, intent on reforming the nation's healthcare system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In "Hillaryland," Mrs. Clinton - billed during her husband's campaign a bonus in the two-for-the-price-of-one Clinton administration - was as headstrong as she was passionate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When Health and Human Services Sec.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>Might have wished for a do-over: Defending her speaking fees, Clinton told ABC's Diane Sawyer in June 2014 that she and her husband were "dead broke" when they left the White House, $12 million in debt and struggling to pay their mortgages.</td></tr>
