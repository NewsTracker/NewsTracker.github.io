<tr><td>3</td><td>Despite signs of improvement in Friday practice at the Malaysian Grand Prix, Renault Sport F1 managing director Cyril Abiteboul did not pull any punches when asked at a news conference about the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I can confirm that we are looking at a lot of options, including getting out of Formula One," the Frenchman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We think we are a credible player in the sport but you need to think about what else we need to do on top of what we already are. But right now, the focus remains on the engine."</td></tr>
