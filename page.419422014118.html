<h3>In rare move, New Mexico police officers to stand trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Defense attorney Luis Robles, left, talks to former Albuquerque detective Keith Sandy, center, and Albuquerque officer Dominique Perez, right, during a preliminary hearing in Albuquerque, N.M. on Monday, Aug. 17, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A judge is listening to testimony and will decide if Sandy and Perez should stand trial for the fatal shooting of a homeless man in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A former and a current New Mexico police officer charged with murder sat motionless after a judge announced they would have to face a jury trial for the on-duty shooting of a homeless man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officer Dominique Perez and former Detective Keith Sandy were ordered Tuesday to stand trial for the 2014 killing of 38-year-old James Boyd, whose shooting in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains was caught on video and sparked national outrage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's unusual for a judge to order police officers to stand trial for murder - even as the country debates use of force by police and sees protests in far-flung places over shootings by officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Only seven police officers around the country have faced murder charges for on-duty incidents since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One was convicted of manslaughter and assault after a second-degree murder count was dropped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The rest are still in court proceedings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In New Mexico, Pro Tem Judge Neil Candelaria ruled after a nearly two-week preliminary hearing that there was probable cause for Perez and Sandy to face trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Unlike secret grand jury proceedings after police shootings in New York and Ferguson, Missouri, the hearing in Albuquerque was open to the public and streamed online by television media outlets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Candelaria's decision was met with silence in his packed courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some supporters of Perez and Sandy held their hands over their mouths in disbelief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There have been more than 40 shootings by Albuquerque police since 2010 and only Perez and Sandy have been ordered to stand trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After the ruling, defense lawyer Sam Bregman asked Candelaria what standard he used to justify probable cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Candelaria replied, "What a reasonable police officer in that situation would do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Defense lawyers did not immediately comment after the ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But in a radio interview, Bregman said the decision meant Albuquerque police have the toughest job in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Special Prosecutor Randi McGinn said during the hearing that Perez and Sandy came to the scene with the intent of attacking Boyd during a "paramilitary response" and created the danger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"He was shot in the back and in the side," McGinn said during her closing argument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"That shows that he was not a threat when they shot him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>McGinn pointed out that Sandy in a recording vowed that he was going shoot the "lunatic" before going into the foothills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Other officers testified that police at the scene knew Boyd was mentally ill, but it was unclear if Sandy and Perez knew he was schizophrenic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Video of the 2014 shooting taken with an officer's helmet camera showed Boyd gathering his belongs and appearing to surrender after an hours-long standoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Police then detonated a flash bomb near Boyd, who dropped his bag and pulled two knives before Perez and Sandy shot him as he fell to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Authorities had been called to the scene over a report of an illegal camper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Boyd died at a hospital after his arm was amputated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Defense lawyers said Boyd had threatened officers with two knives and Perez and Sandy had no choice about opening fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The lawyers said the officers were following their training and protecting their colleagues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The killing of Boyd generated angry protests in Albuquerque before the nation watched similar scenes unfold in Ferguson after a white police officer killed an unarmed 18-year-old black man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Shortly after the killing of Boyd, Justice Department officials released a harsh report faulting Albuquerque police for excessive force, especially against suspects suffering for mental illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The city and the Justice Department later reached an agreement to overhaul policies involving use of force and to appoint a federal monitor to oversee reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In a statement, Albuquerque Police Chief Gorden Eden said he couldn't comment on the judge's decision since he expected to be a witness at the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"As this case is moving though our judicial system, my focus is on continually moving the Albuquerque Police Department forward," Eden said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Defense attorney Sam Bregman, left, questions Albuquerque K-9 officer Scott Weimerskirch while on a 4-foot platform in Albuquerque to illustrate on Monday, Aug. 17, 2015, how a knife-wielding homeless man on a hill posed a threat to officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A judge heard testimony Monday and will decide if former Albuquerque detective Keith Sandy and Albuquerque officer Dominique Perez should stand trial for the fatal shooting of James Boyd in 2014.</td></tr>
