<h3>Islamic State threatens to seize Syrian border town from other rebels</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Beirut: Islamic State militants are reported to be closing in on a strategic border town in north-western Syria's Aleppo province, near the Turkish frontier, after routing rival rebel groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attack appeared to signal another territorial gain for the breakaway al-Qaeda faction, which has recently seized the central Syrian city of Palmyra and the western Iraqi city of Ramadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Pro-opposition activists hostile to IS said on Sunday that the militants in their latest thrust had overrun the village of Soran, east of the Syrian border town of Azaz, and nearby areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>IS forces were widely expected to assault Azaz, which has been in the hands of insurgents hostile to Islamic State for more than a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The town is a strategic prize because of its proximity to the giant Bab al-Salam border crossing into Turkey, a major transit point for goods and supplies entering northern Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Turkey, which shares a more than 800-kilometre border with Syria, is a vital logistics and resupply hub for a broad range of armed Syrian opposition groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Since Syria's conflict began in 2011, rebel factions in control of border posts have been positioned both to supply their forces expeditiously and to collect fees from truckers and others entering Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Fierce resistance from Kurdish-led forces aided by US bombing early this year helped thwart Islamic State's bid to seize the Syrian border town of Kobane, about 140 kilometres north-east of Azaz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kurdish and allied forces are also reported to be fighting to evict IS from the crucial Tal Abyad border crossing, about 65 kilometres south-east of Kobane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Sunday, the IS advance toward Azaz triggered widespread alarm among rival rebel factions on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Aleppo Revolutionaries Union, a pro-opposition body hostile to Islamic State, issued a statement calling on all its allies to confront the militant group after "its vicious attack".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The rebels arrayed against Islamic State in north-western Syria include Islamist and Western-backed factions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Prominent among them are the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham - both Islamist groups that are fierce rivals of IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Many predicted that the IS thrust would push back opposition plans for a renewed offensive against government-held areas in the city of Aleppo, which has long been divided between opposition and loyalist forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"All the preparation work for the liberation of Aleppo has now been sabotaged by the attack," an Ahrar al-Sham spokesman who goes by the name Abu Yusuf al-Muhajer said via Skype from Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>IS appears to be seeking to recapture territory that it lost early last year, when it was expelled from Azaz and much of Aleppo province in fighting.</td></tr>
