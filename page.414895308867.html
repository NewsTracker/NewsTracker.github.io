<h3>WHO approves 15-minute Ebola test</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The test, developed by Corgenix Medical Corp, is less accurate than the standard PCR test but is easy to perform, does not require electricity, and can give results within 15 minutes, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Procurement and roll-out of the test kits will not begin immediately because the company is still working out costing and needs a week or two more to finish administrative procedures with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he said.</td></tr>
