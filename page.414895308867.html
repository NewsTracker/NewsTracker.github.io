<h3>WHO approves 15-minute Ebola test</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The test, developed by Corgenix Medical Corp, is less accurate than the standard PCR test but is easy to perform, does not require electricity, and can give results within 15 minutes, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Procurement and roll-out of the test kits will not begin immediately because the company is still working out costing and needs a week or two more to finish administrative procedures with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he said.</td></tr>

<h3>Indonesia says executions of Australians delayed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine heroin trafficking group, "will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons," without elaborating further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Indonesian authorities had already confirmed that Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, would be among the next group of prisoners on death row to be executed, despite repeated appeals from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for their lives to be spared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The two Australians were due to be transferred this week from Bali to a high-security prison on Nusakambangan island ahead of execution, but that was delayed after appeals from Canberra that the men be granted more time with their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Indonesian authorities also cited logistical difficulties involving capacity at Nusakambangan - the notorious island prison where five inmates were executed last month - as a reason for the delay.</td></tr>
