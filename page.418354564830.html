<h3>Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton support bankruptcy rights for Puerto Rico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Both 2016 presidential candidates support giving Puerto Rico the same legal bankruptcy rights that states have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Puerto Rico's governor has been lobbying hard for that right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There's a bill in Congress to give Puerto Rico what it wants, but it has no co-sponsors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That's why Bush and Clinton's backing could be key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I think that Puerto Rico ought to be treated as other states are treated as it relates to restructuring," Bush said during a visit to the island in late April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Other Republican candidates have largely stayed silent on the issue thus far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Tuesday, Clinton jumped on board as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Congress should provide Puerto Rico the same authority that states already have to enable severely distressed government entities, including municipalities and public corporations, to restructure their debts," she said in a statement on her campaign website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley has been a vocal supporter as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>What it means: To be clear, no state can file for bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the 50 states do have the right to allow municipalities -- cities, towns and other local government entities -- within their states to file for bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Puerto Rican municipalities want to be able to file for what is known as Chapter 9 bankruptcy like Detroit and Vallejo, California did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The benefit of bankruptcy is that is allows a broke government to shed some of its debt -- if a judge approve a municipality's game plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Will Congress act?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The bill in Congress would give Puerto Rico the same rights that states have under Chapter 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>So far, the bill's only supporter in Congress is Puerto Rico's representative, who get to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It might seem like a small issue in Washington, but it's a big issue for financial markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Puerto Rico has a tiny population -- about the size of Connecticut -- but it has a debt the size of a big state like New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Over 20% of U.S. bond funds hold Puerto Rican debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The island doesn't have enough money to pay back its creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Some have even taken to calling it "America's Greece."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla says Puerto Rico is in a "death spiral."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A lot of the trouble stems from Puerto Rico's power company, known as PREPA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It alone has $9 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It would be a game changer if PREPA could declare bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Related: Who owns Puerto Rico's debt?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Why bankruptcy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Chapter 9 is really the only way to impose some sort of restructuring on all the bondholders," says David Tawil, a lawyer and president of Maglan Capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Bond holders don't want Puerto Rico to get that because it opens the possibility that they would be forced to take a loss on their bond investment if a bankruptcy judge sides with the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But the proposal has little currency in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"The bill that is in Congress has no co-sponsors and no support in Congress, although it does have a fair amount of support among bankruptcy experts," says Juliet Moringiello, a professor at Widener University School of Law and a former scholar of the American Bankruptcy Institute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Moringiello notes that Chapter 9 bankruptcy is rare, although the majority of filings have been public hospitals and utilities like PREPA, not cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Where the candidates stand: Jeb Bush has been a vocal supporter of statehood for Puerto Rico -- if the island's citizens want that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I think statehood is the best path, personally," Bush said in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Since then, he has clarified that he thinks the island needs to make a number of changes to deal with its debt beyond just declaring bankruptcy, including reducing some benefits for workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>On the Democratic side, O'Malley was an early supporter of Puerto Rico getting Chapter 9 bankruptcy rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Senator Bernie Sanders has voiced his support for Greece, but has yet to say much on Puerto Rico.</td></tr>
