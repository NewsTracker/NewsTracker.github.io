<h3>After Wizards get sweep, Pierce takes jabs at Raptors, Drake (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) -- At age 37, Paul Pierce is having a grand ol' time on this playoff run with the Washington Wizards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>So before turning his attention to whoever his team's second-round Eastern Conference opponent will be in a week or more - either No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1 seed Atlanta or No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>8 Brooklyn - Pierce wanted to relish Washington's sweep of the Toronto Raptors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>So within a couple of hours after the Wizards completed the franchise's first 4-0 win in a best-of-seven series by beating Toronto 125-94 on Sunday night, Pierce's Twitter and Facebook accounts were in full troll mode, replete with doctored photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One showed an image of Pierce sitting on the iconic ''Game of Thrones'' iron-sword seat, under the headline ''King in the North,'' a play off the Raptors' ''We the North'' slogan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Another depicted Drake, the Canadian rapper who is the Raptors' ''Global Brand Ambassador,'' ripping open a shirt to reveal Pierce's No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Aside from Pierce's contributions on the court - such as 14 points and four of Washington's club postseason-record 15 3-pointers on Sunday - he is putting in work off it, mentoring younger teammates such as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Not to mention doing what he can to get into foes' heads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''Playoffs is a different game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The intensity goes up, more is on the line, and that's where you see the stars become superstars,'' Pierce said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pierce has been through it all, playing in 152 career playoff games and winning an NBA championship ring with the 2008 Boston Celtics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was signed last offseason when the Wizards lost Trevor Ariza to free agency, and after having a lighter workload during the regular season, Pierce has given the Wizards the sort of clutch 3-point shooting and leadership they needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A year ago, Wall and Beal made their postseason debuts, eliminating the Chicago Bulls in the first round before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''The biggest thing now (is) I don't want that feeling again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I don't want to have that same feeling of going home, knowing that we should be advancing,'' Beal, a third-year shooting guard, said after scoring a game-high 23 points Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He also was not shy about acknowledging the Wizards' aspirations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''Winning this series really gives us confidence, but at the same time, we need to stay humble, because it's not over,'' Beal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We have another tough series up next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And then another one after that, if we advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And another one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Heady talk for someone who plays on a team that went more than three decades without topping 45 wins, until getting 46 this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And by eliminating No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>4 seed Toronto, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>5 Washington has made it to the conference semifinals in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1978 and 1979, when - still known as the Bullets - the team won a title, then reached the NBA Finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Atlanta leads Brooklyn 2-1, with Game 4 of that series Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Now comes some time off for the Wizards, a chance for Pierce to get a breather, for Wall to let his dinged-up right shoulder to heal, for Beal to do the same with his banged-up knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''It's great to get this out of the way and get a rest while the other guys are playing,'' said Wall, who averaged 17.3 points and 12.3 assists against Toronto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Going into the first round, Pierce drew attention for his remarks about the Raptors' lack of the ''It'' factor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He's pretty sure others' perception of the Wizards is changing.</td></tr>
