<h3>German FM: Russia's Return to G-8 Depends on Ukraine Deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Germany's foreign minister said Monday that Russia's return to the top diplomatic table depends on the success of a peace initiative for Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Russia lost its membership in the Group of Eight major economies last year over its backing for separatists fighting against the government in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The comment by Frank-Walter Steinmeier came hours before a meeting with his counterparts from Russia, Ukraine and France aimed at implementing deals struck in the Belarusian capital Minsk in February and September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Steinmeier dismissed suggestions that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be invited to attend the G-7 meeting hosted by Germany in June, but said Moscow shouldn't be isolated indefinitely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The path from G-7 to G-8 will surely lead via Ukraine and the issue of the implementation of the Minsk Agreement," he said during a visit to Barcelona, Spain, according to remarks released by his office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Steinmeier said Monday's talks, which he predicted would be lengthy, would focus on laying the groundwork for a local election in the rebel-occupied areas; restarting the process of exchanging prisoners of war; and improving the dire economic situation in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shortly before the meeting's start, Steinmeier expressed concern about a flare-up in fighting in Ukraine over the past couple of days.</td></tr>
