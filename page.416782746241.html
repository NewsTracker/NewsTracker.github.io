<h3>Nigerian Troops Save 25 More Kids, Women From Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nigerian troops rescued 25 more children and women from Boko Haram early Wednesday as the soldiers destroyed seven more of the extremists' camps in a northeastern forest stronghold, the army spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Many militants were killed in "a fierce encounter" that cost the life of one soldier and wounded five, Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sani Usman said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The military has reported saving about 700 children and women in recent days as soldiers supported by air raids have advanced further into the last hideouts of Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It is unclear if those rescued include the schoolgirls kidnapped a year ago from a boarding school in Chibok town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dozens escaped but 219 remain missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A 3-month-old multinational offensive has driven Boko Haram from towns where it had declared an Islamic caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The militants have retreated into the vast Sambisa Forest, where they have planted land mines to impede attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our troops are unrelenting in their determined efforts of vanquishing Boko Haram terrorists wherever they are," Usman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Saturday, the first group of 275 rescued - about 60 women and the rest children - arrived under military escort to the safety of a refugee camp in the eastern city of Yola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They brought news that some women have died in the rescue missions: Boko Haram militants stoned about 10 women to death for refusing to flee with them, several were accidentally crushed by an armored personnel carrier, and three died when they triggered a land mine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There were some tearful family reunions at the refugee camp this week, the BBC reported in a video showing a teen-age girl being hugged by a woman relative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Most do not know if their husbands and children still are alive or were killed in the attacks when Boko Haram captured them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They say the insurgents are running out of ammunition, fuel and food - as can be seen by the sad state of some critically malnourished children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One 3-year-old died in a Yola hospital just days after being freed, the BBC reported.</td></tr>
