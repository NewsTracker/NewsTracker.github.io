<h3>Fraternity in racist video has roots in antebellum South</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The fraternity founded at the University of Alabama held its Southern heritage close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We came up from Dixie land," says a ditty from an old SAE songbook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But nearly 160 years later, another song - this one chanted by members of the frat's University of Oklahoma chapter and containing racial slurs and lynching references - hearkens back to the land of cotton and puts a new spotlight on the group's history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>SAE officials insist the chant that resulted in suspension of the chapter is neither a sanctioned song nor is it taught to fraternity members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If there are any other chapters that use the song, "we need to address that with those chapters and stop it immediately to stamp out this type of behavior," SAE spokesman Brandon Weghorst said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The lyrics "are so hateful and spiteful that it's embarrassing to think that Sigma Alpha Epsilon members would even know the chant or how it goes, if they've heard it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The fraternity was also investigating reports of other SAE incidents that may have been tainted with racism, Weghorst said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>SAE began on the Tuscaloosa campus on March 9, 1856, a few months after Noble Leslie DeVotie outlined his vision to a close circle of friends during a stroll along the banks of the Black Warrior River.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The founders envisioned the members sharing a lifelong bond, according to a 1916 history of the fraternity by William C. Levere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"So it came about that in the late hours of a stormy night, the friends met in the old southern mansion and by the flicker of dripping candles organized Sigma Alpha Epsilon," Levere wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More chapters were soon launched in Tennessee, North Carolina and Washington, D.C., at what is now George Washington University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But the founders were not interested in a national presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>According to Levere, it was their intention "to confine the fraternity to the southern states."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When a North Carolina chapter member raised the topic of a "Northern Extension," charter member Thomas Chappell Cook - who later served as a surgeon in the Confederate army - responded that "the constant agitation of the slavery question was a barrier to northern chapters, as it would preclude the possibility of harmony."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Civil War soon put an end to the internal debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Because of the fighting, the fraternity's charter was surrendered in 1861.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Washington City Rho chapter was the only one to emerge from the war intact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>SAE would not return to its birthplace until 1886, after the Reconstruction-era ban on "secret societies" was relaxed and the school's trustees, in Levere's words, repealed "obnoxious anti-fraternity laws."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the meantime, the fraternity had granted its first Northern charter in 1883 to, of all schools, Pennsylvania College - the abolitionist institution now known as Gettysburg College.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The editors of the New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture call SAE "the first Greek-letter society founded in Dixie to take permanent root."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In December 1930, the fraternity dedicated its international headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Evanston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But, like other fraternities North and South, SAE had not yet embraced racial diversity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In his 2013 book, "The People's Advocate," attorney Daniel P. Sheehan claims credit for championing the bid of Tommy Williamson, who he wrote was the first black man to receive a nomination for membership in SAE.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Sheehan, who said he was social chairman of SAE's Harvard chapter in 1966, said Williamson's was the first name he called when it was time to vote for new members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He and Williamson, a defensive lineman on the Crimson football team, both lived at Kirkland House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>On the first ballot, Sheehan said, Williamson received three "blackballs," or negative votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Sheehan then announced he would blackball every other nominee until whoever had blocked Williamson "fessed up and gave us their reasons," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It took six more ballots for a member to admit that he was voting against Williamson because he'd heard that the Piedmont, California, native dated white women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sheehan said Williamson's nomination was approved on the seventh ballot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But when Sheehan told him how the vote had gone down, he wrote, Williamson declined the invitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Reached by telephone Tuesday, Williamson, who practices employment law in Washington, D.C., told The Associated Press that he wasn't really interested in joining a fraternity, especially if some members didn't want him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I didn't want to be the sort of obsessive token negro," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Weghorst was unable to say whether Williamson was indeed the first black man formally invited to join a chapter because only within the last couple of years has the organization started to track the ethnicity of people who join, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>SAE has had its share of controversy in more recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>- In 1988, the founding chapter was suspended for violations of the university's drug codes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The suspension was lifted two years later, only to be levied again in 1992 when the chapter failed to meet the goals outlined for reinstatement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Most of the actions taken against SAE in the past have been for infractions of a non-racial nature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But the University of Oklahoma video is not an isolated incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>- In October 2006, the University of Memphis chapter was investigated after a freshman member complained that his brothers made inappropriate remarks to and about his black girlfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Two members were later suspended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>- In February 2013, Washington University in St. Louis suspended its SAE chapter while investigating claims that pledges engaged in racially offensive behavior toward minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>- In December 2014, Clemson University suspended the frat after a gang-themed "Cripmas party" at which white members dressed in T-shirts bearing images of handcuffs and the late rapper Tupac Shakur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Last year, SAE reached what it called "a historic milestone" - becoming the first large national fraternity to eliminate the pledge process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"Instead, we have implemented a holistic education known as the True Gentleman Experience," SAE says on its website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"It provides education throughout a member's collegiate tenure and fosters both personal and professional development."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Associated Press writers Kelly P. Kissel in Little Rock and Teresa Crawford in Chicago also contributed to this story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Allen G. Breed is an AP national writer based in Raleigh, North Carolina.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali nine: Andrew Chan and fiancee reunite on execution island</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cilacap: Andrew Chan and his Indonesian fiancee Febyanti Herewila have been reunited on Nusakambangan as the families of the Bali nine duo stepped up their campaign to convince ordinary Indonesians that the men deserve mercy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Andrew's brother Michael gave up his spot to Febyanti for the tightly controlled visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the first time she has seen her fiance since Tuesday last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chinthu Sukumaran is interviewed by Indonesia's SCTV in Cilacap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Febyanti, also known as Feby, is a fellow pastor who has known Chan since 2012, when she began helping prisoners at Bali's Kerobokan prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A friendship formed, which last year developed into a loving relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last month, soon after hearing his bid for clemency from execution had been rejected by Indonesian president Joko Widodo, Chan proposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Febyanti made a dramatic, predawn dash through police lines to Kerobokan early on Wednesday last week to see Chan before his transfer to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As Febyanti and Michael Chan frantically negotiated with prison officials, she was in tears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The bid to see Chan was futile, and the Bali nine pair left the prison in an armoured personnel carrier 30 minutes later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Andrew was very happy to see some new faces today, especially Feby," Michael Chan told Fairfax Media after catching up with Febyanti and his family post-visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Just to be able to give his extended family hugs, and for them to pass on verbal messages of support to him has been very good and kept him upbeat."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chinthu Sukumaran, meanwhile, gave an interview to the local TV network SCTV, the third the families have given to Indonesian broadcasters in the past fortnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chinthu explained that, as a young man, Sukumaran had cared for his younger siblings when their father was "sick".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"'He was a good brother," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"He looked after my sister and I when my mother was working very hard to support .he cooked for us, he took us to school."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He then outlined the projects Sukumaran had instigated and run in Kerobokan prison, explaining how they had provided skills to Indonesian prisoners to get jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Chinthu also thanked the Indonesian guards and prison officials for supporting his brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While Chinthu said he did not know if his brother was aware drug smuggling carried the death penalty in Indonesia when he committed the crime, he said Sukumaran had helped people get off drugs in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We just ask that he not be executed. There is reason to show mercy in this case."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Indonesians strongly support the death penalty, but the remarkable rehabilitation of the Bali nine duo is not widely known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Even less well known is that the drugs they were trafficking were heading for Australia, a fact that even senior officials seem to be in denial about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Bali governor Made Pastika, a former head of the anti-narcotics police, is a prime example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Asked about the intended destination of the drugs last month, he said: "No we don't know that. The fact is that we arrested them here with the heroin, we don't know, are you sure they are going [there]?".</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Bali nine couriers were arrested at Denpasar airport after purchasing tickets for Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Australian Federal Police, who tipped off Indonesian authorities, made it clear the plot was to bring heroin to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Meanwhile, the head of corrections in Central Java, Ahmad Yuspahruddin, told Fairfax Media, Chan and Sukumaran were not permitted to mix with the general prison population but this will change if the executions are delayed for a lengthy period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sukumaran has not been able to paint yet, but that could change if there is confirmation of a lengthy postponement to the executions, Mr Yuspahruddin said.</td></tr>
