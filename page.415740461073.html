<h3>Germanwings plane crash: victims' remains airlifted from remote Alps site</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Seyne-les-Alpes: Helicopters have begun airlifting the remains of the victims of the Germanwings plane crash from the disaster site in the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>French President Francois Hollande has vowed the remains of the 150 passengers and crew who died when a Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed will be found and returned home to grieving relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A rescue worker climbs past debris at the crash site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Everything will be done so that we can find, identify and give back to the families of the victims their bodies," Mr Hollande said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said there "might be possible access for the families" to the remote crash site, which is inaccessible by road or foot, and where even helicopters cannot land because there is nowhere flat enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Recovery crews, doctors and investigators must be lowered onto the mountainside by cables.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Their task then is to preserve the debris in packages that must be hauled up to the hovering helicopters, said Fabrice Rouve, 46, an experienced rescue worker and former soldier who now works with the High Mountain division of the gendarme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Every non-Alpine-trained official at the scene - doctors, investigators and airplane engineers - must be accompanied by an Alpine rescuer to ensure that he or she does not slip and tumble down the mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There are worries, as well, that intruders will find a way to reach the crash site and disturb the debris, which is essential to the investigation, said Rouve, so five gendarme were being left overnight to guard the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Rouve said that the initial rescue workers who reached the scene on Tuesday had scoured the area, looking for movement or sounds from any potential survivors, but that they had not heard or seen anything to suggest that anyone might have lived through the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Officials have warned that recovering and identifying victims, potentially using DNA, will take weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Local prosecutor Brice Robin on Wednesday said forensic officers were already "making notes and beginning to identify bodies".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"But ... it will not be done in five minutes," he told reporters through a translator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's going to take a number of weeks and everybody should be well aware that we are talking about a long time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The victims are from at least 15 countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Germanwings says there were 72 Germans on board the doomed flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Another 49 victims were Spanish, according to Madrid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, is arranging two flights from Spain and Germany to take family members of the victims to visit the accident site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Victims from Argentina, Belgium, Britain, Colombia, Denmark, Iran, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United States and Venezuela have also been reported by the airline or national governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Among those who died were a newlywed couple hoping to settle in Dusseldorf, the flight's destination; opera singers Oleg Bryjak, a bass baritone, and Maria Radner, a contralto; the wife of a Catalan politician, and a mother with her 7-month-old baby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>There were 16 high school students and two of their teachers, returning to Germany after a week at an exchange program outside of Barcelona, where the flight took off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Melbourne nurse Carol Friday, 68, and her son Greig, a 29-year-old engineer, are believed to be the only Australians killed in the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Many locals in Seynes-les-Alpes, a village of 1400, spontaneously offered to lend a hand in any way they could, as if wanting to make amends for the destruction in what almost all local people refer to as "our mountains."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>While authorities were making plans to help hundreds of families of the victims travel to the village, locals came forward with offers to open their homes to them because hotel rooms in the region are scarce, said mayor Francis Hermitte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Villagers set up a temporary chapel in a school gymnasium for the families to pray and be alone, and educators at the local high school who know other languages offered to act as translators for the families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Rene Vaugeois, who retired here more than 10 years ago said the mountain environment that had brought him so much happiness was now enveloped in sadness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We are very moved, those are our mountains, we hike there every summer and we've done every peak here," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Asked whether he would take victims' families into his home, he did not hesitate: "I would do it."</td></tr>
