<h3>Egypt death sentences worry U.S., U.N., Turkey</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States and United Nations expressed deep concern on Monday about the death sentences handed down in Egypt for President Mohamed Mursi and other Islamists, while Turkey warned of Middle East turmoil if they are carried out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he will closely monitor the appeals process for the death sentences and urged actions that would promote the rule of law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The U.S. State Department said Egypt's practice of mass trials and sentences was unjust and often used against members of the opposition or non-violent activists.</td></tr>
