<h3>US in Chicago terrorism case: Don't let defense utter 'Snowden' name in jurors' presence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO - Prosecutors want a federal judge in a Chicago terrorism case to prohibit the defense from mentioning Edward Snowden at a 21-year-old suspect's upcoming trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Wednesday government filing is in Adel Daoud's case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He's pleaded not guilty to trying to ignite a bomb outside a Chicago bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An appeals court last year denied a defense request to go through Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court records on Daoud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The defense had argued the records could help with trial preparation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was Snowden who disclosed how that court secretly approved expanded U.S. surveillance methods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prosecutors worry the defense could seek to blurt out Snowden's name and related topics at Daoud's July trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They say the defense shouldn't be able "to encourage the jury to disregard the evidence because of the means of collection."</td></tr>
