<h3>Lava lake on Hawaii's volcano overflows in spectacular show</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HONOLULU (AP) - A lake of lava on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has been rising over the past week and, at times, overflowing in a spectacular show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Video posted online by visitors shows lava splashing over the side of the vent rim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Janet Babb, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said Thursday that this is the first time lava from this vent has come into view from a public platform within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Hawaii's Big Island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's always been out of view for visitors who were in the park public viewing areas," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But this past week, because of lava is rising inside the volcano, the lava lake rose high enough that it was visible, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The last time molten lava was visible in the crater was in 1982 when a fissure erupted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The last time there was a lake was in 1974.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The vent within Halemaumau Crater opened in March, 2008 and has been rising and falling since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Even at its highest level in October 2012, the lake was too low for people to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>During the day people could view the gas rising from the lake, and at night people could see the orange glow from the lava.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>From the early 1800s up until 1924, there was a continuous lake of lava at Kilauea summit within Halemaumau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At that time, the crater was about half the diameter of what it is now, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 1924 there was a huge eruption inside the volcano that doubled the size of the crater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since 1924, lava lakes have been present at different times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In 1967 and 1968 the entire crater was filled with molten lava, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>You can still see a "bathtub ring" on the walls of the crater where the lava had risen to at that time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As of Thursday morning, the lava was beginning to recede slightly, part of its natural ebb and flow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Earlier this week, officials at the park released a statement asking visitors to be prepared for large crowds.</td></tr>
