<h3>Facebook's new Riff app let's friends collaborate on videos</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook released a new video app, and no, it's not another rip off of Meerkat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Riff is a video app that lets friends collaborate on videos by adding up to 20-second clips to an existing stream.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The creation starts with a video and topic, such as #AprilFools, then after watching the original video, friends can add their own clip to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The process can continue for as long as it needs to and multiple people can participate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Our hunch was that if you could make videos collaboratively, the creative process would be more fun and the final product would be cooler," said Josh Miller, Facebook product manager, in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Once the video stream is complete, it can be shared on Facebook or anywhere else on the Internet for others to watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The cast of the Broadway show "An American in Paris" had the opportunity to test the app and created a backstage video that features clips for various cast members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Riff debuted Wednesday on both iOS and Android phones and will be available in 15 languages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The app began as a side project from Facebook engineers at the Facebook Creative Labs, who are also responsible for developing Mentions, Facebook Groups, Slingshot and Paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some of these side projects - like Slingshot - have not been successful, but it's too early to tell if Riff will take off.</td></tr>
