<h3>How a wedding gown designer took the fight against Ebola to New York Fashion Week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This was definitely not how Jill Andrews imagined making her way to New York Fashion Week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the Baltimore wedding gown designer couldn't be prouder of the garment she displayed in Manhattan this weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That loose-fitting yellow jumpsuit draped elegantly over a pouty mannequin at the Empire Hotel Friday night?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was her own one-of-a-kind creation - a prototype protective suit for health care workers fighting Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The suit was the product of a "hackathon" organised last year by Johns Hopkins University in the quest to improve upon the standard protective suits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jhpiego, a global health non-profit and affiliate of Johns Hopkins University, showcases an advanced protective suit for healthcare workers who treat Ebola patients during an event at New York Fashion Week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An email circled campus asking for volunteers to spend a weekend trying everything and anything to improve the safety of the gear that health care workers across the globe wear when treating patients with Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Applications flooded in from biomedical engineers, doctors, infection control specialists, accomplished students, experienced researchers ... and Andrews, a graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology, who designs bridal wear at her own small Charm City atelier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some people questioned what a woman normally surrounded by taffeta and lace could have to offer to the highly-technical challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A look at the advance in the suit design made by Jill Andrews and the Johns Hopkins team with personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by healthcare workers treating Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Four months later, Andrews laughs as she wonders what the Johns Hopkins team would have done without her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The university's team, with the help of Andrews's sewing skills and global health nonprofit Jhpiego, designed a safer, more efficient PPE (personal protective equipment) that could contribute to stopping the spread of Ebola by protecting the people treating the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>We wrote about how Andrews helped create the new and improved Ebola suit back in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The advanced protective suit for healthcare workers who treat Ebola patients is on show during Fashion Week event in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The next month, the redesigned PPE won the challenge posed by the US Agency for International Development, which was looking for innovations to "provide better, more timely care and to contain this devastating virus."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This meant USAID would provide $US1.7 million ($2.18 million) for the three winning ideas to undergo extensive testing, followed by mass production and use in the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But first, Andrews got to take the Ebola suit to Fashion Week, where Jhpiego had partnered with the International Rescue Committee and the GE Foundation to present a pop-up lounge on Friday night at the Empire Hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Fashion Week is about new designs," said Dr David Barash, chief medical officer of the GE Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Innovation was so important to the way Jhpiego approached the PPE.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"To have a wedding designer participate was in itself creative and thoughtful. Her engagement helped bring down the number of steps it takes to remove the suit from 20 to eight, from a 20 minute process to a 5 minute one. It was an extraordinary accomplishment if you think about it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Andrews spent many late nights transforming the suit from prototype to reality, including when USAID presented it to Ebola Czar Ron Klain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She beamed with pride when she was told her "baby" also made a trip to the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But looking ahead to her trip last week, Andrews was more nervous about finishing a wedding gown in time for a Valentine's Day bride than her unlikely New York Fashion Week debut.</td></tr>

<h3>In Cuba, U.S. senators see path for end to U.S. embargo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"The talks will be held on the 27th (of February) here at the State Department," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a daily briefing for reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The sides held historic negotiations in Havana last month and the next round is seen by U.S. officials as critical to fleshing out details on re-establishing ties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In particular, the United States wants to reopen the U.S. embassy in Havana before Cuba is officially removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It also wants travel restrictions on U.S. diplomatic staff in Cuba lifted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cuba made clear in last month's talks that it first wants to be removed from the terrorism list and wants Washington to halt support for Cuban political dissidents, a step the United States has firmly rejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The two countries agreed on Dec. 17 to begin the process of restoring ties after more than five decades of hostility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama has already started to lift barriers to trade and travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While renewing diplomatic relations could happen quickly, the process to normalize, including removing the U.S. trade embargo, will take far longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Republican and Democratic senators have introduced two separate bills to lift travel restrictions on Americans going to Cuba and to repeal the 53-year-old embargo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Although both bills face serious opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate and House of Representatives, they do have some Republican support from legislators such as Senator Jeff Flake, lead sponsor of the travel bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Democratic senators Claire McCaskill, Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar concluded a four-day visit to Cuba on Tuesday and said they were optimistic about building bipartisan support for an end to the embargo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>McCaskill said largely Republican agricultural interests in the Midwest supported lifting the embargo as "they really want to sell rice down here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"So it is the business community and agricultural community who I think might have the most influence on helping us make this effort more bipartisan," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Advocates for ending the embargo need 60 of 100 votes in the Senate and a majority in the House, where there are pockets of strong, mostly Republican opposition to Obama's new Cuba policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But McCaskill said opposition to other bills has been overcome when House Speaker John Boehner has allowed the entire House to vote on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"This could be one of those times, especially if the Chamber of Commerce and the commodities groups and the Farm Bureaus of the world really start putting political pressure on their own party," McCaskill said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has long opposed the U.S. trade embargo as a violation of the principle that government should not impede free enterprise, also a tenet of the Republican Party.</td></tr>
