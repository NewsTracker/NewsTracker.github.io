<h3>Man who opened fire on officers in Ferguson critically injured: County police chief [Photos] [Video]</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FERGUSON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>-- A man who authorities say opened fire on officers in Ferguson, Missouri, on the anniversary of Michael Brown's death was critically wounded when the officers shot back, St. Louis County's police chief said early Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference that officers had been tracking the man, who they believed was armed, during a protest marking the death of Brown, the black, unarmed 18-year-old whose killing by a white Ferguson police officer touched off a national "Black Lives Matter" movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The man approached the officers, who were in an unmarked police van, and opened fire, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The officers returned fire from inside the vehicle and then pursued the man on foot when he ran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The man again fired on the officers, the chief said, and all four officers fired back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was struck and fell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The man was taken to a hospital, where Belmar said he was in "critical, unstable" condition.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>None of the officers was seriously injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>All four have been put on standard administrative leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They were not wearing body cameras, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The shooting happened shortly after a separate incident that the chief called "an exchange of gunfire between two groups" rang out around 11:15 p.m. Sunday while protesters were gathered on West Florissant Avenue, a business zone that saw rioting and looting last year after Brown's killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The shots sent protesters and reporters running for cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The chief said an estimated six shooters unleashed a "remarkable" amount of gunfire over about 45 seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Belmar waved off any notion that the people with the weapons were part of the protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"They were criminals. They weren't protesters," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The man who fired on officers had a semi-automatic 9 mm gun that was stolen last year from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, according to the chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"There is a small group of people out there that are intent on making sure that peace doesn't prevail," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There are a lot of emotions. I get it. But we can't sustain this as we move forward."</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>He is being held on $100,000 bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The anniversary of Brown's killing, which cast greater scrutiny on how police interact with black communities, has sparked days of renewed protests, though until Sunday they had been peaceful and without any arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Before the gunfire, protesters were blocking traffic and confronting police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>One person threw a glass bottle at officers but missed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>For the first time in three consecutive nights of demonstrations, some officers were dressed in riot gear, including bullet-proof vests and helmets with shields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Police at one point early Monday shot smoke to disperse the crowd that lingered on West Florissant, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>One officer was treated for cuts after a rock was thrown at his face, and two officers were pepper-sprayed by protesters, county police spokesman Officer Shawn McGuire said in an email.</td></tr>
