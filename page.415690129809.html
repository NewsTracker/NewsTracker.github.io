<h3>AP Source: Threat against Obama niece prompts security hike (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- A threat against President Barack Obama's niece, a player on Princeton's women's basketball team, prompted increased security at the Tigers' NCAA Tournament game at Maryland on Monday night, according to a person familiar with the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no details were released about the threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Princeton lost to Maryland 85-70 on Monday in the second round of the tournament at the Terrapins' arena, the Tigers' only defeat of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Saturday, President Obama attended Princeton's 80-70 victory over Wisconsin-Green Bay in the first round, inevitably drawing attention to his niece, freshman forward Leslie Robinson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Her father, Craig Robinson, is the brother of first lady Michelle Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A phone message threatening Leslie Robinson was left at Maryland and the threat was taken seriously, according to the person who spoke to the AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The threat was first reported by USA Today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After Monday's game, Princeton coach Courtney Banghart confirmed that she was aware of the threat before tipoff but Leslie Robinson was not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The player did not appear in either of Princeton's NCAA Tournament games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''It's incredibly disappointing that the first question we get (after) being 31-1 (and) in the NCAA Tournament is about a freak,'' Banghart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''College Park police, I'm sure, had that under control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Leslie is safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She's in my locker room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>No one loves her like I do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She's an important part of our team,'' Banghart added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Neither the president nor the first lady attended Monday's game, although Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan sat near Princeton's bench.</td></tr>
