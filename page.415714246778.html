<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The boss of Lufthansa - which owns the low-cost airline - said he understood the crew members' feelings following the deadly crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"One must not forget: many of our Germanwings crews have known crew members who were onboard the crashed plane," Carsten Spohr said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It is now more important to ensure psychological assistance if needed. And we will get back to a full flight operation as soon as possible then. But for me, this is rather secondary now," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Separately, at least 30 flights across Europe are thought to have been delayed or cancelled, according to local reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Long queues are said to be forming at Germanwings information desks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a statement earlier, Germanwings boss Thomas Winkelmann said:"Following the tragic accident on Tuesday, Germanwings reports occasional flight disruptions within its route network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is due to crew members, who decided not to operate aircraft today following the reports on the accident of a Germanwings aircraft with 144 passengers and six crew members onboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The cancelled Germanwings flights include: 18:25 from Dusseldorf to London Heathrow, 17:40 from Berlin Tegel to London Heathrow and 14:40 from Cologne to London Heathrow.</td></tr>
