<h3>Islamic State images purport to show destroyed Syrian temple</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This undated photo released Tuesday, Aug. 25, 2015 on a social media site used by Islamic State militants, which has been verified and is consistent with other AP reporting, shows smoke from the detonation of the 2,000-year-old temple of Baalshamin in Syria's ancient caravan city of Palmyra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A resident of the city said the temple was destroyed on Sunday, a month after the group's militants booby-trapped it with explosives.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>BEIRUT (AP) - The Islamic State group released propaganda images Tuesday that purport to show militants laying explosives in and then blowing up the 2,000-year-old temple of Baalshamin in Syria's ancient caravan city of Palmyra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The images, posted on social media by supporters of the group, showed militants carrying barrels of explosives, and laying them inside the temple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Other smaller wired cans lay around the temple walls and columns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Then an image shows a grey plume of smoke rising above the temple from a distance, and then an image of the temple reduced to a pile of rocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One caption read: "The complete destruction of the pagan Baalshamin temple."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Associated Press could not independently verify the images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, they were released like other group propaganda and carried a logo it often used in the city of Palmyra, in Syria's central Homs province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The images also corresponded to prior AP reporting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A resident of Palmyra had told the AP the temple was destroyed on Sunday, a month after the group's militants booby-trapped it with explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The U.N. cultural agency UNESCO on Monday called the destruction of the temple a war crime.</td></tr>
