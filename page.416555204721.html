<h3>'He won't take this lying down': Condemned drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran vows to stare down firing squad... as Bali Nine duo choose execution witnesses</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Condemned Bali Nine drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran has pledged to stare down the Indonesian firing squad who will drag him to a jungle clearing and kill him shortly after midnight Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That's according close supporter and artist Ben Quilty, who has taken to the airwaves in a desperate final bid to stop Sukumaran and fellow Australian inmate Andrew Chan's execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'Myuran always said to me he would never take this lying down,' Mr Quilty told Radio 2GB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As a 'realistic' Mr Quilty pledged to fight the death penalty 'with everything I have for the rest of my life', the Australian duo selected the spiritual advisers who will accompany them to their execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fairfax Media reported Sukumaran has nominated his friend Christie Buckingham, a senior pastor at Melbourne's Bayside Church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Meanwhile, Chan has asked Salvation Army minister David Soper - a family friend - to accompany him to the clearing known as Death Valley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Chan and Sukumaran families took a boat from Cilacap to the island of Nusakambangan on Monday morning for some of their last hours with their loved ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They initially left the Cilicap port followed by Australia's consul-general to Bali, Majell Hind, and lawyer Julian McMahon after it was believed they were told the visitation rules had changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The families have now received notice they will be required to make their final goodbyes on Tuesday afternoon, around 2pm local time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Australians will be executed just after the stroke of midnight local time on Wednesday (3am AEST).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran both refused to sign their execution warrants when they were given 72 hours notice of their deaths during official proceedings on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The pair said they believed it would be unjust to kill them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr McMahon told Radio 3AW the pair were 'magnificently' calm when they were told of their executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chan has requested fresh air and to attend a church service with his family prior to the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As for Sukumaran, he has asked for as much time to paint as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Quilty said he was confident 'Myu' will face death with 'strength and dignity'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'But he has never been able to forgive himself for what he put his mum through, and his little sister, and his little brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'He will face it with strength and dignity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I know that about him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Because he won't want his mother to think he's a weeping mess at the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'He'll want his mum to think he's brave and strong and dignified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Bribery claims around the death sentences of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan must be investigated urgently as the pair await their execution within days, their lawyer is arguing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Muhammad Rifan, the lawyer who represented the Bali Nine pair when they were sentenced to death in 2006, has told Fairfax Media judges asked for more than $130,000 for a lighter sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr Rifan raised the claims months ago - without putting a sum on the bribe - and the men's current lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis, has already lodged a complaint with the judicial commission, which appears to have stalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mr Lubis says the commission has an obligation to finish its probe and it's not too late to stop the firing squad, which is set for Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>'We appeal to the attorney-general, we appeal to the president in the name of due process of law, in the name of fairness and justice, not to do the executions,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mr Lubis says claims the men face execution because of a corrupt system must be urgently investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'I know that we are counting the hours,' Mr Lubis told reporters at Cilacap before visiting the Australians.</td></tr>
