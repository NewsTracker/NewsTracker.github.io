<h3>Apple finally puts women onstage</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The big news at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference always revolves around new apps and updated operating systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Monday's event marked a completely different turning point for Apple: Women took the stage during a keynote presentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, appeared before the crowd of software developers and journalists on Monday to discuss progress in mobile payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A second woman, Susan Prescott, gave the pitch for Apple's forthcoming News app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It marks the first time female executives have made an on-stage appearance during an Apple keynote presentation since 2010, when Zynga's Jen Herman gave a demonstration of the game Farmville.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Like its competitors, Apple wants to be seen as working against the image of Silicon Valley as a male-dominated industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Over the weekend, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that the industry needs to do a better job on gender issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The company's much-hyped and highly-scrutinized public events have long been noticeable for the absence of prominent women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Christy Turlington, a legendary fashion model, was the only woman to appear during the recent Apple Watch presentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If you're keeping track of these presentations as a way to measure progress towards gender equality in Silicon Valley, you could easily make the case that Turlington's cameo should actually count against Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Few people are complaining about a lack of beautiful women being used to draw attention to gadgets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Arguably the biggest news of the day-Google Now on Tap -was presented by Aparna Chennapragada, the company's director of product management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Chennapragada was one of three women who spoke during the keynote presentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ellie Powers, product manager for Google Play, has presented for three years running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The last time a Google didn't have a woman on stage during its annual I/O keynote was 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Microsoft also seemed to make a point of having more women on stage at the keynote for its developer conference, Build, held in late April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Three women took the stage for the keynote, walking through technical subjects like SQL databases and Saas applications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At the 2014 conference, the only female voice on stage came from Cortana, who sounds like a lady but is really a piece of artificial intelligence technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Developers conferences have never been a paragon of gender diversity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A regular tradition at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference are tweeted photos showing a line for the men's room that extends down the hall next to a completely empty women's bathroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When female developers had to wait to use the facilities at I/O this year, some people actually held it up as a triumph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Of course, counting keynote speakers and measuring bathroom lines isn't a perfect way to measure the current levels of gender inequality in the tech industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Google's workforce isn't actually any more diverse than Apple's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>About 30 per cent of each company's employees are women, according to recent diversity reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Apple actually employs more women in tech positions than Google (20 per cent versus 18 per cent), and women make up a higher percentage of leadership positions (28 per cent to 22 per cent.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There are three women on Google's board compared to Apple's two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Microsoft lags behind both companies, with only 17 per cent of its tech jobs and 18 per cent of its leadership roles held by women.</td></tr>
