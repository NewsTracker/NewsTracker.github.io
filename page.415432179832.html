<h3>Families of 9 Newtown victims sue estate of shooter's mother, seeking to collect on insurance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- The families of nine people killed in the Newtown elementary school shooting have filed lawsuits against the estate of the gunman's mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The lawsuits contend Nancy Lanza failed to properly secure her legally owned Bushmaster AR-15 rifle, which her troubled adult son, Adam Lanza, used to kill 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, the Connecticut Post reported Friday (http://bit.ly/1x1YUHP).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Adam Lanza killed his mother at their Newtown home before carrying out the school shooting and committing suicide as police arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The lawsuits seek to collect on Nancy Lanza's homeowner's insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bridgeport lawyer Josh Koskoff, representing eight of the families suing, said homeowner's insurance applies when a person is injured as a result of an unsecured firearm in a home being accessed by a third party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"With this many claimants, the money ends up being a symbolic gesture, but it serves as an important reminder that people who keep firearms in the home must be scrupulous about securing their weapons," Koskoff said in a statement, adding that the policy is estimated to be worth between $1 million and $1.5 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Eight of the lawsuits were filed in Superior Court in Bridgeport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One was filed in Danbury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Attorney John Majewski, who represents Nancy Lanza's estate, is seeking to have all the cases consolidated into one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He didn't immediately return a message seeking comment Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A judge has set a status conference on the eight lawsuits in Bridgeport Superior Court for April 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Koskoff's law firm also is suing the maker and sellers of the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle on behalf of families of the school shooting victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The wrongful-death and negligence lawsuit says the rifle should not have been sold for civilian use because of its overwhelming firepower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bushmaster, which on its website has a warning against improper or careless handling of its firearms, hasn't filed a response to the lawsuit in federal court but has indicated it intends to file a motion to dismiss it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Newtown officials bought the Lanzas' home from Nancy Lanza's estate for $1 and voted in January to tear it down.</td></tr>

<h3>Final polls say Benjamin Netanyahu is on pace to lose Israel's election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu listens to an adviser during the vote to dissolve the Knesset (Israel's Parliament), on Dec. 3, 2014, in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Final opinion polls on Friday put Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party four seats behind its center-left rival with four days to go before a general election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Several polls released Friday - the last day opinion surveys can be released before Tuesday's vote - showed the Zionist Union pulling further ahead of Likud after an intense campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu, who gambled by calling the vote nearly two years early after his government coalition fell apart late last year, has warned Israel's security will be at risk if his rivals win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the opposition's call for change after nearly six years of rule by the divisive Netanyahu appears to have been heard by many voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A poll in the top-selling Yediot Aharonot newspaper showed the Zionist Union winning 26 of the 120 seats in the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, against 22 for Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Other polls for the Jerusalem Post and Maariv dailies, and for Israeli public radio, also showed a four-seat gap, with the Zionist Union taking 25 seats to 21 for Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>All the polls showed the Joint List, a newly formed alliance of Israel's main Arab parties, in third, with 13 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The centrist Yesh Atid of former finance minister Yair Lapid and the far-right Jewish Home were both expected to win at least 11 seats, the polls showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Zionist Union was created in December by fusing Israel's once-dominant Labour party with the centrist HaTnuah led by Tzipi Livni, Israel's former chief peace negotiator with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Should they form the next government, the parties have agreed on a two-year rotation for the premiership, with Herzog taking the first tenure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under Israel's proportional vote system, instead of electing individual members of the Knesset voters choose party lists, with seats distributed according to the percentage of the vote received.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Friday's polls left Likud shaken, with spokeswoman Noga Katz reiterating Netanyahu's call on right-wingers to support his party over smaller parties on the right and far-right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If the gap between Likud and Labour does not close, there's a real danger that Tzipi and Bougie (Herzog's nickname) will become prime minister by rotation, with the support of the Arab list," she said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The electorate of the nationalist camp do not, this time, have the privilege to vote for small rightwing parties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even if it does win the most seats, the Zionist Union will not necessarily be tasked with forming the next government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>With polls showing Netanyahu's natural allies on the right likely to win the most seats overall, he has a clear advantage in piecing together a coalition and may instead be tasked by President Reuven Rivlin with forming a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yediot Aharonot analyst Sima Kadmon said a lot could still change before polling stations open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"As has been proven in previous elections, four days is a long time," she wrote on Friday, pointing out that over the same period in the run-up to the January 2013 election Yesh Atid gained four to five seats over what polls had forecast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The way down is even quicker," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"A party with a negative momentum could find itself on Tuesday night with fewer seats than the last poll predicted."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Naftali Bennett, head of the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home, called for a united pre-election rally of the right to be held in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"On Sunday at 7:00 pm there will be a big rally of the national camp," he said in a video posted on his Facebook site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A Likud spokesman said the event was not being organised by Netanyahu's party but it was likely that Likud supporters would attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>As Israel prepared to go to the polls, Israeli troops opened fire with live bullets towards more than 100 stone-throwing protesters in the northern West Bank, wounding a teenager who was shot through the ankle, medics and an AFP correspondent said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The clashes took place on the outskirts of Jazalun refugee camp near Ramallah, amid simmering tension in the occupied Palestinian territories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Palestinians are keen for a change from Netanyahu, hoping for a more suitable partner for future peace talks.</td></tr>
