<h3>Cabrera hits 400th homer, Tigers outlast Cards 4-3 in 10 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Miguel Cabrera's bat gave the Detroit Tigers a smashing start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His under-rated defense helped save them late.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cabrera hit his 400th career home run and turned a nifty double play with a catch near the first base stands followed by an on-target throw in a 4-3, 10-inning victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''He's definitely the best hitter in baseball and he's hands down the smartest player in baseball as well,'' starter David Price said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cabrera's milestone shot gave him the most homers by a Venezuelan-born player, passing Andres Galarraga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The solo shot came in the first inning just before a rain delay of 1 hour, 20 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''That means a lot to me,'' Cabrera said about the milestone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nearly five hours later, Jose Iglesias had an RBI single for the go-ahead hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Cabrera has hit four homers in three games, 10 overall and 262 with Detroit, tying him with Willie Horton for fourth on the franchise list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Cabrera said he wasn't sure if he got the 400th home run ball back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Adrian Beltre of Texas hit his 400th homer Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cabrera tied Beltre for 52nd place on the career list, with Duke Snider next at 407.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Cardinals had a man on second with none out in the eighth when Cabrera caught a foul popup near the stands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He wheeled and threw out pinch runner Pete Kozma, who was trying to tag up and advance to third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''It was a crazy play,'' Cabrera said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Price threw only a couple of pitches before the rain delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He surrendered three homers, matching the total he'd allowed his first seven starts, but all were with the bases empty on changeups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''It was some good swings on some pitches down the middle of the plate, and that's what good hitters do,'' Price said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Matt Carpenter, Peter Bourjos and Jhonny Peralta connected, but the Cardinals made three costly base-running goofs in the final three innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Blaine Hardy (1-0) struck out two with a walk in the ninth and Joakim Soria finished for his 12th save in 12 chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Detroit, which pasted St. Louis 10-4 in the opener, will go for a three-game interleague sweep on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Iglesias, the eighth-place hitter, flied out with the bases loaded to end the third and popped out with two on to finish the fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He came through with two outs in the 10th against Matt Belisle (1-1).</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>J.D. Martinez drew a leadoff walk and Yoenis Cespedes followed with a single.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Two outs later, Iglesias singled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Cardinals blew a chance to take the lead in the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Jason Heyward stayed near second base, waiting to tag up, and could only reach third when Randal Grichuk's flyball hit the wall for a double.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''I looked at the ball, checked the outfielder and I was thinking to myself 'This is so high I think it's either going to be gone or caught at the wall,'' Heyward added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With the Cardinals down a run, Matt Holliday was out trying to stretch a single to two bases leading off the 10th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Carpenter's seventh homer tied it in the bottom of the first, on just the second at-bat after play resumed following the delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Bourjos had been 1 for 11 against Price before putting the Cardinals ahead in the second with his first homer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Tigers: Alfredo Simon (4-1, 3.05) was 2-0 in three starts against St. Louis last year while with Cincinnati.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Cardinals: Lance Lynn (2-3, 3.27) is 28-13 with a 2.83 ERA at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Tigers: Pitcher Shane Greene underwent an MRI exam and Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said ''concern is way down.'' On Saturday, he was removed due to numbness in his pitching hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Cespedes bent his glove thumb attempting a diving catch in the 10th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Cardinals: Pitcher Jaime Garcia (shoulder) was back in St. Louis a day after throwing six innings in his second rehab start and could be close to rejoining the rotation.</td></tr>
