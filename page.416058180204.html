<h3>Pakistan judge orders former CIA lawyer, agent be charged</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former acting general counsel John A. Rizzo and ex-station chief Jonathan Bank must face charges including murder, conspiracy, waging war against Pakistan and terrorism, Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui of the Islamabad High Court ruled.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>The disclosure didn't prevent Bank from landing another sensitive job: He became chief of the Iran operations division at CIA headquarters at Langley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He later was removed from that post after CIA officials concluded he created a hostile work environment in the division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He has since been detailed to the Pentagon's intelligence arm.</td></tr>
