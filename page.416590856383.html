<h3>Dolphins' Dion Jordan suspended for 2015 season (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DAVIE, Fla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Dion Jordan's 2015 season is over before it started, and his tumultuous time with the Miami Dolphins may be finished as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Dolphins and the NFL announced Tuesday that Jordan has been suspended for the 2015 season for violating the NFL Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The defensive end was not at any of the team's voluntary workouts last week, raising plenty of eyebrows about his status and his future with the Dolphins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''We were disappointed to learn about Dion Jordan's most recent suspension for violating the NFL's Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse,'' the Dolphins said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''A player's health and well-being are of the utmost importance to us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jordan's agent, Doug Hendrickson, did not respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The news came two days before the start of the NFL draft, and will likely have at least some effect on the Dolphins' strategy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Miami has the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>14 selection in the first round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jordan would have earned about $5.6 million this season, a figure that includes a prorated portion of his $13.3 million signing bonus and a $585,000 base salary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jordan's arrival was much ballyhooed, and has been mostly booed ever since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Dolphins - then with Jeff Ireland as general manager - traded the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>12 and No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>42 picks in the 2013 draft to Oakland in order to move up and select Jordan with the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>3 overall selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As a rookie, Jordan had 26 total tackles and two sacks, never exactly meeting the expectations that accompanied being selected so highly and signing a contract worth about $20.6 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Then in 2014, the trouble really started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jordan was suspended for the first four games on the Dolphins' schedule last season for violating the NFL's drug policy, then had two more games tacked on after an additional violation was found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In all, Jordan appeared in 26 games with one start for the Dolphins, totaling 46 tackles and three sacks.</td></tr>
