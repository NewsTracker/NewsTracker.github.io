<h3>Egypt, Emirati Developers Tout Nebulous Plan for New Capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The idea is colossal: building an eco-friendly city the size of Singapore in the desert outside Cairo, a sleek new capital fit for the 21st century where a diverse slice of society will live in harmony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Of the projects unveiled at the corporate jamboree that was Egypt's economic conference last weekend, "The Capital Cairo" is the biggest and least transparent endeavor, the latest mega-project ordered by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to kick-start an ailing economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There will be leafy mixed-use neighborhoods, housing for up to 7 million people, 2,000 schools, shopping malls, solar energy farms, efficient public transport, skyscrapers, a million new jobs and even a central park more than twice the size of New York City's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It's everything missing from Egypt today - with a price tag of up to $80 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>For urban planners, the project - described as "a dream of what could become reality" - is a mystery, hastily conceived with no concrete information on funding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Questions stick out over the actual demand for so many units, who will build required infrastructure and how to attract a diverse cross-section of society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Is a flashy Dubai-style city feasible in impoverished Egypt?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"No one's looked at it on any serious scale ... It is more like a scripted media event than a serious proposal, reflecting the current government's obsession with foreign, Gulf investments somehow coming to Egypt's rescue," said Cairo-based urban planner David Sims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Real estate is now considered the engine of Egypt's growth and what better way to stimulate it, in spite of the dismal record of new desert towns to date, than to proclaim a colossal new capital?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Crowds flocked to a scale model of the city during the conference in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, where companies and states committed $36 billion in investments and billions more in preliminary agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In his closing remarks, el-Sissi said he was "in a hurry" to see the new capital built and urged work done faster than the original 10-year timeframe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Peopling the desert with new cities has been an obsession of successive presidents in the Arab world's most populous country, but after decades of work and billions spent, occupancy rates are a fraction of original forecasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Drawing Egyptians to new sites has been a major challenge, with high prices, lack of infrastructure, and few jobs in the areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>All that will change with the new project, initiators say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The new plan falls under the auspices of the Housing Ministry and will be built by an Emirati-led fund called Capital City Partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Founding partner Mohamed Alabbar said clear profit incentives will encourage the private sector to lead the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Alabbar is chairman of Emaar Properties, the Emirati real estate developer behind large-scale projects like the record-breaking Burj Khalifa skyscraper and Downtown Dubai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"If you really want growth, if you want a great percentage of return, then this is the place in the Middle East ... For us as businessmen, the numbers make sense," he said in Sharm el-Sheikh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I like to do big things in big countries where I know the economy and the people, and I know how eager the government (is) to move forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"In Egypt, I'll bite any risk any day," he added.</td></tr>
