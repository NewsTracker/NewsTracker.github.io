<h3>Main Witness In Nemtsov Slaying Case: 'I Didn't See Killer'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Anna Durytska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian model, left Moscow for Ukraine late on March 2 after three days of questioning during which she said she was under constant guard by Russian law enforcement authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Ukrainian diplomats in Moscow provided all the necessary assistance for her return home," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Yevhen Perebyinis wrote on his Twitter feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lawyer Vadim Prokhorov, who flew to Kyiv with Durytska, told journalists at the airport that she "needs to rest" after days of questioning following "the death of a person close to her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Durytska told Ekho Moskvy radio in a telephone interview on March 2 that she had been questioned by investigators every day since Nemtsov was shot as they walked across a bridge just off Red Square late on February 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I have given all possible evidence and done everything possible -- I have told them everything I know," she said in an interview that was interrupted when Durytska's guards told her they were taking her to Investigative Committee headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, was a reformist politician who served as deputy prime minister in the 1990s and became a fierce foe of President Vladimir Putin, helping lead protests against his rule and authoring reports alleging massive corruption among senior officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tens of thousands of people walked through Moscow to the site of his slaying on March 1 in a mourning march organized by the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Durytska told Ekho Moskvy she had met Nemtsov in a cafe at a mall close to the Kremlin and that they were walking to his home when he was killed on the Bolshoi Moskvoretsky Bridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a separate interview with Russian internet and TV channel Dozhd, Durytska said that she was able to see a light-colored car leaving the scene when she turned back, but did not make out the model or license-plate number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I didn't see any attacker getting into the car, either," Durytska said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She told Ekho Moskvy that after the killing, she ran to the driver of a public-utility vehicle nearby to ask him how to call an ambulance and police, but that she did not remember what he looked like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Speaking to Dozhd via Skype, Durytska said her mother was ill, under stress, and anxiously awaiting her return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Durytska said that she had known Nemtsov for three years and ruled out the possibility that Nemtsov's killing might have been linked to jealousy over their relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Russian investigators said personal animus was one of several possible motives in the killing, which Putin called a "provocation" -- a term meant to absolve himself of any blame and suggest his opponents could have killed Nemtsov to blacken the government's reputation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Durytska told Ekho Moskvy that investigators had told her she might have to take a polygrpah exam, but Nemtsov family lawyer Vadim Prokhorov said that her current emotional, psychological, and physical state would not allow it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earlier, Durytska's mother, Inna Durytska, who lives in Kyiv, told Ukrainian channel TSN that her daughter's virtual house arrest made her fear foul play on the part of investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"She is under constant guard, she can't even leave [the flat]," she said, adding she suspected investigators wanted somehow to tie Nemtsov's killing to Ukraine, where Kyiv is battling pro-Russian separatists in a conflict that has killed more than 6,000 people since April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on February 28 that Nemtsov told him about two weeks earlier that he planned to publish evidence of direct Russian military involvement in the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On the same day, the Russian Investigatve Committee said that Nemtsov's killing could have been related to the war, saying in a statement that "it is no secret that among both sides in the conflict there are radical people who have no allegiance to any authorities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On March 1, the Investigative Committee said that because Durytska was a "direct witness" of the killing, "there are grounds to conduct further investigative activities with her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I am afraid that she will be made into a second Nadia Savchenko," Durytska's mother said, referring to the Ukrainian pilot who has been on hunger strike for 80 days in custody in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Savchenko has been charged with involvement in the death of two Russian journalists in the conflict between government forces and Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She says she was illegally transferred to Russia.</td></tr>

<h3>Iraq third large-scale military operation to recapture Tikrit from ISIS faces major opposition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But hours into the operation, a key test for the embattled Iraqi army, the military said it still hadn't entered the city of Tikrit, indicating a long battle lies ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>State-run Al-Iraqiya television said that forces were attacking Tikrit from different directions, backed by artillery and airstrikes by Iraqi fighter jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It said the militants were dislodged from some areas outside the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Several hours into the operation, it gave no additional details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The military commander of Salahuddin region, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, told state TV the operation was "going on as planned," with fighting taking place outside Tikrit mainly on its eastern side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Until this moment we have not entered the city," al-Saadi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"God willing, we will enter, but we need some time as planned. & God willing, victory will be achieved and Salahuddin will be turned into a grave for all terrorist groups."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tikrit, the provincial capital of Salauhddin province, 130 kilometres (80 miles) north of Baghdad, fell to ISIS last summer, along with the country's second-largest city of Mosul and other areas in the country's Sunni heartland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tikrit is one of the largest cities held by ISIS militants and lies on the road connecting Baghdad to Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Retaking it will help Iraqi forces have a major supply link for any future operation to retake Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>U.S. military officials have said a co-ordinated military mission to retake Mosul will likely begin in April or May and involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But the Americans have cautioned that if the Iraqis aren't ready, the offensive could be delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Past attempts to retake Tikrit have failed, however, as Iraq struggles with its armed forces, which collapsed in the wake of ISIS's offensive last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Iraqi forces battling near Tikrit also apparently have the help of Iranian Gen. Ghasem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, who arrived there two days ago, the Iranian semi-official Fars news agency reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The powerful general has emerged as the chief tactician in Iraq's fight against the Sunni militants, working on the front lines alongside 120 advisers from his country's Revolutionary Guard to direct Shiite militiamen and government forces in the smallest details of some battles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hours after the offensive began, the U.N. special envoy in Iraq appealed to warring groups to avoid attacking civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Military operations reinforced by international and Iraqi air support must be conducted with the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties, and with full respect for fundamental human rights principles and humanitarian law," Nickolay Mladenov said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tikrit is an important test case for Iraq's Shiite-led government, which is trying to reassert authority over the divided country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>ISIS fighters have a strong presence in the city and are expected to put up fierce resistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The offensive comes as momentum has begun to shift since Iraqi soldiers, backed by airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition, took back the nearby refinery town of Beiji in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Any operation to take Mosul would require Iraq to seize Tikrit first because of its strategic location for military enforcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam, and the Shiite majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Since Saddam was toppled in a U.S.-led invasion in 2003, the Sunni minority has felt increasingly marginalized by the Shiite-led government in Baghdad, and in 2006 long-running tensions boiled over into sectarian violence that claimed tens of thousands of lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>While the TV said Shiite and Sunni tribal fighters were co-operating in Monday's offensive, Tikrit is an important Sunni stronghold, and the presence of Shiite forces risks could prompt a backlash among Sunnis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shiite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Ahead of the operation, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, a Shiite, called on Sunni tribal fighters to abandon ISIS, offering what he described as "the last chance" and promising them a pardon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I call upon those who have been misled or committed a mistake to lay down arms and join their people and security forces in order to liberate their cities," al-Abadi said Sunday during a news conference in Samarra, 95 kilometres (60 miles) north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>His comments appeared to be targeting former members of Iraq's outlawed Baath party, loyalists to Saddam, who joined ISIS during its offensive, as well as other Sunnis who were dissatisfied with Baghdad's Shiite-led government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Saddam, whose Sunni-dominated government ruled the country for some two decades, was executed after his ouster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Tikrit frequently saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country.</td></tr>
