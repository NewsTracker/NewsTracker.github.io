<h3>Cuban Five spy 'awaits next order' from regime as released agents meet Fidel Castro</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The former dictator hosted the group known as the &#x201c;Cuban Five&#x201d; at his home just days after Raul Castro, his brother and successor as president, honoured the men as &#x201c;Heroes of the Republic&#x201d; for their espionage work in the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The agents were released as part of the deal by President Barack Obama and his Cuban counterpart to end five decades of Cold War hostility and restore diplomatic ties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The five anti terrorist heroes, who never did any damage to the United States, were trying to prevent and impede terrorist acts against our people that, it is well known, were organised by US intelligence services," the elder Castro, 88, wrote in an article for Granma, the official daily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is not clear why it took so long for the meeting between the five spies and the father of the Cuban revolution, but the 88-year-old is in poor health and is thought to receive only occasional visitors from outside his inner circle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gerardo Hernandez, the leader of the group, declared his readiness to serve the regime in an interview with Yahoo!</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>News coinciding with the meeting the "historic leader", as the retired Castro is now known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>&#x201c;What I&#x2019;m telling you right now, I already told Raul Castro: I&#x2019;m a soldier,&#x201d; he said, pounding his chest according to the interviewer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready to receive my next order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the official photograph released of the meeting, Mr Castro was wearing one of the tracksuits in which he is invariably pictured after leaving behind the olive military uniform which was his preferred look as president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The five agents were jailed in 1998 and the final three were released on December 17, the day that Mr Obama and his Cuban counterpart Raul announced the plans to end five decades of confrontation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Two others had already returned home after completing their sentences for spying on anti-Castro exiles in Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In return, Havana released Alan Gross, a jailed US aid worker, and former Cuban intelligence agent who spied for the US, as well as 53 political prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The meeting took place on the same weekend that America&#x2019;s historic rapprochement with Cuba was given a celebrity seal of approval when the heiress Paris Hilton visited the hotel her great-grandfather opened in Havana the year before the communist revolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The reality television star even met Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, the son of Fidel Castro, who later nationalised her family&#x2019;s hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>US and Cuban diplomats have been working to agree terms for a re-opening of embassies before Mr Obama and Raul Castro meet at the Summit of Americas in Panama in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Fidel Castro gave tepid support for the talks in a letter read out on state television last month.</td></tr>
