<h3>IMF says Greece confirms it will repay loan due in April</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) " Greece's finance minister on Sunday told the International Monetary Fund chief that his country will repay a substantial loan from the organization that is due this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Yanis Varoufakis met in Washington for an "informal discussion" on the debt-stricken nation's reform program, an IMF statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Greek government has said Varoufakis will meet with U.S. Treasury officials Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece is in difficult negotiations with creditors over its bailout program, which has delayed the disbursement of the final 7.2 billion euro ($7.9 billion) aid tranche.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That has led to a cash crunch, forcing the government to tap reserves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Athens has been hoping for at least a partial release of the final bailout installment in order to avoid default and to pay salaries and pensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We both agreed that effective cooperation is in everyone's interest," Lagarde said in the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We noted that continuing uncertainty is not in Greece's interest."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece must repay a 450 million euro IMF loan installment on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas on Saturday told TV station Mega that Greece has the funds but it is up to the government to decide whether to pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greece and its creditors have been negotiating which reforms it should enact to its economy to receive more funding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lagarde said discussions resume "promptly" on Monday between technical teams and authorities in Athens and in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since 2010, Greece has been dependent on rescue loans worth 240 billion euros from other eurozone countries and the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was elected in January on promises to abolish the deeply resented bailout conditions, which included deep spending cuts and tax hikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, the new Syriza government has since softened many pre-election promises.</td></tr>
