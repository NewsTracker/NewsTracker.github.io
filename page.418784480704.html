<h3>Volcano-like underground fire is put out after a month</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Crews have put out a fire that burned underground in southern New Jersey for a month, melting the ground around it and reaching 1,000 degrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Woodbury Mayor Bill Volk tells the Courier-Post (http://on.cpsj.com/1CVu2fj ) that the fire was extinguished Thursday, a month after it started during a severe storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He says it "looked like a volcano."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It began when a power line snapped, sending electricity into the ground and igniting a mixture of coal and cinder used as the foundation for train tracks in a wooded area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The mayor says neighbors called authorities when they saw smoke coming from the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Firefighters went to the scene seven times over a month before county and state officials helped put it out.</td></tr>
