<h3>Greece's Tsipras defiant ahead of emergency bailout meeting with lead lenders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras insisted Wednesday his government will honor an election promise to end budget austerity - a note of defiance ahead of an expected meeting with the leaders of Germany and France on the country's troubled bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tsipras spoke in parliament before lawmakers approved an anti-poverty bill, the first piece of legislation from the left-wing government elected on Jan. 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tsipras is expected to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on the sidelines of an European Union leaders' meeting Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece is struggling to keep up with a punishing spring debt repayment schedule, but has so far failed to convince rescue lenders to release pending bailout funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The creditors want to first approve a detailed list of reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Let them keep their threats for where they work, not for this government and, more importantly, not for this people," he said at the end of a 30-minute speech to applause from his party's members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The anti-poverty bill - submitted despite objections from rescue creditors - is aimed at providing assistance worth about 200 million euros ($212.7 million) to mostly jobless households considered to be in "extreme poverty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Austerity measures demanded by rescue lenders have focused on reducing debt but in the meantime deepened Greece's recession, causing mass unemployment and financial hardship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece's talks with the rescue creditors are proceeding slowly amid a clash over whether to accept further spending cuts in exchange for more loans - a delay that has further soured relations between Greece and lead lender Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In Berlin, Sigmar Gabriel, the German vice chancellor, said the impasse should not been seen as a bilateral confrontation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This is not about Germany against Greece. It is not about euro countries against Greece," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It is about keeping the eurozone stable together and wanting to do everything to enable Greece to get out of this difficult situation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Although there has been no formal response to Tsipras' request for the emergency meeting with Merkel and Hollande, Greek government spokesman Gavriil Sakellaridis indicated that it would go ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The continued worries over Greece hit share prices on the Athens Stock Exchange, which dropped 4.1 percent Wednesday, continuing a run of losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Unfortunately, in the past 50 days you have lost all the advantages gained by the Greek economy earned from the sacrifices by the Greek people," said Socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos, a former finance minister and deputy premier in previous pro-bailout governments.</td></tr>
