<h3>UMass Amherst, Iranian students spar over admissions, sanctions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The university recently announced its policy and was swiftly criticized by Iranian students and an advocacy group representing Iranian Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The State Department, which oversees visa policies, says that U.S. sanctions against Iran shouldn't be used to bar all Iranian students who want to study science and engineering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The school finds itself dealing with visas, sanctions and educational policy as relations between the United States and Iran have entered another sensitive phase in negotiations over the status of Iran's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The university policy is rooted in one provision in an expansive 2012 federal law that strengthened sanctions against Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The provision denied Iranian citizens education visas to study in the United States if they pursued specialties in in the energy or nuclear fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Feb. 6, UMass Amherst said it would no longer accept Iranian nationals for admission to graduate programs in chemical, computer and mechanical engineering or the natural sciences to avoid any potential violation of U.S. sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Educators say that Amherst's policy is very rare, followed by just a handful of schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Virginia Commonwealth University and Rensselaer Polytechnic University in upstate New York have adopted similar policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Spokespersons for UCLA and the University of California systems said they do not have a policy of limiting such admissions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I think UMass Amherst and any other school that adopts a similar approach is taking an overly broad interpretation of the law," said Erich Ferrari, a lawyer in the Washington-based firm of Ferrari Associates, which specializes in economic sanction law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Such schools are being cautious and "are getting slammed, perhaps unfairly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>UMass officials clarified the school's policy after an Iranian who was doing graduate research was denied reentry to the United States in December as a result of sanctions and related regulations, Michael Malone, vice chancellor for research and engagement at UMass, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said the school didn't want to risk violating the rules because there are significant civil and criminal penalties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Part of the problem is that a student may be admitted by the school and receive a visa, but may later chose a research project that could be a problem, Malone said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After checking with its lawyers, the school decided to act even though banning students is at odds with the school's values of openness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The State Department is committed to facilitating legitimate travel of qualified applicants, said a department official, speaking anonymously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"U.S. law does not prohibit qualified Iranian nationals coming to the United States for education in science and engineering," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Each application is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. We will reach out to UMass Amherst to discuss this specific decision, and are available to answer any questions from other academic institutions regarding implementation of the relevant laws."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Malone says there are 60 to 70 Iranian students in graduate programs at the school, but "just a fraction" are in the sciences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The school receives about 300 applications from Iranian students each year and accepts 20 to 30, but few are in the science research areas that could have sanctions implications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The new policy would have no effect on any current student, Malone said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Nor would it affect Iranian Americans, permanent residents or anyone with dual U.S.-Iran citizenship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The legal advice we got -- and we rely on that -- is that there is no violation of U.S. discrimination laws," Malone said, responding to one of the complaints made by Iranian students on campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We clearly are very frustrated and a lot of people feel betrayed by the university," said Shirin Hakim, former president of the undergraduate Persian Student Assn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>at UMass Amherst and now a spokeswoman for the Iranian Graduate Students Assn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She said she graduated with a public health major last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"It's really shocking and we find it odd since few universities in the United States have such a strict policy," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We were only able to find two other universities that have similar policies," she said, adding that the group would meet with school officials in an effort to have the policy reversed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Though we are very disappointed with this policy, we are all still members of this community -- we are all UMass," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"With this current policy in place, we no longer feel welcome as we did before on this campus."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The National Iranian American Council, which describes itself as a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the interests of the Iranian American community, also urged the school to reverse the policy, calling it a "harmful, discriminatory and unnecessary action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In a letter dated Feb. 13, the Council said the school's policy was apparently based on "a flawed interpretation of U.S. law and may run counter to federal and state protections against discrimination based on national origin."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"We urge the university to revisit its decision and take necessary steps to ensure it is not disenfranchising Iranian and Iranian American students," the group said.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali nine executions: Indonesia's president did not have all the documents when he refused clemency</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Indonesia's President Joko Widodo refused clemency for the Bali nine duo facing execution without all the documentation of their cases due to the chaotic handover to his office from his predecessor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A source familiar with the events, who asked not to be named because of the extreme sensitivity of the case, told Fairfax Media Mr Joko had little more than a list of drug offenders on death row when he made the decisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Abbott spoke with Indonesian president Joko Widodo on Wednesday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Look, the current President simply takes over all pending applications of the death felons from the previous government, which the latter did not touch at all," said the source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"And there was just a few pieces of papers listing names of people on death row. No documents attached to the lists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The source said that the President did not have a complete understanding of the rehabilitation of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, or documentation outlining the testimony from a former governor of Kerobokan prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The governor, Siswanto, testified that their transformation was genuine and had profoundly affected the penitentiary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The two organisers of the Bali nine heroin smuggling ring have run numerous vocational education courses inside Kerobokan, counselled drug addicted inmates and raised money for medical procedures for their fellow convicts and to improve facilities in the prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Joko was sworn in as President in October and refused the clemency of Sukumaran and Chan in December and January respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had failed to consider their clemency for years and, after he left, the complete documentation for the clemency bids was not forwarded to Mr Joko's staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fairfax Media understands the main list of 64 convicts on death row used by Mr Joko contained only the most scant information - names, nationality, ages when they were arrested and sentenced, the status of their legal appeals, and the province in which they are incarcerated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The revelations that Mr Joko had been making his clemency decisions without full information comes as lawyers for the pair prepare an appeal to Jakarta's administrative court arguing the process around the clemency rejection was flawed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They argue that the President rejected all the clemency petitions without reviewing them individually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Without wanting to disrupt the President's prerogative [to granting clemency], we submitted the lawsuit only due to the lack of clarity of reasons behind the President's decision to not grant pardon," said Todung Mulya Lubis, a lawyer for the pair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After the decision on Tuesday to delay the transfer of the pair from Kerobokan to the execution island of Nusakambangan, the families and the duo's lawyers have expressed relief that they have been given more time to press their case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>However, Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments that Indonesia should show mercy because of the $1 billion in aid provided to the country after the devastating 2004 tsunami in Aceh have not gone down well in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Threats are not part of diplomatic language," said foreign affairs spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>" And from what I know, no one responds well to threats."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop said earlier that the postponement of the men's transfer from Bali was a positive sign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"While Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan are still alive, there is always hope," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We are continuing to press the case, just as Indonesia seeks clemency and seeks stays of execution for its nationals who find themselves facing the death penalty overseas."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tim Lindsey, a professor of Asian law at Melbourne University, said the delay suggested the "headlong rush to execute has been interrupted and that is something".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It does represent an opportunity for the government to take a breath about where it goes from here," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He added the situation was becoming more difficult for Indonesia as international criticism mounted over its "blatant double standards" when it came to executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The next time they have a maid facing decapitation in Saudi Arabia and they are seeking to get clemency for her, the government is going to say you haven't shown any similar mercy to those executed in your country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Imagine if someone was decapitated because of that - the government would be hugely criticised."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Professor Lindsey said presidential candidate General Prabowo Subianto got political mileage during last year's election campaign out of Indonesia's blood money payment to spare the life of a maid in Saudi Arabia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"You have two populist policies colliding - execute drug smugglers and save Indonesians overseas. That is unsustainable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A solution, he said, was to adopt the Constitutional Court recommendation that prisoners have their death sentences commuted to life imprisonment if they have been on death row for 10 years and have reformed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Bali nine duo have been on death row for almost 10 years over their role in the foiled attempt to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The head of the Bali correctional facility, the Bali police chief and the head of the Bali paramilitary unit met at Kerobokan prison on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The head of the Bali correctional facility, Nyoman Putra Surya Atmaja, said the police chief wanted to see the location and meet Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He said the brief meeting was "very relaxed" and the Australians didn't ask any questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"They had other things to do like meeting with family, so the meeting was very brief, maybe a minute or two. Andrew was with his family and Myuran was painting," Mr Atmaja said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He said they were ready to hand over the prisoners but the timing was up to the Bali prosecutor's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Meanwhile, the lawyer for Brazilian man Rodrigo Gularte, who was convicted of smuggling 19 kilograms of cocaine in his surfboard in 2004, said the Attorney-General's office would seek a second opinion on whether his client had paranoid schizophrenia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Ricco Akbar hopes Gularte will not be executed because he has been diagnosed with symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"They will get another doctor to examine him and provide a second opinion before they decide what to do with Rodrigo."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He said it was against the law to execute a mentally ill person or a pregnant woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Gularte is one of the nine other prisoners slated to be killed with Chan and Sukumaran in the second round of executions to be held in Indonesia this year.</td></tr>
