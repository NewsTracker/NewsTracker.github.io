<h3>Album review: Courtney Barnett album just an everyday triumph</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit" (Mom & Pop/Marathon Artists/Milk!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>exceeds them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's a great record that doesn't try too hard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Barnett's songs make a virtue of casualness, an off-handedness that can turn razor sharp in the middle of a run-on-sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Somehow, the Australian singer-guitarist has made something fresh out of everyday vignettes performed on everyday instruments (guitar-bass-drums).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She sounds like she's day-dreaming out loud instead of singing, but she's deceptively incisive as a lyricist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Her guitar-playing, while never particularly showy, can be subtle or scalding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Her minimalist style nicely counterpoints the maximalist wordplay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The amiable stomp of "Elevator Operator" creates a template for everything that follows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's a short story spoken as much as sung, packed with descriptive details and too many words to safely cram inside a three-minute song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A 20-year-old blows off work and converses in an elevator with an aging femme fatale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She's worried about why he's heading for the rooftop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I'm not suicidal, just idling insignificantly," he explains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Idling Insignificantly" would've been another great album title, though the one Barnett chose based on a quote attributed to either "Winnie the Pooh" author A.A. Milne or baseball sage Satchel Paige sums up the album's disarmingly wry tone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Like "Elevator Operator," "Pedestrian at Best" turns romantic calamity into a shrug, a deadpan joke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Give me all your money, and I'll make some origami, honey," Barnett sings over fuzzed-up chords and feedback mainlined from Nirvana's "Bleach."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In these songs not much seems to happen the narrator stares at a hotel-room ceiling in "An Illustration of Loneliness (Sleepless in New York)," contemplates the fate of a beached seal in "Kim's Caravan," sizes up her lawn on "Small Poppies," examines the vegetables at the supermarket in "Dead Fox."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>All the action takes place inside the narrator's head, a zone racing with indecision, conflict, feelings of inadequacy and inertia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She's the unassuming hanger-on at the party, the one who notices everything but is never noticed herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She builds modest songs that turn on a telling line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The gently lilting "Depreston" evokes the wide-open spaces of a country song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It describes a couple house-hunting in a suburban cul de sac when they notice "a photo of a young man in a van in Vietnam," and quietly their modest dreams darken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In "Boxing Day Blues," a guitar sounds like it's providing the soundtrack for a hanging, and a couplet encapsulates a dying relationship: "When's the funeral? Do you want me to come?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The turbulence lurking in all these songs bubbles over in the guitar-stoked finales of "Small Poppies" and "Kim's Caravan," the garage-rock rumble of the magnificently tossed off "Nobody Really Cares if You Don't Go to the Party," the forced cheerfulness of the pop bauble "Debbie Downer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Barnett may sometimes act like she's distracted or can't be bothered, but don't be deceived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Her songs refuse to be brushed off.</td></tr>
