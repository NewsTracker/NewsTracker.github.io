<h3>Islamic State creates online 'help desk' for new jihadists</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Beirut: Islamic State and al-Qaeda have formed internet "help desks" to teach jihadists how to avoid being monitored online, a study by the US-based Counter Terrorism Centre has found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Terrorist groups and their supporters use the internet to arrange the movement of foreign fighters around the world and are also teaching recruits techniques for online privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Efforts are also under way to develop their own privacy tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The effectiveness of these tools is likely to be limited in most cases, yet will likely increase the concerns of intelligence and law enforcement individuals as they represent a small first step down the road to developing potential cyber weapons," the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Al-Qaeda and other jihadist organisations have used online discussion forums since the Nineties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Islamic State has taken the practice to a new level, using Twitter and other social media to propagate - and often exaggerate - its conquests.</td></tr>
