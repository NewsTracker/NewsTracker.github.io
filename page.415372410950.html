<h3>NATO chief says Russia still equipping Ukraine rebels</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Asked at a news conference about a U.S. diplomat's remark that Russian tanks had crossed into Ukraine in recent days, he declined specific comment but said: "We ... still see Russian presence and strong support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine. We see the delivery of equipment, forces, training. And so Russia is still in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Therefore we call on Russia to withdraw all its forces from eastern Ukraine and to respect the Minsk agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Tuesday, senior State Department official Victoria Nuland told a U.S. congressional hearing that Russian tanks and artillery had crossed into eastern Ukraine in recent days in breach of a ceasefire deal agreed in Minsk on Feb. 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Stoltenberg and the top NATO commander, U.S. General Philip Breedlove, told reporters at the alliance's military headquarters in Belgium that their priority now in Ukraine was to see monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) given the safe and free access and comprehensive information they needed to reinforce the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Breedlove said NATO could not say if numbers of combatants and weaponry had changed from estimates before the ceasefire because of the difficulties of monitoring movements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was positive that men and equipment had moved back from frontlines, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But we're not sure where they've been moved."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ukraine's government says rebels have been concentrating armaments in depots near the main eastern city of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Stoltenberg said he was concerned that weaponry which was not being monitored could be repositioned for future combat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Our main message today is that the OSCE needs access," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"What we ask for is both freedom of movement ... but also that they get access to necessary information ... The monitoring of ceasefire is by no means sufficient today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Stoltenberg said that despite reports of Ukrainian interest in an international peacekeeping force in the east, no request had been made to NATO and he would not speculate on the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said NATO was "on track" with implementing a plan agreed last September in response to perceived Russian threats to set up a new rapid-reaction force of 5,000 rotating troops backed up by support units in six eastern member states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The alliance is also planning its biggest military exercise in years, involving 25,000 troops, in October and November, although NATO officers said planning had begun before the crisis in Ukraine and it was not specifically aimed at responding to possible Russian action against any of its 28 members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"These measures are defensive, proportionate and in line with our international commitments," Stoltenberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"NATO continues to defend all allies against any threats."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some in the small, ex-Soviet Baltic states have voiced concern that the alliance might hesitate to respond to a Russian incursion on their territory or would struggle to challenge a limited Russian move far from NATO's main bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Among exercises planned, are a beach landing on the Polish Baltic coast in June.</td></tr>

<h3>Parents of Thai ex-princess jailed for insulting monarchy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The well-publicized split of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn and his third wife, former Princess Srirasmi, has been accompanied by a public shaming of a number of her family members, who have been accused of insulting the monarchy, a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Those prosecuted for various offenses include a former senior police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The court found Srirasmi's parents, Wantanee Suwadee, 66, and Apiruj Suwadee, 72, had misused the crown prince's name during a dispute in 2003 with a neighbor who was then prosecuted on a bogus fraud charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When earlier presented with the charges against them, the pair announced they did not want to use a lawyer and pleaded guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The court has examined the surrounding witnesses and evidence, together with the plea, and decided that both defendants were guilty as charged," the judge said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The accused confessed to the charges and as a result their sentence is reduced to two years and six months each without suspension."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Guilty pleas in Thai courts traditionally result in more lenient sentencing, typically a halving of prison time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Acquittals are rare in cases of insulting the monarchy " called lese majeste " which is regarded as a socially abhorrent crime, though prosecutions sometimes appear to be politically motivated.</td></tr>
