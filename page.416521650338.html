<h3>Baltimore Marchers Stage 'Die-In' Proesting Police-Custody Death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake says she is "profoundly disappointed" that the protests over the death of Freddie Gray turned violent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Our city has a long history of peaceful demonstrations," Rawlings-Blake said Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Ninety-five percent or more of the people who came out sought to protest in that spirit. Unfortunately a small group of agitators turned what was otherwise a peaceful demonstration into a violent protest."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At least 12 people were arrested and two were injured in the mayhem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fire officials estimate that roughly 1,200 people gathered at City Hall earlier in the day, and one person was transported to the hospital after falling down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gray suffered a spinal injury while in police custody and later died at a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Protesters have been angry, gathering for near-daily demonstrations since Gray died about a week ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Freddie Gray's twin sister is appealing to protesters to "please, please stop the violence" after a small group of demonstrators smashed out storefronts and police cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was the first public comments from Gray's sister, Fredricka Gray, since he suffered an unexplained spinal injury in police custody and died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fredericka Gray appeared with the mayor at a news conference and said her brother would not want to see the kind of violence that occurred in Baltimore on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At least two people were injured and a dozen were arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Fans at the Orioles-Red Sox baseball game were told to stay in the stadium because of public safety worries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Police have cleared Freddie Gray protesters of an intersection near the Baltimore Orioles game, allowing traffic to once again start flowing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The demonstrators split off from the main rally Saturday, which drew thousands of people upset over the police-custody death of Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The number of what police called "agitators" are dwindling downtown, as a line of officers continue to push protesters away from the intersection they'd blocked traffic for hours.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>Malik Shabazz, the president of Black Lawyers for Justice, said the crowd exceeded their expectations and included Gray's family, Baltimore residents and people from the national anti-police brutality movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Asked about the second, more volatile portion of the demonstrations, he said protesters' anger is not a shock.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>The Baltimore police commissioner says he believes looters and other people causing trouble during a Freddie Gray protest are not from the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Commissioner Anthony Batts tells The Associated Press that Batts said there have been 12 arrests, and crimes include two armed robberies, several assaults and looting of a convenience store.</td></tr>
