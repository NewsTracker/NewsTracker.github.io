<h3>Mali: Gunmen attack village near Ivory Coast border</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BAMAKO, Mali (AP) - Gunmen identifying as Islamic extremists attacked and briefly occupied a village in southern Mali near Ivory Coast on Sunday before security forces drove them out, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attack was the second to be perpetrated in Mali's southern half over the weekend by suspected Islamic extremists, and President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita convened a meeting of defense officials in the capital, Bamako, on Sunday to discuss the security situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sunday's attack targeted the village of Fakola, 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of the Ivory Coast border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Armed individuals identifying as jihadists today attacked the village of Fakola. They came on motorcycles," said Mamadou Tangara, mayor of the regional capital Sikasso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The attackers carried "a black flag of jihadists" and shouted "Allahu Akbar," or "God is great" in Arabic, said a military police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They burned administrative buildings as well as a building that was being used as a local base for military police, though the military police sustained no casualties because they had left the village before the attack began, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The official said he spoke to residents before the assailants cut the phone network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Casualty information and details on the identity of the attackers were not immediately available Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Security forces stationed nearby were dispatched to drive the attackers out, and by late afternoon they had retaken control of Fakola, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Islamic extremists took control of northern Mali in 2012 following a military coup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A French-led military intervention in 2013 scattered them from the north's cities and towns, though the north remains insecure and in recent months violence has extended further south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In March a masked gunman opened fire in a restaurant popular with foreigners in Bamako, killing five people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Three soldiers were killed Saturday when suspected extremists attacked the village of Nara about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of the border with Mauritania.</td></tr>
