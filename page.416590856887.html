<h3>Dow, S&P 500 end up with Merck, IBM; Nasdaq slips with Apple</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 ended a volatile session higher on Tuesday, helped by strong earnings from Merck and gains in IBM after it boosted its dividend, while the Nasdaq fell with Apple.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>The stock hit a record high in early trading but shares ended down 1.6 percent at $130.56, weighing on the Nasdaq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There continues to be the bull-bear push, even with the good numbers you saw from Merck," and other companies, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Apple's numbers were phenomenal, but yet the stock is down," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I think people were expecting a blowout quarter ... so it's kind of a sell-the-news situation."</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>Whirlpool (WHR.N) fell 7.1 percent to $183.70, the biggest percentage decliner in the S&P 500, after the company cut its 2015 profit and sales forecast, blaming the strong dollar and Brazil's stagnating economy.</td></tr>
