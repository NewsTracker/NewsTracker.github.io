<h3>Facebook Changes News Feed Algorithm To Prioritize Content From Friends Over Pages</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook product manager Max Eulenstein and user experience researcher Lauren Scissors announced that the News Feed has been updated to show you content that matters to you the most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eulenstein and Scissors said that the News Feed will give you a balanced mix of updates from friends and public figures, publishers, businesses and community organizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, the balance will be different for everyone depending on what people are interested in learning every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>How will this affect your Facebook Pages?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Facebook said that the distribution will vary depending on your audience and posting activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For example, the post reach and referral traffic may decline if there are limited interactions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook Pages should continue to post content that the audience finds "meaningful" based on Facebook's best practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Fortunately for brands, Facebook said that referral traffic to media publishers have more than doubled in the past 18 months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We're always looking for ways to optimize how content is discovered and consumed. Media content is a key part of the experience for people on Facebook and we're committed to helping publishers find the right audience for their content," said Facebook in a news post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>To prevent spam from spreading, Facebook started to demote content with "click-bait" headlines last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Click-baiting is when a publisher posts links with headlines that encourages people to click on the content without offering much information about what the user will view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>About a month later, Facebook said that it will be surfacing timely stories to the top of the News Feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>After those changes were implemented, several publishers complained about a drop in organic reach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Facebook chief executive officer and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg hosted the company's first town hall question-and-answer session in November 2014, which is when he was asked why Facebook Pages were seeing a decrease in organic traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Zuckerberg said "as time goes on, people are just sharing more things on Facebook. So each person who is consuming content in their News Feed - they might read 100 stories from their friends and Pages a day. And as their friends share more content and as they follow more Pages and as those Pages share more content, there's just more competition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At that time, an average of 1,500 stories were floating through the News Feed of each user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Each user is seeing an average of about 100 of those stories per day, which are controlled by engagement algorithms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Only the highest quality content appears at the top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Facebook has over 1.4 billion users so publishers largely depend on the referral traffic from the social network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Facebook is also the primary source of news consumption for younger audiences, which is why publishers are forced to adapt to News Feed changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Facebook generates a majority of its revenue through advertising, which includes sponsored posts from brands that want to receive additional traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Ultimately, Facebook's users control what they want to see on their News Feed by adding friends, "liking" Pages and engaging with the content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>What are your thoughts about Facebook choosing to show more content from your friends towards the top of the News Feed?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Let us know in the comments section!</td></tr>
