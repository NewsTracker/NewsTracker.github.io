<h3>Mohamed El-Erian: Grexit 'high probability'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There's a "high probability" of a Greece exit from the euro zone, Mohamed El-Erian said Monday, a day after Greek voters rejected the bailout terms of creditors in a national referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The economy there is grinding to a halt, said El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Germany's financial services giant Allianz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"What's happening on the ground means the situation is slipping out of the control of the politicians. I don't think that's being factored in enough."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a surprise move, Yanis Varoufakis, the fiery Greek finance minister, resigned on Monday, in what's seen as a concession to lenders despite his anti-austerity victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Varoufakis said he wanted to give Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras a "fresh start" in reforms talks, which could decide whether Greece stays in the single euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The euro zone controls its own destiny. The euro zone has instruments to limit contagion. They haven't been deployed yet," said El-Erian, former co-CEO of Pimco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Should there be a Grexit, he said, "I'm not worried about the economic contagion. I'm not worried about the financial contagion. What I am worried about is ... the shock to risk appetite."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The notion of a Greek "sabbatical" from the euro-a temporary reversion to a local currency until the economy stabilizes-is a tougher sell now than it was a few years ago, said El-Erian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Harvard professor Marty Feldstein, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan, told CNBC he supports a Greek "leave of absence" from the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Under this scenario, "they're not being thrown out of the euro zone; certainly they are not being denied the privileges [and] the rights of being a member of the European Union, the trading rights and the labor market rights," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier, Ewald Nowotny, a member of the European Central Bank's governing council, told CNBC the euro nations all have an interest in keeping Greece in the single currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"But of course, we know this means that a number of actions have to be taken," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Tomorrow will be an EU summit," where Greece's application for a new bailout will be discussed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When asked about whether he's optimistic that Greece can remain in the euro, the Austrian central bank governor told CNBC's " Squawk Box " that it's not a matter of being optimistic, but a matter of being "realistic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Nowotny said Varoufakis' resignation won't help or hurt the negotiations because the issues are not about personalities but about economic conditions, which haven't changed since Sunday's vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The ECB was set to decide on further emergency funding for Greek banks, which have been closed now for a week under capital controls designed to prevent a banking system collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"What we have to look at what is our room to maneuver according to the legal situation we are in," said Nowotny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I think this has to be clearly distinguished from the political aspect that has to be dealt with by the heads of state and the finance ministers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Thomas Wieser, president of the Euro Working Group, which prepares decisions at meetings of the euro zone's finance ministers, said the situation in Greece is deteriorating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A quick solution that Tsipras promised voters is "not very realistic," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This is clear, the clock is ticking," Wieser told CNBC Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Ten days ago, Greece was a country with banks open and a certain degree of confidence that they would get a further bailout commitment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"[But] as we are speaking today, the tourism season looks bad, the financial sector is closed down ... with capital controls. We need to move, and I think the Greece side needs to move as fast as possible," Wieser continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"There will be very, very difficult discussions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>James Galbraith-professor at the University of Texas at Austin and friend of Varoufakis-told CNBC: "The elements of a reasonable deal are spelled out. They were there on Wednesday in a letter from the prime minister to the European partners."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"If the governments of Europe choose to break up the euro zone on their own, that will be on their responsibility," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"But it is not something which either the Greek government or the Greek people want."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The leftist Greek government is committed to long-term structural reforms, including improving the tax system, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"But what the creditors have been asking for are flat cuts in pensions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Greece has already endured more austerity than any other country in the euro zone, Galbraith said, which resulted in a 25 percent decline in economic growth, "These supposedly pro-growth reforms ... have produced the exact opposite, a gigantic depression."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>James Galbraith's father was the famous economist, John Kenneth Galbraith.</td></tr>
