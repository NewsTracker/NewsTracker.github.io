<h3>2 Brotherhood leaders held in Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two leaders of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood have been arrested by Egyptian authorities after two years on the run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The arrests are part of a massive government crackdown on the 87-year-old organisation which was launched after the military ousted former president Mohammed Morsi in July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Morsi, a member of the Brotherhood, was overthrown after millions staged demonstrations demanding he step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He is awaiting a court's confirmation of his death sentence today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The two detained leaders are Abdel-Rahman el-Bar, the group's top religious cleric, and Mahmoud Ghozlan, the Brotherhood's former spokesman and a member of its top decision-making body, an official said, adding that they were hiding in a suburb of Giza when they were arrested yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Brotherhood spokesman Mohammed Montassir described the arrests on his Facebook page as a "failed attempt by the brutal coup authorities to disrupt the revolutionaries across the nation".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He added that the Egyptian government would fail to "terrorise" the Brotherhood and vowed: "We are on our path steadfast until achieving freedom and dignity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Once the country's most influential political group, dozens of Brotherhood leaders have been put on trial, with many receiving death sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Today, a court is expected to look into Morsi's death sentence in connection with a mass prison break during Egypt's 2011 uprising that eventually brought him to power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On May 16, a court sentenced Morsi to death and referred the case to Egypt's top Muslim cleric for a consultative opinion - a normal step for all death sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Today's hearing will consider the response from Grand Mufti Shawki Allam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The crackdown on the Brotherhood ignited divisions within the group's highly disciplined ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A younger generation is pushing for more violent and confrontational tactics, analysts say, while the older generation - at least in their official announcements - is insisting on "peaceful means" of resistance.</td></tr>
