<h3>AP PHOTOS: Egypt's banned ultras soccer fans take to streets</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Chanting slogans, carrying signs and waving flares, these eager young men who gather in Egypt could be mistaken for Arab Spring demonstrators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And in this country, the recently-banned hardcore soccer fans known as ultras have played a political role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ultras, whose name comes from the Latin word for "beyond," started in Latin America and Europe in the 1950s before coming to Arab countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The first to form in Egypt, Ultras White Knights, emerged in 2007 to support the Zamalek team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Groups backing archrival al-Ahly and others followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Security forces and the media criticize ultras as being little more than violence-prone thugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was during Egypt's 2011 revolt that ousted longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak that ultras first took on a political role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Often providing muscle at protests, ultras also directed demonstrators and led chants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They were considered one of the most organized movements in Egypt after the Muslim Brotherhood, which the government outlawed as a terrorist organization following the 2013 military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since 2011, ultras have clashed frequently with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 2012, a soccer riot involving ultras killed more than 70 people and injured hundreds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In May, a Cairo court banned them over terrorism accusations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The case was filed by Mortada Mansour, the head of Zamalek who has long been at odds with his team's own ultras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>White Knights leader Sayed Moshagheb is in jail on incitement charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Observers have said Egypt's ultras see themselves as offering marginalized youth a chance to vent pent-up frustration through peaceful protests, as opposed to apathy or violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Here are a series of Associated Press photographs of Egypt's hardcore soccer fans known as ultras.</td></tr>
