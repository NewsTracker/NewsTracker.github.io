<h3>The Latest: Baltimore Police Officers Face Hearing May 27</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The six Baltimore police officers charged in Freddie Gray's death are scheduled to appear in court at the end of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lt. Brian Rice, Sgt. Alicia White, and officers Caesar Goodson, Garrett Miller, Edward Nero and William Porter have a preliminary hearing together on May 27 in Baltimore District Court, according to online court records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If the judge finds there is probable cause to support the charges, the case will move to circuit court to begin preparations for trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Defendants can, and often do, waive preliminary hearings and the case is transferred to circuit court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Also, a prosecutor can seek an indictment from a grand jury, which would make a preliminary hearing unnecessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Demonstrators hold a moment of silence at the intersection of Pennsylvania and North avenues in Baltimore for Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died after being seriously injured while in police custody last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The moment of silence comes as Baltimore braces for a mass demonstration and rally in memory of Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Six police officers were charged Friday with felonies ranging from assault to murder in Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In announcing the charges, State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said police had no reason to stop or chase Gray in the first place when they confronted him on April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He died of injuries on April 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Heavily armed police and National Guard troops are making a show of force at key intersections and government buildings in Baltimore in preparation for Saturday's mass protest marches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Barricades have been erected to block vehicle traffic from the blocks around City Hall, the destination of the largest planned march.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Armored military vehicles were parked at the checkpoints, and there were large numbers of police and troops donning body armor, many carrying assault rifles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The marches were called earlier this week to protest the death of Freddie Gray, a black man injured while in police custody April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But after the arrest of six Baltimore police officers in the case on Friday, the mood of Saturday's marches are expected to be more celebratory than tense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Police spokesman Sgt. Jarron Jackson says there were 38 protest-related arrests and 15 curfew-violation arrests Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Demonstrators took to the streets Friday to celebrate the announcement that six police officers were being charged in the death of Freddie Gray, who died of a spinal injury received while in police custody earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A group of about 15 protesters marched through the downtown streets chanting "No justice, no peace" - to nobody in particular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Police vans and armored National Guard vehicles drove by the group, but took no action, despite the protesters' clear defiance of a 10 p.m. curfew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A line of National Guard troops and tanks is at Baltimore City Hall, along with a large crowd of members of the media and a line of police wearing helmets and carrying body shields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mounted police are also guarding the area and police vans are on the scene.</td></tr>
