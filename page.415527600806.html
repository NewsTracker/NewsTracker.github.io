<h3>Penn State frat suspended over Facebook page with nude pics of sleeping, passed-out women</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- A Penn State University fraternity was suspended for a year Tuesday after police began investigating allegations that members used a private, invitation-only Facebook page to post photos of nude and partly nude women, some apparently asleep or passed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A former member of Kappa Delta Rho at the university's flagship campus in State College tipped police off to the page, telling them in January that it had been used by members to share photos of "unsuspecting victims, drug sales and hazing," according to a copy of a police warrant obtained by The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The ex-member also provided authorities with printouts from the page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The fraternity's national executive director, Joe Rosenberg, told the Penn State chapter in a letter that it would be banned from most activities for the near future and must reorganize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said the suspension was "for the most serious misconduct, most serious disregard of fraternity rules."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chapter officials, who can appeal the decision, did not respond to messages seeking comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A young man who answered the door Tuesday afternoon declined to identify himself and said the fraternity had no comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A Penn State administrator called the allegations a violation of the standards and values required for recognized student organizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent" with the university's expectations, Damon Sims, Penn State's vice president for student affairs, said in a news release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sims said the school would find those responsible and hold them accountable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police said anyone who posted the photos could face misdemeanor charges of harassment or invasion of privacy, with a fine being the most likely penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>State College police said they first fielded the complaint on Jan. 18 and reported the matter to university administrators on March 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The informant's computer "yielded information on two victims whose images would rise to the level of criminal action," State College police Lt. Keith Robb said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Facebook was contacted to disable the site and to obtain more information for the investigation, Robb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some of the postings involved nude women in "sexual or embarrassing positions," the warrant reads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It appears from the photos provided that the individuals in the photos are not aware that the photos had been taken."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Penn State's Interfraternity Council planned a full review of Kappa Delta Rho's conduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>According to the ex-fraternity member who went to police, a second page dubbed "2.0" was started in about April 2014 after a woman depicted on the first Facebook page, called "Covert Business Transactions," complained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The informant said the woman was visiting the fraternity when a member accidentally left his Facebook page logged in, and she noticed a topless photograph of her had been posted to the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Robb told the AP she wanted the photo removed but did not wish to press charges.</td></tr>

<h3>U.S. influence challenged in global financial institutions -Lew</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration warned on Tuesday that rising powers were challenging U.S. leadership in global financial institutions, and urged Congress to approve a deal it says would help preserve U.S. influence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"New players are challenging U.S. leadership in the multilateral system," Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told U.S. lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lew's comments came after Germany, France and Italy said they had agreed to join a new China-led Asian investment bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Britain also defied U.S. pressure not to join the venture, which Washington sees as a rival to the World Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The United States is struggling with political gridlock and long-term fiscal challenges at a time when China looks set to eventually eclipse America as the world's largest economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lew urged the lawmakers to sign off on a reform of the International Monetary Fund that would give emerging markets a bigger say in global economic policy while also preserving U.S. veto power in the institution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The United States and other countries agreed to a deal in 2010, but the U.S. Congress has yet to approve it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lew said that "is causing other countries, including some of our allies, to question our commitment to the IMF and other multilateral institutions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our international credibility and influence are being threatened," he said.</td></tr>
