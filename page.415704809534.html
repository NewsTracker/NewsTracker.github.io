<h3>11 million fewer uninsured since Obamacare</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday the figure would still leave about 37 million people uninsured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to two reports issued by the centres, the most dramatic change in the numbers took place during the first nine months of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As the law's major coverage expansion was taking effect, the number of uninsured fell by 7.6 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Monday was the law's fifth anniversary and supporters and detractors again clashed over its impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Obama said the law in many ways was "working even better than anticipated", while House Speaker John Boehner said it amounted to a "legacy of broken promises".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>House Republicans filed a lawsuit against the signature health care law and unilateral actions in November, citing a broad and systematic overreach of executive authority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi dismissed what she described as a "meritless" action, claiming it was the work of "impeachment-hungry extremists".</td></tr>
