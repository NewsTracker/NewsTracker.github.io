<h3>In quake-hit Nepal, rescue workers struggle to recover the dead as toll climbs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal - For hours after Nepal was shaken by one of the most intense earthquakes here in nearly a century, 12-year-old Neha Chumda screamed for help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She had been inside her family's four-story villa in Kathmandu when the tremor struck unexpectedly Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And in the life-or-death seconds that followed - when her home swayed at its walls began cracking apart - she and 11 members of her family rushed to get outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They all made it - except Neha, who was pinned in a room between the second and third floors, which had collapsed onto of each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"She was crying for so long, we tried to help her," Transport Minister Tek Bahadur Garung said of the girl, who is the daughter of one of his cousins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The cries turned faint, then ceased by the time Nepalese army troops and security forces began trying to break through the front of the house to pry Neha out at 4 p.m. Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Then for a day and a half the soldiers used hammers, crowbars, shovels and a generator-powered saw and small jack-hammer to tear open the front of the house, then bust through the ceiling into the second floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By Monday morning, they could see Neha's lifeless body curled up, covered in dust, a single elbow poking out above them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Then, at 10 a.m. - 42 hours after the rescue operation began - they finally pulled her out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They lowered her gently into a rainbow colored blanket that served as a makeshift stretcher, then placed her on the grassy ground outside, where four members of her family wept, their red-eyes filled with tears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We have manpower. But we don't have nearly enough equipment to do the job," Garung said of his government's rescue efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We need help from every country that will give it. We need bulldozers, cranes, scaffolding, machinery."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Speaking outside the girl's home in a black tracksuit, with dozens of distraught residents looking on, Garung said: "There are a lot of dead bodies here and it's very difficult to get them out. We can't do it with crowbars" alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The estimated death toll from Nepal's earthquake soared past 4,000, and could go much higher if it turns out that vulnerable mountain villages - where information is still scarce and rescue workers are still struggling to reach - were hit hard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The catastrophe has overwhelmed Nepal's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Garung said the Cabinet was meeting daily, but "we don't know what to do in such a situation ... this is very hard. It's a big problem. It's a mess."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although the vast majority of Kathmandu's five and 10-story buildings actually withstood the quake and still stand, many have been damaged and it's unclear whether they are still safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On the four-lane road that runs up a hill near Neha's home, most buildings looked undamaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But half a dozen were in ruins and several multi-story apartment blocks were tilting precariously, one at a 60-degree angle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Many people have camped outdoors in the chilly night cold since the quake, some in tent cities in grass parks where thousands have congregated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tens of thousands more squat on sidewalks and roads - anywhere but their own houses - fearing aftershocks that have shaken Nepal repeatedly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At one of the city's international hotels, foreign guests have done the same, dragging bed-sheets and pillows into gardens outside and sleeping on lounge chairs by the pool.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>For many, uncertainty reigns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It is unclear what is happening and when help might be on the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Power lines are down, cell phone connections are sporadic at best, and most shops and banks are closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Long lines have also formed at gas stations as critical fuel supplies run low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Just behind Neha's villa, another much larger operation to recover bodies was underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Nepalese troops and Indian emergency rescue crews were scaling part of a green, three-story building with orange columns that had been destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Authorities estimated a couple dozen people died inside the structure, most of them were Christians attending a church meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>P.B. Bista, a police officer in the area, said 13 bodies had been recovered since the previous day, and six had been pulled from the rubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>On the ground outside, the emergency workers brought a shattered wooden donation box filled with Nepalese rupees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The words "Youth Gospel" and "Luke 6:38" were written across its top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Beside it sat a black-bound Hindi language bible covered in dirt and a plastic bag of yellow biscuits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Nepal is an overwhelmingly Hindu nation and has a small Christian population who comprise 1.4 percent of the country's 27 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Amir Amang, who worked at the church, which was on the second floor, said one of those rescued had been saved after midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But he said four of his family members had been found and taken to a morgue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He said they were a niece, a sister, and two aunts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>His father was still missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"I am shattered. I'm getting very emotional," he said, before waving his hand to indicate he could no longer speak, and walking away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>As he spoke, rescue workers brought down body after body - seven in the space of one hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>When the first man came on a yellow plastic stretcher, wrapped in a curtain with yellow and blue flowers, his brother began sobbing, putting his palms across his eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The dead man was face down, one of his fists still tightly clenched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He was placed, like the rest, on a plastic Pepsi advertisement torn from the building's wreckage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Navraj Bhatta said the victim was a 25-year-old relative, a high-school science teacher named Rajendra Bhatta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>He said the man had just eaten at a second-floor restaurant called Daniel's Cafe with one of Bhatta's relatives when the quake hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The two were on the way out, but the teacher stopped to go to the bathroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"He never came out," Navraj said forlornly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Navraj said the family would take Rajendra's body to Hindu temple where he would be burned on a pyre by the Bagmati River.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>But he said there were long lines there and he was unable to say when it could happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Navraj said Rajendra might have survived if the city's notoriously lax building codes were enforced.</td></tr>
