<h3>Sharks beat Maple Leafs 4-1</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But they didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>San Jose came through with its strongest offensive showing in more than two weeks, got solid bounce-back goaltending from Antti Niemi and skated off with a 4-1 victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Sharks probably can reach the postseason even if they drop one or two more games, but losing to the Maple Leafs likely would have been devastating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Still, don't suggest that the victory was any less significant because of the opponent, which now has only one win in its past eight games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They're playing just to play so they're going to be loose, they're going to play hard. We weren't looking past this game by any means," forward Joe Pavelski said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was important that the guys were as focused as they were and handled the situation well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tomas Hertl, Logan Couture, Melker Karlsson and Tommy Wingels scored for the Sharks, and Leafs defenseman Jake Gardiner's shot was the only one to get past Niemi, who made 27 saves two days after being yanked in the first period of a 5-2 loss at Winnipeg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The win narrowed the gap between the Sharks and third place in the Pacific Division, which carries an automatic playoff berth, from six points to five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But San Jose gained no ground in the wild-card competition and remains six behind in that race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Sharks got on the board at 7:02 of the first period when Chris Tierney sent the puck to Hertl slicing through the slot for a quick redirect that Leafs goalie Jonathan Bernier had no chance to stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I thought I had some time and I saw him going to the net, so I thought I'd just get it to him and he made a great play," said Tierney, who was centering the second line for the first time this season after coach Todd McLellan shuffled his forwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tierney, who centered Hertl and Patrick Marleau, ended up with a season-high 19:06 in ice time, while Couture, who was dropped to the third line, had 15:40 skating between Wingels and Matt Nieto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>McLellan said before the game he was seeking improvement on both ends of the ice after the Sharks allowed 11 goals in the previous two games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And though each of the new lines produced a goal, it was their play in their own zone that pleased him most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They were good defensively," the coach said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The goals, we hoped would come over time, but it was giving up five a night ... we weren't going to win that way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Sharks broke it open in the second period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A power-play goal by Couture -- his first of any kind in six games -- gave San Jose a 2-0 lead at 2:06, but Toronto narrowed the gap again at 8:54 when defenseman Gardiner's shot through traffic floated over Niemi's shoulder into the far top corner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But San Jose restored the lead to two goals when Karlsson slipped into some open space to take a Joe Thornton pass -- a milestone 900th assist -- and fired the puck past Bernier at 10:19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And Wingels deflected a shot by Nieto with just six seconds left before the second intermission to make it 4-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The victory evened the Sharks record at 1-1 on their seven-game trip that continues with a Saturday night game against the Montreal Canadiens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But the Sharks know many more need to follow with only 11 games left in the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Now we need to build on this win," Couture said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We're going into a tough building to win in Saturday. It's going to be an exciting game for us. Build off this one, move forward."</td></tr>

<h3>Thousands wait for relief in Vanuatu as death toll inches up</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thousands wait for relief in Vanuatu as death toll inches up Thousands of people left homeless by a fierce cyclone remained stuck in shelters across Vanuatu on Friday as the death toll from the disaster rose by two to 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Women wash clothes Thursday, March 19, 2015, on Tanna Island, Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>TANNA ISLAND, Vanuatu (AP) - Thousands of people left homeless by a fierce cyclone remained stuck in shelters across Vanuatu on Friday, waiting for relief and longing for a return to normalcy as the death toll from the disaster rose by two to 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Australian and French troops arrived on the South Pacific nation's hard-hit island of Tanna, where shaken residents were still waiting for help after their villages were flattened by Cyclone Pam's 270 kilometer (168 mile) per hour winds last Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing figures from Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, upgraded the number of confirmed deaths to 13 from 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Among the dead were seven people from Tafea Province, which includes Tanna, and six from Shefa Province, which includes the main island of Efate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, given the immense power of the storm, the relatively low death toll is a testament to the residents' experience in dealing with cyclones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In many villages, people found shelter in special structures built with sturdy walls that can withstand heavy winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Vanuatu's government authorized the distribution of emergency food and water supplies to affected areas, but was still waiting to finish its damage assessment report before beginning a wider distribution of relief items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Some relief supplies have been starting to get there anyway, but the more organized and the larger relief efforts will start tomorrow," said Osnat Lubrani, the U.N.'s Humanitarian Coordinator for Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The relief has to start coming now, because if it doesn't come in the next two days or so, then we will have problems with food and with water."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Vanuatu is a nation of subsistence farmers, and many people depend on the food they grow to survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The cyclone wiped out gardens, killed livestock and contaminated the water supply in many areas, and agricultural experts estimate that those displaced by the storm will run out of food in less than a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Vanuatu government needs at least $2 million in financial aid to buy supplies and ship them to the worst-hit islands, the U.N. said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The government was asking for donations of enough biscuits, rice and canned protein to help keep islanders' fed through June, when newly-planted crops will be ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A barge carrying food, water and shelter materials arrived on Tanna on Friday and the supplies were being taken to the island's main hospital, said Tom Perry, spokesman for CARE Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two assessment teams were also planning to reach remote sections of the island on Friday that were reported to have been decimated, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The storm turned Tanna's lush tropical forests into a jumble of broken trunks and strewn branches, and damaged or destroyed at least 80 percent of homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Critically, it also broke water pipes and decimated vegetable patches, cutting off food and water sources for most of the island's 30,000 residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On the eastern side of the island near the belching volcano Yasur, people say the problems are compounded by volcanic ash that the winds spread everywhere, killing the plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tanna resident Patrick George has spent days running around trying to find water, and trudging into the wilderness to collect fallen coconuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The storm destroyed his crops, including bananas and a local variety of potato, and he worries about how he will feed his family when the coconuts run out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Meanwhile, the ash from the volcano has started to make the children cough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Joseph Kamisak, tourism minister for the island's Eastern Province, said many water pipes were broken and the water systems were filled with wood and debris from the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The storm also destroyed many schools in the worst-hit areas, while others are being used as shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Albert Kaukare, principal at Iquaramanu Primary School on Tanna, said people were still sheltering in his school, preventing the students from returning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The cyclone had also ruined the students' supplies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We would like to start but some of our textbooks have all got wet, and everything damaged," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"At the end of this year, the year six students will be sitting exams, and it's important because this will determine whether they move on or they remain. So it's very important that they must start school."</td></tr>
