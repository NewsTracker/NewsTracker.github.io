<tr><td>2</td><td>At issue in the case King v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Burwell is the Affordable Care Act's health insurance subsidies, which help millions of Americans afford health coverage.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Here's a map that shows how dire things are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For the 13 states and Washington D.C. that have established their own state-run marketplaces, nothing will change as a result of the ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Residents of the 37 remaining states stand to lose their health insurance.</td></tr>
