<h3>Greek Campaigns, Neck and Neck, Reach Dramatic Finale</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greeks packed city squares for dueling rallies late into the night Friday, as polls showed a dead heat between the 'yes' and 'no' camps ahead of a bailout referendum Sunday that could be Greece's most important vote since it joined the European Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>More than 40,000 people gathered at the two rallies, half a mile (800 meters) apart, before Sunday's vote on whether to accept creditors' proposals for more austerity in exchange for rescue loans, or reject the deal as a show of defiance against years of harsh economic austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"This is not a protest. It is a celebration to overcome fear and blackmail," Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told a crowd of 25,000 in front of parliament, who were chanting "oxi, oxi" - "no, no."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tsipras angered Greece's creditors by calling the referendum and is urging Greeks to vote no.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Meanwhile, police said about 17,000 people gathered outside the nearby Panathenian stadium for the "yes" rally, waving Greek and European Union flags and chanting "Greece, Europe, Democracy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rallies for both campaigns were also held in 10 other Greek cities Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tsipras is gambling the future of his five-month-old left wing government on Sunday's snap poll - insisting a "no" vote will strengthen his hand to negotiate a third bailout with better terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the high-stakes standoff with lenders this week saw Greece default on debts, close banks to avoid their collapse, and lose access to billions of euros as an existing bailout deal expired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At the "no" rally, Athens resident Maria Antiniou held a handmade sign, reading "oxi."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We have to strengthen Tsipras. It's not his fault we are bankrupt," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He doesn't have the mandate to take tougher measures and now we are giving that to him. It's not true this is a vote on the euro. It's a vote to change course and stay in the euro, and Tsipras is our best hope," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That is a message the "yes" voters refuse believe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Evgenia Bouzala, a Greek born in Germany, said she was considering shutting down her olive oil export business because of the financial turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"A 'yes' vote would bring a caretaker government and that would probably be better ... We have to start over."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The country's top court stayed in session till the late afternoon before rejecting a petition to declare the referendum illegal, while party leaders, personalities, and church elders weighed in with impassioned pleas to vote "no" or "yes" on the airwaves and social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In a rare public declaration, 16 former armed forces leaders wrote an appeal to citizens to show "calm and national unity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A series of polls published Friday at the end of a frantic weeklong campaign showed the two sides in a dead heat, with an incremental lead of the "yes" vote well within the margin of error.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But they showed an overwhelming majority of people - about 75 percent - want Greece to remain in the euro currency.</td></tr>
