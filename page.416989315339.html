<h3>Tamir Rice cremated after he was killed by Cleveland police officer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The body of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot dead by police at a Cleveland playground six months ago, has been cremated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tamir Rice's mother made the decision last week, family attorney Walter Madison says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tamir had an airsoft gun that shoots nonlethal plastic pellets when a rookie officer fatally shot him on November 22, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Timothy Loehmann, the officer who shot Rice, and Frank Garmback, who was driving the police squad car, are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rice was black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The incident was one of a series of killings of black people by white police officers that fueled national outrage over the use of force by law enforcement officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rice, a sixth-grader, was playing with a replica handgun that mainly shoots plastic pellets when he was shot twice by police responding to a 911 emergency call about a man with a gun outside a recreation center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rice died the next day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A security camera video of the shooting shows Loehmann shooting Rice less than two seconds after the two officers' squad car arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The officer had no way of knowing Tamir wasn't carrying a real firearm, a police union official says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Madison has sued the city, and says in a legal case Tamir's cause of death would be an issue and there was concern there may need to be independent examination of his body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Madison told The Daily Kos 'Samaria is a mother first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'Whether or in life or death, her instinct is to care for her child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'Due to an unfortunate turn of events she was faced with the unspeakable decision to finally put her son to final rest or endure this legal morass and its hardness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'After the tremendous amount of support from around the world, Samaria made the grief stricken decision to be a mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The court filing also reportedly cited fears of missing evidence and said the lawsuit will not be stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The filing came after a city request the Rice family put the lawsuit on hold as long as the probe is going on, the Post reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Cuyahoga County Sheriff Cliff Pinkney said Tuesday the investigation into Tamir's shooting is nearly complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The brief statement to reporters from Pinkney on Rice's death in November appeared to be in response to a demand last week for answers from Rice's mother and family attorneys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Pinkney said that his office could not review a redacted version of the city's investigative file on the shooting until mid-February - more than a month after the sheriff was assigned the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The redacted file lacked statements from police officers given as part of an internal review but which generally cannot be used in criminal prosecutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Prosecutors received both redacted and unredacted files in January, Pinkney said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Pinkney said that while it would be 'politically expedient' to provide an arbitrary deadline to complete the investigation, he would not sacrifice the probe's integrity to do that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He declined to take questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'All parties involved know that my department is conducting a fair, impartial and thorough investigation, one that leaves zero stones unturned,' said Pinkney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty has said the shooting evidence will be presented to a grand jury when the sheriff completes his investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Pinkney said his investigators have reviewed thousands of pages of documents and conducted numerous interviews, but a few more witnesses need to be interviewed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Some family members shouted questions at Pinkney, including Tamir's cousin, Latonya Goldsby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>'We want charges brought against these officers for their recklessness,' Goldsby later told reporters.</td></tr>
