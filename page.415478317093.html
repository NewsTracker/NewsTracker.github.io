<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Three male British teenagers suspected of planning to join Islamic State militants in Syria have been arrested by London police after being deported from Turkey, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The three, who have not been named, were detained on Friday in the Turkish city of Istanbul, Turkish sources told Reuters, after a tip-off from British authorities that two of them were traveling to Turkey via Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>London police said they had been made aware on Friday that two 17-year-old boys from the city had gone missing and were thought to be traveling to Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Further inquiries revealed they had traveled with a 19-year-old male, police said.</td></tr>
