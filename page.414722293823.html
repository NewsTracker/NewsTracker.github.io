<h3>Search for the world's 'loneliest whale' who has been singing to himself for 20 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Now an expedition is being planned to find and study the world's loneliest whale, who is simply known as 52.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Despite listening to the animal's abnormally high song of 52 hertz for over 20 years, researchers have never seen what it looks like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A team of scientists and documentary makers will attempt to find 'the loneliest whale in the world' in autumn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The creature has been calling out at a frequency not used by any other whales in the North Pacific Ocean for the last 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The unknown male whale is called 'lonely' because he appears to communicate at a frequency not used by any other whale in the North Pacific, and so far, it is not thought to have ever got a response to his songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Possible partners may not be able to hear him, or his song may be so different from their own that they can't understand it, but this has not stopped 52 singing into oblivion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Experts believe the huge mammal is most likely a fin whale, but he could be a blue whale, or a hybrid of the two species.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In order to learn more about the whale, Josh Zeman, a 40-year-old film maker based in Los Angeles, has launched a Kickstarter campaign to find and tag the 52 hertz whale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF WHALE SONG?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Together with Entourage star, Adrian Grenier and a team of marine biologists, he aims to raise $300,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So far the campaign has pulled in $57,465 and backers can receive everything from a 52 ringtone and mix tape inspired by the whale, to signed books, tickets to the film premiere and even a lesson to swim like a mermaid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'We will be mounting a 20 day expedition that will take us 400 miles off the California coast out into the open ocean,' according to the Kickstarter page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'Using state of the art technology, our goal is to be the first expedition ever to tag and acoustically monitor a hybrid whale using non-invasive tags.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He will also make a documentary about the trip, which is planned to take place in the autumn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The US Navy began passing recordings of whale song to scientists in the late 1980s, Discovery News reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It picked up the haunting noises when trying to listen for submarines in the North Pacific.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In 1989, Dr William Watkins of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution began to sort through the recordings and noticed that one whale's song was much higher in pitch than the others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Most male fin and blue whales sing at around 17 to 18 hertz, which is too deep for humans to hear, but the 'lonely' whale communicates at 52 hertz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>When more recordings were released in the nineties, Dr Watkins studied the 52 hertz whale more closely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Dr Watkins' team was able to triangulate its movements and track its location across the ocean during mating season, when whales are at their most vocal and published a paper on his findings in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In order to learn more about the whale, Josh Zeman (pictured left), a 40-year-old film maker based in Los Angeles, has launched a Kickstarter campaign to find and tag the 52 hertz whale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Scientists have been listening to the whale for two decades but no-one has seen it, so they are not sure exactly what species they are looking for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The immediate goal is to raise a minimum of $300,000 ( 194,851) to cover the costs of a scientific trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A 20 day expedition will travel 400 miles (644km) off the California coast into the open ocean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It's planned for autumn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Marine biologists hope to tag and monitor the sounds of a hybrid whale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>52 is thought to be a hybrid of a fin whale and blue whale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>They will also collect data to help scientists shed light on whether ocean noise pollution is harming cetaceans, including whales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>This is when the whale's love-lorn predicament first captured the world's attention and the 52 hertz animal was dubbed 'the loneliest whale in the world'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>As Dr Watkins sadly died from cancer before his research captured the imagination of the public, his research assistant Mary-Ann Daher has carried on his scientific legacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>She said that the team has never seen the whale they have been studying and do not know what species it is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>However, when it came to musing about the creature's loneliness, Ms Daher said: 'Is he alone?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I don't know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>'People like to imagine this creature out there swimming by his lonesome, just singing away and nobody's listening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Taylor Swift floated the idea that the whale may enjoy being solitary and used it to comment on her love life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Mr Zeman decribed the whale as inspirational in an interview with Slate magazine, and said that he wants to find the whale for all the people who think about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Most male blue and fin whales (pictured) sing at around 17 to 18 hertz, which is too deep for humans to hear, but the 'lonely' whale communicates at 52 hertz.</td></tr>
