<h3>Cannes Film Festival kicks off with a socially-minded tone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - The Cannes Film Festival unrolled its red carpet with a socially minded French drama, striking a more serious tone than the high dose of glamour the festival often opens with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Standing Tall," a film about a juvenile delinquent co-starring Catherine Deneuve, screened Wednesday ahead of its evening premiere as the festival got underway beneath sunny French Riviera skies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Directed by French actress-filmmaker Emmanuelle Bercot, "Standing Tall" is only the second film directed by a woman to open Cannes, which has sometimes been chided for having a dearth of female filmmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"For the selection we pick films, artists - not men and women, young and old," said Thierry Fremaux, the festival's director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"But I don't want to say that it's not a problem. It is a problem. We need more women, more female directors, in world cinema."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Standing Tall," which tracks an angry youth (Rod Paradot) through rehabilitation programs, received a lukewarm response from critics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But even a general shrug was an improvement over last year's immediately panned "Grace of Monaco," a Grace Kelly drama starring Nicole Kidman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Joel and Ethan Coen are presiding over the jury that will decide Cannes' prestigious Palme d'Or top prize this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Coens (who took the Palme in 1991 for "Barton Fink") were to introduce their jury, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Guillermo del Toro and Sienna Miller, later in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A splash of movie-inspired ballet was also added to the opening festivities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Benjamin Millepied choreographed an ode to Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" to be performed ahead of the premiere of "Standing Tall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Millepied's wife, actress Natalie Portman, will later in the festival make her directorial debut with "A Tale of Love and Darkness," an Israeli drama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There will, of course, be plenty of star wattage parading through Cannes over the next 12 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Thursday will bring George Miller's sequel "Mad Max: Fury Road" along with stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Woody Allen will premiere his latest, "Irrational Man," starring Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And the Pixar animation film "Inside Out" will take a bow on red carpet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Among the most anticipated films are "Carol," a '50s lesbian drama starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, and "Macbeth," a Shakespeare adaptation with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The first few days of the festival may be marked by art house entries that tend toward the bizarre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Matteo Garrone's "Tale of Tales," loosely adapted from 17th century fairy tales, promises the sight of Salma Hayek eating the heart of a beast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Yorgos Lanthimos' "The Lobster," with Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, is about a dystopian future where those who fail to find a mate are turned into an animal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cannes, already a media circus, may well turn into a zoo.</td></tr>
