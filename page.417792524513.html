<h3>Blatter could remain as FIFA head, close adviser tells Sky</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON (Reuters) - Sepp Blatter is actively considering reversing his promise to stand down as FIFA president, one of his advisers has told Sky News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Klaus Stoehlker, who advised Blatter during the recent election campaign, said Blatter could remain head of world football's governing body if a "convincing candidate" to replace him did not emerge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter stepped down as FIFA president almost two weeks ago, as the Swiss-based body was rocked by corruption allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Stoehlker, who Sky News says stressed he is not an official spokesman, was in a meeting when contacted by Reuters and unable to comment immediately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Switzerland's Schweiz am Sonntag newspaper reported on Sunday that Blatter, 79, may seek to stay on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>FIFA refused to be drawn when contacted by Reuters, saying only that "Klaus Stoehlker's mandate from the FIFA President ended on 31 May 2015" and emailing a link to Blatter's two-week-old resignation speech.</td></tr>
