<h3>CANNES WATCH: Model says fashion moving slowly on diversity</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Liya Kebede is one of the top models in fashion, but the Ethiopian stunner still sees the fashion industry as lagging when it comes to featuring people of color - and it's not the only one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Diversity is an issue - not just in fashion but in general, even in cinema. Especially when you're here, you also see it," Kebede, a L'Oreal ambassador for the Cannes Film Festival, said in an interview on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kebede earlier this year was featured on the cover of French Vogue, but she was the first black woman to make the vaunted magazine's cover in five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's a slow progress. I think things are getting better a little bit. I think this year and in the last couple of years, there has been a bit more diversity, definitely in fashion, but I just hope it's not just a phase thing and then it phases out," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I hope it's something that becomes just normal. I think it's time - well, it's been time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kebede walked the red carpet on the film's opening night with fellow models Doutzen Kroes and Karlie Kloss and Hollywood stars such as Julianne Moore, Lupita Nyong'o and Naomi Watts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The 37-year-old mother of two described the atmosphere on the carpet as "magic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It was super exciting actually. I think we were all very nervous, I think it was kind of nerve-wracking, but Cannes is always full of magic and full of excitement and that red carpet is pretty special," she said.</td></tr>
