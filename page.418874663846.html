<h3>Google+ account no longer needed to use other Google services</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google announced it would stop integrating users' Google+ profiles across its other services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google will no longer force users to have a Google+ profile for them to use Google's other services, including Gmail and YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The company will unlink the social networking profile from its other services over the next several months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The company says it "got certain things right" when creating the network, but heard consumer feedback that widely criticized aspects of the social network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We made a few choices that, in hindsight, we needed to rethink," reads a blog post from Bradley Horowitz, Google's vice-president of streams, photos and sharing,.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One of those changes is to no longer link a user's Google+ account to all their other Google products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Coming soon: you won't need a Google+ profile to use anything other than Google+.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Horowitz says the company received feedback that "it doesn't make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Instead of a Google+ profile, a user's plain, non-social-networking Google account will become their Google-wide identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The shift will take several months, Horowitz says, and YouTube will be one of the first integrated products to make the switch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>YouTube now requires users have a Google+ profile if they want to upload videos, leave comments or create a channel, according to a blog post from the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That will change in the next few weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It didn't seem like many people will miss the integration of their Google+ profiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Just kidding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Google+ Can just go away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Many people had expressed frustration that the company was seemingly forcing them to create Google+ profiles to use other services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some didn't see the point of the social network in the first place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Users who felt forced to create a Google+ profile but don't want to actively use it will have new options "for managing and removing those public profiles," Horowitz says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But some defended the service, and weren't necessarily keen to delete their profiles.</td></tr>
