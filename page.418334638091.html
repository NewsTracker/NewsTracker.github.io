<h3>Rookies Bryant, Pederson make All-Star team; A-Rod left out (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than three months after making his major league debut, Chicago Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant is an All-Star, one of two rookies selected along with Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Joc Pederson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But there was no room on the roster for Alex Rodriguez, enjoying a renaissance in his return to the New York Yankees following a season-long drug suspension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal also was a first-time selection Monday for the July 14 game in Cincinnati.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Grandal became the third All-Star this year who served a drug-related suspension for conduct connected to the Biogenesis of America clinic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Seattle slugger Nelson Cruz and St. Louis shortstop Jhonny Peralta were elected by fans to start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Albert Pujols of the Angels will start at first base for the AL in place of Detroit's Miguel Cabrera, who injured a calf muscle Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pittsburgh's Andrew McCutchen will start in the NL outfield instead of Miami's Giancarlo Stanton, who broke his hand on June 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 23-year-old Bryant made his big league debut April 17 and began Monday with a .279 average, 12 homers and 49 RBIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''Obviously, I've been at some All-Star Games, but I don't think anything can compare to making the major league All-Star team,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''It is kind of weird right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He's open to participating in the Home Run Derby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''It's all happened so quick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I've just been having so much fun with this, my baseball career,'' Bryant said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Pederson, who also expects to be in the derby, had 20 homers but was hitting just .234.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was especially pleased fellow players elected him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''They respect the way I play the game,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A record six Royals were picked for the game, with players electing pitcher Wade Davis, and AL manager Ned Yost of Kansas City selecting reliever Kelvin Herrera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They join Royals outfielders Lorenzo Cain and Alex Gordon, catcher Salvador Perez and shortstop Alcides Escobar, who were elected on Sunday as starters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''The one thing that Kelvin did that a lot of these guys didn't do was pitch in Game 7 of the World Series last year,'' Yost said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas is among the five players on the AL fan ballot for the 34th and final roster spot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rodriguez is not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''We spent a lot of time debating his name,'' said Yost, who preferred the versatility of an extra infielder or outfielder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''We felt we were covered in the DH.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The league that wins the All-Star Game gets home-field advantage in the World Series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Rodriguez is hitting .284 during a season in which he passed Willie Mays for fourth on the career home run list and topped 3,000 hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But Texas' Prince Fielder, who was elected by players, joined Cruz as the only DHs on the AL roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''As I've said all season, my number one goal is helping the Yankees win a championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>I'm excited that we're in a good position to get there,'' Rodriguez said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Yankees reliever Dellin Betances was elected by players, and first baseman Mark Teixeira was picked to fill Cabrera's roster spot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But this will be the first All-Star Game with no Yankees starters since 1999.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>St. Louis tops the NL with five players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Peralta was elected to start along with outfielder Matt Holliday, who isn't sure when he'll be activated from the disabled list.</td></tr>

<tr><td>38</td><td>''It's cool,'' Burnett said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Washington outfielder Bryce Harper, a three-time All-Star at age 22, is the youngest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Harper said Monday he won't participate in the Home Run Derby because his father isn't available to pitch to him following shoulder surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>There are 16 All-Stars born outside the 50 states, including six Venezuelans, five Dominicans, three Cubans, one Canadian and one Puerto Rican.</td></tr>

<tr><td>44</td><td>''New team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>New league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>It's just getting a look at everybody,'' said Scherzer, who left Detroit to sign a $210 million deal with the Nationals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>''Everybody's getting their first look at me and the things I've done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>I'm sure they'll make adjustments the rest of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Joining Moustakas on the ballot for the AL's final spot are Boston shortstop Xander Bogaerts, Detroit outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, Minnesota second baseman Brian Dozier and Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner.</td></tr>
