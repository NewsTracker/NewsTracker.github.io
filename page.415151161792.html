<h3>Boris Nemtsov's shaken girlfriend says she didn't see killer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Holding placards declaring "I am not afraid", thousands of Russians marched in Moscow on Sunday in memory of Nemtsov, whose murder has widened a split in society that some say could threaten Russia's future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The words under the portrait reads "These bullets are meant for each of us".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>MOSCOW - Boris Nemtsov's girlfriend has broken her public silence on the murder of the Russian opposition activist, saying she did not see the killer who gunned him down as they strolled across a bridge near the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Speaking largely without emotion in deadened monosyllables, Ukrainian fashion model Anna Duritskaya said she had little recollection of what happened in the moments after Nemtsov was shot dead on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She told online news channel Dozhd that she had not noticed anything suspicious as the couple dined at a restaurant overlooking Red Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It had not occurred to her that someone might be following them as they headed across the river towards Nemtsov's apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I don't want to answer questions about what happened on the bridge. I don't want to talk about this," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I am in a very difficult psychological condition and I cannot talk about this any more now. I feel bad ... I saw no one. I don't know where he came from, he was behind my back," she said of the killer or killers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, was shot several times and killed instantly, becoming the most prominent opposition figure to be murdered during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tens of thousands of Russians marched through Moscow on Sunday to honour the former deputy prime minister and anti-corruption fighter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Duritskaya, who is 23 or 24, said she had been under constant guard since the murder and would probably be unable to attend Nemtsov's funeral on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>All she wanted to do was to go home to her mother in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I have every right to leave the territory of the Russian Federation. I am not a suspect. I am a witness who gave full testimony and did everything possible to assist the investigation," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"They are physically not allowing me to go anywhere without them," Duritskaya said, referring to law enforcement officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They have explained to me that this is for security reasons."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nemtsov, an opposition politician whose murder has deepened a divide between liberals and Putin supporters, will be buried on Tuesday at the Troekurovskoye cemetery in western Moscow, far from where Russia's top politicians are usually buried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I cannot go out. Most likely I will not go," Duritskaya said when asked if she would attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She said she was now staying at a friend's apartment in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Investigators had questioned her several times, gone through her belongings and taken data from her mobile phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She said she was initially questioned for several hours without a lawyer or representative from the Ukrainian embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Nemtsov had criticised Putin's annexation of Crimea and his support for pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He and Duritskaya had been dating for three years, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The investigators say they are following several lines of inquiry and have come up with a number of possible motives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>One is that Nemtsov may have been the victim of a jealous former lover, a version Duritskaya ruled out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I don't think anything. I cannot think at the moment. I don't know who did it," she said.</td></tr>

<h3>Netanyahu denies split with US over speech</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The White House was infuriated by Netanyahu's address Tuesday to a joint session of the US Congress, where he laid out Israeli concerns at an emerging world deal with Iran on its nuclear programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Obama, who refused to meet Netanyahu during his 48-hour visit to Washington, dismissed the speech as containing "nothing new," saying the Israeli leader "did not offer any viable alternatives".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu, however, insisted on Wednesday that he had "presented a practical alternative, which would impose tougher restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, extending Iran's breakout time by years".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I also called on the P5+1 (world powers negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran) to insist on a deal that would link the lifting of those restrictions to Iran's ceasing its sponsorship of terrorism around the world, its aggression against its neighbours and its calls for Israel's destruction," he said on his return to Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Israeli leader also cited "encouraging responses from both Democrats and Republicans" to his address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They understood that the current proposal would lead to a bad deal and that the alternative is a better deal," said Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Israel believes Iran and world powers are likely to reach a deal that eases international sanctions on Tehran without applying sufficiently stringent safeguards to stop it developing nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Netanyahu's address came just four weeks before a March 31 target for a framework deal, and two weeks before a March 17 general election in Israel in which Netanyahu is hoping to win a third consecutive term in office.</td></tr>
