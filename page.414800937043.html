<h3>Thousands mourn Egyptian victims of Islamic State in disbelief</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thirteen of 21 Egyptians beheaded by Islamic State came from the impoverished dirt lanes of al-Our, violence that prompted the Egyptian military to launch an air strike on Islamic State militant targets in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Oh Kerollos, this is your wedding party ... I'm very sorry my son, because I did not have enough money to keep you from going to this place," he moaned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Black banners hung on the walls of the Church of the Virgin Mary, proclaiming "Egypt rise up, the blood of your martyrs is calling for you to take revenge".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Relatives fainted from grief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pictures of the victims were laid out beside images of Jesus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There were no coffins because the bodies of the victims, who were dressed in orange jumpsuits, forced to kneel on a beach and were then beheaded, were not returned home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sheikhs from al Azhar, Egypt's main center of Islamic learning which condemned the beheadings, joined the mourning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Many could not fathom why men who simply wanted to support their families back home would be butchered by Islamic State, the ultra-orthodox militant group that took over parts of Syria and Iraq and has now expanded its operations to Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They are not humans. They are monsters. They are holding unarmed people (who) were going to bring bread for their families," said Father Tawadros, pastor of the church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Facing grim economic prospects at home, many desperate young Egyptians seek jobs in Libya, a country sliding into lawlessness where armed groups battle for control and dozens of their compatriots have been kidnapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Given Egypt's high unemployment rate, other men are likely to keep streaming into Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Family members spoke of 23-year-old Milad Sameer Majli who had only been in Libya 15 days before he was kidnapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Father Sami Naseef said the stories of those killed were all similar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They were men who were down on their luck and struggling to make ends meet for their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Naseef spoke of Abanoob Atiya, 23, who had a technical degree and used to earn 320 Egyptian pounds ($42), only to give most of it to his siblings and the rest went towards transport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"After he finished his military service, he decided to go to Libya to earn money for his family," Naseef said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He never made it home.</td></tr>
