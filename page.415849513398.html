<tr><td>4</td><td>A police officer shoots rubber bullets during a clash with Islamic activists in Dhaka in 2013: the government has tried to crack down on hardline Islamist groups.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>His wife, Rafida Bonya Ahmed, suffered head injuries and lost a finger in the February 26 attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The attacks come amid a period of political turmoil in the country, with the government and main opposition group locked in a months-long standoff that has created a sense of deepening insecurity across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In recent years, a string of secular-minded writers have been targeted by religious militants in Bangladesh as the government has tried to crack down on hardline Islamist groups seeking to create a sharia-based state in the nation.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>Roy's wife, Ahmed, blamed her husband's murder in February on religious fanatics, and accused police on duty of not doing enough to stop the attack.</td></tr>
