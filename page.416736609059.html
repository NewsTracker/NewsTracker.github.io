<h3>Counsell replaces Roenicke with Brewers after 7-18 start (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Brewers fired manager Ron Roenicke and replaced him Monday with former Milwaukee infielder Craig Counsell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Brewers, a major league-worst 7-18, lost 40 of their final 56 games under Roenicke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The skid included a late-season collapse last year after they led the NL Central for nearly five months and a 2-13 start this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Counsell, a 44-year-old Milwaukee-area native, spent the final five seasons of his 16-year big-league career with the Brewers, retiring after the 2011 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''He played the game with a chip on his shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He played the game to win,'' Brewers general manager Doug Melvin said during a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Counsell was given a contract through the 2017 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Melvin said the Brewers' playoff over the last 100 games was unacceptable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Milwaukee has won consecutive games on just three occasions since Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''You'd think you'd win two games in a row by mistake,'' Melvin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A two-time World Series champion, Counsell scored the winning run for Florida in the 11th inning of Game 7 of the 1997 World Series and was MVP of the 2001 NLCS for Milwaukee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''I am grateful and honored to have the opportunity to manage the team that I rooted for, played for and worked for in the front office,'' Counsell said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''In the 10 years that I have been a member of the organization, I have grown to feel a great responsibility to baseball in the city of Milwaukee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This has been a difficult time for the Brewers, and we all share the responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I understand the work ahead to be the team our fans deserve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He became a special assistant to Brewers general manager Doug Melvin in 2012 and also was a part-time broadcaster for Milwaukee last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Counsell was among the candidates last offseason to succeed Joe Maddon as Tampa Bay's manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''Craig has many years of major league playing experience, and his three-plus years of learning all aspects of baseball operations helps prepare him for this managerial position,'' Melvin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''There will be challenges, but Craig has never shied away from leadership responsibilities on the field as a player or in his most recent role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>I believe his on-field success as a player and his awareness for preparation should resonate in the clubhouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The new manager's father, John Counsell, was a former minor league outfielder and worked for the Brewers from 1979-87, running the speaker's bureau and then becoming community relations director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Counsell had a .255 average in the big leagues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He knows something about struggling, going hitless in 45 consecutive at-bats in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Milwaukee started 20-7 last year and spent 150 of the regular season's 183 days alone in first or tied for the NL Central lead, including every day from April 5 through Aug. 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Brewers skidded to a 9-22 finish and wound up third in the division, eight games back of St. Louis and two behind Pittsburgh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Roenicke became the first manager fired 25 games or fewer into a season since 2002, according to STATS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Detroit's Phil Garner (six games), Milwaukee's Davey Lopes (15), Colorado's Buddy Bell (22) and Kansas City's Tony Muser (23) were all let go quickly that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''The reasons for our disappointing start are many, but we determined that it's in the best interests of the club to make this move,'' Melvin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In 2011, in his first season as a major league manager, Roenicke led the Brewers to a 96-66 record - the best in team history - and the NL Central title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Brewers beat Arizona in the first round and lost to St. Louis in the league championship series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Milwaukee was 83-79 in 2012, 74-88 in 2013 and 82-80 last season.</td></tr>
