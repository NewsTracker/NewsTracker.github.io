<h3>Australia remembers MH17 victims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott hopes a memorial ceremony for victims of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 plane wreck brings some comfort to the families left behind, one year on from the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I know that nothing anyone can do can bring back their loved ones, nothing anyone can say can make it easier for them," Mr Abbott told ABC TV on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Abbott suspects Russian President Vladimir Putin is horrified by the event and does not believe the Russian leader knew anything in advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The point that I made to (Putin) when we spoke about this was that, as a parent and as a human being, he owed it to the families of the victims to do what he could to try to get to the bottom of this," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It would be a credit to Russia if there was full co-operation with the ongoing criminal investigation into the plane's downing, Mr Abbott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Toowoomba man Paul Guard, who lost his parents Roger and Jill, is in Canberra for the ceremony along with nine other family members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I think it will be a difficult day, but hopefully a useful part of the healing process," he told ABC TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Abbott will join friends and family of the 38 Australian citizens and residents who died to unveil a plaque at the memorial service at Parliament House on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Former Australian Defence Force chief Angus Houston was charged with travelling to Ukraine to find Australian bodies and bring them home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The risks were considerable," he told ABC TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"There was a war going on around the crash site. There was artillery exchanges."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said the Canberra ceremony was a day to show solidarity for the families affected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"These families have, I think, suffered greatly because of the way their loved ones were lost. Essentially they were murdered," he said.</td></tr>
