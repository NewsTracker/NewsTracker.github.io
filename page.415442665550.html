<h3>Scientist Randy Olsen uses algorithms to plot the best route across the United States</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Now the man behind the 'Where's Waldo' algorithm has created a road trip route revealing the best way to visit 48 US states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Using a series of equation, the Michigan data scientist says his method can also be used on shorter journeys, beating Google maps on providing the best route possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Randy Olsen came up with the map when Discovery News challenged him to plot the best route across continental America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His only limitation was to make one stop in all 48 contiguous US states, along with Washington D.C. and two stops in California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>To create the map, Mr Olsen first found the shortest distance by road between each of the 50 landmarks provided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The tricky part was putting the landmarks in order to eliminate as much driving back on himself as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The man behind the 'Where's Waldo' algorithm has created a road trip route revealing the best way to visit 50 US states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rather than looking at every possible solution, Randy Olsen used something known as a 'genetic algorithms' which starts with just a few random solutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It then manipulates these solutions, while trying something slightly different each time, until it finds one that it can't improve on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The resulting 13,699-mile route would take 9.33 days of non-stop driving if you had the road to yourself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In his blog, Mr Olson explains how he used information from Google Maps API and wrote code to discover the optimum distance to drive to all 50 landmarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This was the same code he had previously created to discover Waldo - or Wally in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'With 50 landmarks to put in order, we would have to exhaustively evaluate 3 x 1064 possible routes to find the shortest one,' he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'If you started computing this problem on your home computer right now, you'd find the optimal route in about 9.64 x 1052 years - long after the sun has entered its red giant phase and devoured the Earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rather than looking at every possible solution, he used something known as a 'genetic algorithms' which starts with just a few random solutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Olsen, however, advises putting aside two to three months to complete the trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'You'll hit every major area in the U.S. on this trip, and as an added bonus, you won't spend too long driving through the endless cornfields of Nebraska,' he wrote on his blog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The data scientist has also created another road trip map that makes stops at the top-ranked TripAdvisor cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This map is 12,290 miles long and is similar to the original but skips over North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'This is especially interesting because TripAdvisor reviewers recommend cities like Flint, Michigan - the seventh most crime-ridden city in the U.S. - over any city in North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>I'll leave the interpretation of that fact to the reader,' Olson wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Olson also created an ideal European road trip and he's released the code so that anyone can create their own route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The European trip covers 16,287 miles and 14 days of driving, and Mr Olsen advises putting three months aside to explore the cities.</td></tr>

<h3>Kurdish fighters hold funeral for Australian Ashley Johnston, killed fighting Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The body of Australian army reservist Ashley Johnston, who was killed on the frontline in Syria fighting with Kurdish forces against Islamic State militants, has been handed over to family representatives in Turkey, Kurdish officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Thousands of Kurdish mourners followed the funeral procession through the streets of Kurdish-controlled Syrian city of Darbasiye, where the coffins of two foreign fighters - Johnston and a German woman Azad Derik - were taken to the border gate with neighbouring Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Thousands of Kurdish mourners followed the funeral procession through the streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chanting "long live the brotherhood between the Kurdish and the Australian people," and "long live for the resistance YPG in the face of global terrorism", the procession waited in the pouring rain for hours before representatives of the Peoples Protection Units, or YPG, were able to hand the bodies across the border into Turkey, a mourner told Fairfax Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 28-year-old had travelled to Europe in October, but by December he had sent a text message to his mother, Amanda Johnston, saying he was doing humanitarian work with the Kurds, who are locked in a bloody struggle against IS in both Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The YPG says he was killed in the two-week long battle to liberate the strategic Syrian town of Tel Hamis from the Sunni militants who had taken control of the area a year before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ashley Johnston, far right, who was killed fighting Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On February 26, the day his death was announced, YPG spokesman Redur Khalil told Fairfax Media Mr Johnston had only joined the Kurdish forces three months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We don't always allow foreigners on the frontline but he was a champion, he was very active and he fought until the moment he died," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He came from thousands of kilometres away to be with us and until the last moment of his life he fought for the Kurds."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kurdish forces took control of the town of Tel Hamis two days later, cutting off a key supply route from Syria into Iraq for IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under the Foreign Incursions Act, Mr Johnston would have faced 20 years' jail if he had returned to Australia, even though the YPG has received shipments of weapons carried to the region on board RAAF transport planes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Australian Kurdish Association president Gulfer Olan said the body of Mr Johnston was expected back in Australia late next week, on the Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Johnston's mother Amanda was talking to Kurdish community officials about funeral arrangements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It is understood the family wishes to hold a funeral in Canberra, Mr Johnston's home city, but the large Kurdish community in Sydney also want to hold a funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last week 500 Australian Kurds attended a memorial service for Mr Johnston in Sydney and the community has begun a fundraising effort for the Johnston family.</td></tr>
