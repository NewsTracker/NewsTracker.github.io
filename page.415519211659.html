<h3>Facebook Explains What Should Not Be Posted To The Social Network</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook removes posts containing content about direct threats, self-injury, terrorist organization associations, bullying, attacks on public figures, criminal activity, sexual exploitation and regulated goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook said that the conversations "mirror the diversity of the more than one billion people" that happens on the social network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The goal is to give people a way to share and connect freely in a safe environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sometimes Facebook has to restrict access to content because it violates laws in different countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Facebook complies with government requests to restrict content based on their local laws, but the social network company challenges requests that seem unreasonable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Facebook's Community Standards are broken into four sections: helping keep you safe, encouraging respective behavior, keeping your account and personal information secure and protecting your intellectual property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If you notice that that a Page or profile posted content that violates the Community Standards, it can be reported by clicking on the "Report" link at the arrow in the top right-hand corner of the post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>You can also unfollow, block or hide content from Pages or people you don't want to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"While the Community Standards outline Facebook's expectations when it comes to what content is or is not acceptable in our community, countries have local laws that prohibit some forms of content," said Facebook in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In some countries, for example, it is against the law to share content regarded as being blasphemous. While blasphemy is not a violation of the Community Standards, we will still evaluate the reported content and restrict it in that country if we conclude it violates local law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Facebook's policies are not changing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The updates to the Community Standards simply provides more detail on the policies and examples of what is not acceptable.</td></tr>
