<h3>Starbucks joins the race debate as clashes in Ferguson and elsewhere escalate tension</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The coffee chain known for its Frappuccinos says it will elaborate on the plans at its annual shareholder meeting Wednesday in Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Already, workers at its U.S. stores have been told to write "Race Together" on cups and the company plans to start publishing "conversation guides" on the topic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The decision has sparked a backlash on social media, with people saying it's opportunistic for a coffee chain to try and inject itself into such an important issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But it comes as corporate executives say customers are drawn to companies that project some sort of feel-good image or embrace positions on social causes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the annual meeting for Yum Brands Inc., the company that owns KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, CEO Greg Creed said in December that fast-food chains must to evolve from being perceived as "impersonal and industrial" to being able to "demonstrate that we do care."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Laura Ries, a branding consultant based in Atlanta, said that addressing big important, issues of the day has also become a way for companies to make themselves a part of the conversation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Otherwise, nobody is sitting around on Twitter discussing brands, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>People, however, don't associate their morning coffee with race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There's nothing wrong with talking about race relations," Ries said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"But is it something people naturally associate with Starbucks? It's not."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Inserting itself into national issues is not new territory for Starbucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In late 2012, the chain asked workers to write "Come together" on cups to send a message to lawmakers about stalled budget negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And in 2013, the chain placed newspaper ads saying that firearms were not welcome in its cafes after they became the site of gun rallies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the company stopped short of an outright ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>CEO Howard Schultz said at the time that Starbucks was neither for nor against guns, underscoring that even a company that wants a voice in national conversations, it must avoid alienating customers, regardless of their political or social views.</td></tr>
