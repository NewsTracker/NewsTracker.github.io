<h3>Ethnic cleansing claims as Kurds take fight to Islamic State in Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamic State fighters ask people to return to the Syrian town of Tal Abyad from the border fence with Turkey on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Beirut: Kurdish fighters have advanced to the outskirts of a key Syrian border town held by Islamic State, as Turkish forces sought to prevent thousands fleeing the fighting from crossing the frontier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have edged closer to Tal Abyad, a border town used by jihadists as a gateway from Turkey into Syria's Raqqa province, the Islamic State's stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Turkish soldiers in the foreground man the closed border near Akcakale in south-eastern Turkey as hundreds of Syrians seek refuge from fighting between Kurdish militia and Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said YPG fighters, backed by Syrian rebels and air strikes from the US-led coalition fighting IS, advanced to within a few kilometres of the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said there were only 150 IS fighters holding Tal Abyad itself, and that they had threatened to withdraw if they did not receive reinforcements from Raqqa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But the leadership in Raqqa will not send them reinforcements, because the coalition air strikes have been decimating IS," Mr Abdel Rahman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Islamic State fighters seek to return fleeing Syrians to the town of Tal Abyad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Thousands of displaced Syrians amassed at the frontier, prompting Turkish security forces to use water cannons and fire warning shots to push them away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After receiving 13,000 Syrian refugees in less than a week, Turkey accused the combined US-Kurdish offensive of driving Arabs and Turkmen out of Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in one of first public appearances since his party lost its majority in parliamentary elections, accused "the West" of killing Arabs and Turkmen in Syria, and replacing them with YPG militia affiliated with the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which Turkey and the West consider a terrorist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Islamic State fighters discuss the situation at the border fence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It is believed that 150 IS fighters are holding Tal Abyad against Kurdish militia and US-led air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The West, which has shot Arabs and Turkmens, is unfortunately placing the PYD [a Syrian Kurdish party] and PKK in lieu of them," Mr Erdogan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Arabs and Turkmen who have fled Syria charge that YPG fighters have stolen their homes and livestock, burned their personal documents and claimed the land as theirs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They forced us from our village and said to us 'this is Rojava'," the term the YPG uses to describe territory it claims across northern Syria, said Jomah Ahmed, 35, a member of the al-Baqqara tribe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He arrived from the village of al-Fwaida with dozens of members of his extended family before Turkey closed the border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mourners flash the victory sign and hold the red flag of the Kurdistan Workers' Party during the funeral in south-eastern Turkey of Mehmet Resat Cinar, a fighter with the Kurdish YPG militia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"They said 'Go to the al-Badiya desert, go to Tadmur, where you belong.'" Tadmur, captured last month by Islamic State, is more than 150 kilometres south-east of Tal Abyad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Tarik Sulo, the spokesman for the Syrian Turkmen community in northern Syria, said the US bombing support and the YPG ground forces "are changing the demography of the area in an ethnic cleansing".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said Turkmen, an ethnic Turkish minority in Syria, "are losing lands where they have been living for centuries".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The US Central Command said it was looking into the allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"As a matter of course, we neither condone any form of ethnic cleansing nor would we willingly support any such activity," said Air Force Colonel Patrick Ryder, a US military spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"But we take any such allegations seriously and will look into them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mourners pray by the coffin of Kurdish fighter Mehmet Resat Cinar, killed in the fighting for Tal Abyad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A YPG spokesman in Kobane said Kurds there gave a warm reception to Arabs who fled Tal Abyad after Islamic State captured the town a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The situation is made more complex by the acknowledgment that some Tal Abyad residents took part in IS activities when their villages were captured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Many of our sons got involved with the Islamic State," said Abu Khaled, 63, who arrived at the border crossing with his five sons and several dozen grandchildren.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Some joined Koran sessions, and others took up weapons."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A top rebel military official said that if the YPG expulsions continue - some estimates put the number at 40,000 in Hasaka province alone - they will become a recruiting tool for IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Until now we don't know what the [US-led] coalition wants. Does it intend to fight [IS] or empower [IS]?" said General Ahmed Berri, the deputy chief of staff of moderate rebel forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The latest accusations come as an al-Qaeda-linked rebel group, the Nusra Front, acknowledged that its fighters were involved in the killing of Druze villagers in north-western Syria this week, saying they had violated orders and would face justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Twenty Druze villagers were reportedly killed in the village of Qalb Loze in Idlib province on Wednesday when Nusra Front members opened fire in an incident that spiralled from their attempt to confiscate a house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Druze sect is viewed as heretical by the puritanical brand of Sunni Islamism espoused by al-Qaeda and IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In a statement, the Nusra Front said "everyone involved in this incident will be presented to a sharia court and held to account for blood proven to have been spilt".</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It did not give a casualty toll or describe what had happened in "the incident".</td></tr>
