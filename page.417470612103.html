<h3>Obama: Israel's commitment to Palestinian state in doubt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - President Barack Obama says remarks made by Israel's prime minister before an election earlier this year have reinforced a belief in the international community that Israel is not committed to peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in March that there would not be a Palestinian state on his watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That prompted Obama to say he would reassess U.S. policy toward Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu has since walked back his remarks, saying he is committed to a Palestinian state under certain conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But in an interview broadcast Tuesday on Israel's Channel 2 TV's investigative program "Uvda," Obama said that Netanyahu's initial remarks were "fairly unequivocal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Obama also said he was concerned Israel was guided by a "politics that's motivated only by fear," which could stand in the way of making peace.</td></tr>
