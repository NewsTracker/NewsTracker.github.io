<h3>Premarket: Nokia-Alcatel talks, weak euro buoy European shares</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Premarket: Nokia-Alcatel talks, weak euro buoy European shares Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>European share markets touched a 14-year high on Tuesday, supported by takeover talks between telecoms equipment firms Nokia and Alcatel Lucent, while a shifting global monetary policy outlook weighed on the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Five weeks into the European Central Bank's 1 trillion euro bond-buying scheme, European share indices are at 14-year highs and the euro is struggling against the dollar and other major currencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The single currency hit a two-year low against the yen on Tuesday, after a senior Japanese official indicated the yen might have fallen too far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The talks between Finland's Nokia and its French rival Alcatel, which could create a group worth over 40-billion ($42-billion), came as a surprise to markets, as reports had suggested Nokia might be interested in Alcatel's mobile networks arm rather than the entire firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Buying...their wireless business would have been very suitable," said Mikko Ervasti, an analyst at Evli Bank, who rates Nokia a sell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It now appears it's about the whole company and also includes units that are of non-core nature so that is slightly concerning."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By 0934 Alcatel-Lucent was up 9.7 per cent while Nokia was down 6.3 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.3 per cent at 1,643.02, having earlier touched its highest since November 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That followed a 3.7 per cent jump last week, helped by further declines in an already weak euro that is seen supporting an economic recovery and boosting corporate profits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The euro fell to as low as 126.08 yen after the comments from Koichi Hamada, an economic advisor to Japanese PM Shinzo Abe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That was its weakest since June 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Hamada's comments lead to speculation that the Japanese government is uncomfortable with rapid yen weakness," said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"In the short term, it may slow down the yen's weakness against the dollar, but against the euro, we expect it to strengthen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Against the dollar, the euro was 0.2 per cent lower at $1.0546.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Greek shares reopened after a four-day holiday weekend, trading 1 per cent lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Athens on Monday denied a report it was preparing for a debt default if it did not reach a deal with its creditors by the end of the month and said negotiations were proceeding "swiftly" towards a solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>An upbeat result would add to the case for rate hikes from the Federal Reserve later this year, and would support the dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The greenback is back near a 12-year high against a basket of major currencies, having recovered after losing as much as 4 per cent in the aftermath of a much weaker-than- expected jobs report at the start of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Earlier in Asia, Chinese shares had struggled to build on seven-year peaks a day before the country updates on economic growth, while much of the rest of Asia took a breather after recent hefty gains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.3 per cent to 512, shying away from September's top of 516.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A break there would take it to ground last trod in early 2008.</td></tr>
