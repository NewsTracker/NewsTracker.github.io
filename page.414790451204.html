<h3>Egypt launches air strikes against Isil targets in Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A spokesman for the Armed Forces General Command announced the strikes on state radio Monday, marking the first time Cairo has publicly acknowledged taking military action in neighboring Libya, where extremist groups seen as a threat to both countries have taken root in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Libya's air force meanwhile announced it had launched strikes in the eastern city of Darna, which was taken over by an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) affiliate last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The announcement, on the Facebook page of the Air Force Chief of Staff, did not provide further details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The video purporting to show the mass beheading of Coptic Christian hostages was released late Sunday by militants in Libya affiliated with Isil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The killings raise the possibility that the extremist group - which controls about a third of Syria and Iraq in a self-declared caliphate - has established a direct affiliate less than 500 miles from the southern tip of Italy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One of the militants in the video makes direct reference to that possibility, saying the group now plans to "conquer Rome."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The militants had been holding 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian labourers rounded up from the city of Sirte in December and January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was not clear from the video whether all 21 hostages were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was one of the first such beheading videos from an Isil affiliate to come from outside the group's core territory in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Libya in recent months has seen the worst unrest since the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, which will complicate any efforts to combat the country's many Islamic extremist groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The internationally recognized government has been confined to the country's far east since Islamist-allied militias seized the capital Tripoli last year, and Islamist politicians have reconstituted a previous government and parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Egypt has strongly backed the internationally recognized government, and US officials have said both Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have taken part in a series of mysterious airstrikes targeting Islamist-allied forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Egyptian government declared a seven-day mourning period after the release of the video and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi addressed the nation late Sunday night, pledging resilience in a fight against terrorism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"These cowardly actions will not undermine our determination" said el-Sissi, who also banned all travel to Libya by Egyptian citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Egypt and the whole world are in a fierce battle with extremist groups carrying extremist ideology and sharing the same goals."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The UN Security Council meanwhile "strongly condemned the heinous and cowardly apparent murder in Libya of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians by an affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant."</td></tr>

<h3>Autistic boy locked in 'scream room' with a broken hand by his TEACHERS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Carson Luke still has nightmares about the harrowing experience four years ago at a school for the disabled in Chesapeake, Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 13-year-old was sent into the secluded chamber - hidden behind metal doors and separated from the main school building - after an aggressive outburst in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When he was inside workers turned on a ventilation fan to drown out his screaming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One on occasion, faculty members broke his hand after trapping it in the heavy door as they tried to force him inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The wound was so deep the bone was exposed and he required surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He told his story as newly-released documents from the Department of Education reveal some teachers use handcuffs, bungee cords and duct tapes to restrain students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'That's code for a concrete room with deadbolts that looks like it's out of an old Russian prison,' said Carson's mother, Heather Luke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The use of seclusion rooms, as they are known, is contentious, but they are widely used across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Because of stories like Carson's, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation to rein in the use of seclusion and restraint as methods of controlling children in public schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, is expected to soon sign the bill into law, making the state the 33rd to govern the use of seclusion and restraint in schools by law or regulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Critics say such techniques are almost always unnecessary to keep order in the classroom and are actually counterproductive, exposing kids to physical and emotional injury and long-term trauma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Education, the school Carson went to used seclusion 559 times and restraint 177 times in 2011, the year Carson was injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The new Virginia legislation requires the state Board of Education to develop statewide regulations governing the use of seclusion and restraint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It was passed over the objections of lobbyists for school boards and principals who said it would allow school administrators too little discretion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Seclusion and restraint 'can be an appropriate and necessary technique to utilize in order to avoid dangerous situations and to maintain order in the public schools,' attorney Kathleen Mehfoud wrote on behalf of Virginia school boards and superintendents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The legislation was recommended by the Virginia Commission on Youth, which has studied the issue over the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The commission received more than 60 public comments, some from parents describing abusive treatment of their children at school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The mother of an autistic child described how he was held down face first on a concrete floor by five adults until he had a seizure, wet himself and passed out from exhaustion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In many cases, the parents said they weren't told when the methods were used on their children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In almost all cases, the complaints involved children with disabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Nationally, according to the commission, while students with disabilities make up just 12 percent of all students, they represent 75 percent of those physically restrained and 58 percent of those secluded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>There have been repeated attempts in Congress over the past five years to establish nationwide standards, but they have gone nowhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A 2014 survey found that 32 of Virginia's 133 school systems had no guidelines on how or whether the methods should be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The new legislation requires that the Virginia regulations be consistent with 15 principles developed by the U.S. Department of Education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>- Seclusion and restraint should not be used except in situations where the child's behavior poses imminent danger of serious physical harm to himself or others and other interventions are ineffective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>- Teachers and school staff should be trained on safe use of the techniques and on alternative measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>- When seclusion and restraint are used, parents should be notified as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Luke family now lives in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and Carson attends a school where seclusion and restraint are almost never used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>'His aggressive tendencies have almost been completely extinguished,' Heather Luke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>'The progress he's made has been remarkable.</td></tr>
