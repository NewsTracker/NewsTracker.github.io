<h3>Courtney Barnett's 'Sometimes I Sit' is incisive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cover art of the CD "Sometimes I Sit And Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sometimes you hear something new and you just know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In 2013, Courtney Barnett's "Lance Jr." popped on the radio and stopped me in my tracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This first full-length studio album from young Australian guitarist, singer and songwriter Barnett lives up to the promise of that deft introduction, which was taken from her debut, "The Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit" confirms that the first-blush crush wasn't misguided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Incisive, cutting and verbally dexterous, if a little overwhelming in a single sitting, Barnett's best new songs - "Pedestrian at Best," "Depreston" and "Debbie Downer" among them - inject memorable heft into timeless rock terrain formerly explored by Polly Jean Harvey, young and angry Elvis Costello, Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Take "Nobody Really Cares if You Don't Go to the Party," a striking, hard-strummed jam about lethargy, isolation and night life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After a friend pressures her for a night on the town while maracas shake in quick rhythm, Barnett declines, singing, "I'd rather stay in bed with the rain over my head / Than have to pick my brain up off the floor."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Wordy? A bit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With a few rounds of Raymond Carver-style editing, Barnett could cut a quarter of her syllables without sacrificing any ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The details, though, make "Sometimes I Sit" instantly alluring, and her guitar playing is just as eloquent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Whether banging Nirvana-heavy chords while singing about a chance encounter in a swimming pool ("Aqua Profunda!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In "Depreston," she offers a snap-shot moment spent in a bungalow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Narrated in part by a real estate agent, the song tells of an empty house still dotted with memories of its previous inhabitants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In what should be a theme for the HGTV show "House Hunters," Barnett croons, "If you've got a spare half million / You could knock it down and start rebuildin'."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She then drifts into a high-lonesome bottleneck guitar solo, which moves longingly until the song fades away.</td></tr>
