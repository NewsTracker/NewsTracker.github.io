<h3>Industry makes $7,000 for each tobacco death - health campaigners</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Last year, more than 5.8 trillion cigarettes were smoked, similar to 2013, as rising tobacco use in China counters declines in other countries, according to a report on Thursday led by WLF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In their global Tobacco Atlas ( http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/ ), the WLF and the American Cancer Society said that in 2013, the last year for which detailed figures were available, tobacco industry profits were more than $44 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Meanwhile, 6.3 million people died from smoking-related illness, equivalent to a profit of $7,000 for each death caused by tobacco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The report said that, if current trends continue, a billion people will die from smoking and exposure to tobacco this century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Besides causing lung cancer, which is often fatal, tobacco use is also a major risk factor for a range of other illnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is the world's leading preventable cause of premature death from chronic conditions such as heart disease, strokes and high blood pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In China, the world's most populous country, almost 2,250 cigarettes were smoked per person over age 15 last year, making it one of only around a dozen countries topping 2,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The average Chinese smoker consumes 50 percent more than in 1980, a symptom of a broader phenomenon, as tobacco use declines or is stable in many wealthy, developed nations but growing in poorer regions such as Africa and parts of Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The significant reductions in smoking rates in the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implement increasingly tight tobacco control laws have been offset by the growing consumption in a single nation: China," the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Many countries around the world have introduced some anti-tobacco laws, including curbing advertising and banning smoking in enclosed spaces such as bars, restaurants and offices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the Tobacco Atlas found that only 10 percent of the world's population are covered by comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and only 16 percent by comprehensive smoke-free legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Low- and middle-income countries now account for more than 80 percent of tobacco users and tobacco-related deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Tobacco Atlas also found that smoking among women is also on the rise, driving up rates of female lung cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In an indication of future trends, there are 24 countries where girls smoke more than boys, compared to just two countries where more women smoke than men, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Whether it's the link between tobacco and increasing rates of lung cancer among women or the ever-increasing number of health conditions and deaths related to tobacco use, the health and economic case for reducing tobacco use has never been clearer," said John Seffrin, chief executive of the ACS.</td></tr>

<h3>Tag Heuer, Intel challenge Apple with Android smartwatch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Tag Heuer, French luxury group LVMH's (LVMH.PA) biggest watch maker, said it will launch a smartwatch later this year using Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android operating system in a venture with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to compete head-on with the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tag Heuer Chief Executive Jean-Claude Biver declined to give any details about pricing, functionality or design, but said on Thursday that it aimed to launch what would be the first Android luxury smartwatch in the fourth quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Apple Watch is due to go on sale on April 24 and will range in price from $350 to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is the company's first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The device needs an Apple iPhone to work fully, and analysts say the most likely pool of initial buyers will already have an Apple smartphone in their pockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We believe wearable technology will take off," Michael Bell, vice president of Intel's New Devices unit, said at a news conference with Tag Heuer at the Baselworld watch and jewellery fair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Intel struck partnerships with several consumer goods companies last year to develop smart wearable products, including eyewear brand Oakley, owned by Luxottica (LUX.MI), watchmaker Fossil (FOSL.O), and U.S. fashion brand Opening Ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Tag Heuer's decision to partner with technology companies to deliver a smartwatch ... will likely be the first of many similar deals," Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"With Apple Watch hitting the market it's no longer viable for Swiss watchmakers to bury their heads in the sand. Now Tag Heuer has signalled its intention to enter the smartwatch market we are certain others will follow."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gucci said on Thursday that it would develop a smartband with i.am+ whose functions would include phone calls, text messages, emails and music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The unit of French luxury group Kering (PRTP.PA) gave no details of pricing or launch timing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some luxury executives remained sceptical about smartwatches, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Marc Hayek, who heads Swatch Group (UHR.VX) watch brands Breguet, Jaquet Droz and Blancpain, joined the chorus of luxury executives alongside Hermes (HRMS.PA) and Patek Philippe who said they had no plans to launch a smartwatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Apple Watch is not a real watch but a consumer electronic," he told Reuters in Basel on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hayek forecast his three brands would enjoy a similar year in terms of sales growth to 2014, although trading in Hong Kong, one of his biggest markets, remained difficult.</td></tr>
