<h3>Nationals put Stephen Strasburg on DL with stiff neck (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Washington Nationals put Stephen Strasburg on the 15-day disabled list on Saturday, a day after he had to leave a start after 16 pitches because of a stiff neck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Strasburg had a rough May, failing to last four innings in four of his five starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He left one start with tightness behind his right shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The left side of his neck tightened after the first inning of a 5-2 loss to the Reds on Friday night, and he came out of the game after facing only one batter in the second inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Manager Matt Williams said the team wants to find out why he's having back and neck problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''We've got to get the bottom of what's going on,'' Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''It's perplexing because it's not anything you can point to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Williams hasn't decided who will take his spot in the rotation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Right-hander Taylor Hill was called up from Triple-A Syracuse to shore up the bullpen for a few days as a long reliever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hill was 3-2 with a 4.35 ERA in nine starts at Triple-A Syracuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Strasburg is 3-5 with a 6.55 ERA in 10 starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The NL East leaders also are missing starter Doug Fister, who went on the disabled list on May 15 with tightness in his forearm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Nationals also learned this week that outfielder Jayson Werth is out indefinitely with two fractures in his left wrist, which was hit by a pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Strasburg, 26, hurt his left ankle during a conditioning drill in spring training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Nationals want to figure out whether the problems are caused by Strasburg changing his delivery to compensate for the ankle problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Strasburg was on his way back to Washington on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He's scheduled for exams on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''Something's causing him discomfort in his upper back,'' Williams said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''The fact that it switched sides wouldn't point to anything structural.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>We've got to get it figured out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''He's never had an issue with his arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It hasn't been his elbow or his shoulder or anything like that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It's something to do with his back and his alignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It could be from his ankle (injury) and the adjustment he's made from where he's landing and having to throw across his body more.</td></tr>
