<h3>Woman pretended to be Germanwings crash relative to get free flights: Reports</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A woman allegedly pretended to be a cousin of a Germanwings crash victim to get free flights to the French Alps, according to German media reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The woman reportedly claimed to be related to a German teacher killed on the flight and went on two trips at Lufthansa's expense with three companions, visited the crash site and accepted counselling, according to Halterner Zeitung, in a report translated by The Local.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Germanwings' parent company, Lufthansa, arranged free flights for the relatives of victims to visit the crash site in southern France after the Airbus crashed March 24, killing all 150 on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The woman is believed to have duped the airline because only a "certain plausability" was required to access the flights to avoid causing further burden to family members, a spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We regret very much that the relatives were disturbed in their mourning by this event," a spokesman told the Westfalen-Blatt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lufthansa reported the woman to police and they have launched an investigation, the reports said.</td></tr>
