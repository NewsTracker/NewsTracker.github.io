<h3>Egypt to introduce Suez Canal extension in hope of a new era</h3>

<tr><td>4</td><td>CAIRO - Egypt is to introduce a major extension of the Suez Canal on Thursday, a megaproject that has emerged as a cornerstone of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's efforts to restore national pride and revive the economy after years of unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 1869 inauguration of the canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean was hailed as a leap into the modern age, and President Gamal Abdel-Nasser's nationalization of the British and French-run waterway in 1956 was seen as marking Egypt's decisive break with its colonial past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That sparked the second of four wars with Israel, including a 1973 offensive launched across the canal that Egyptians celebrate as their greatest military victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The government hopes for another historic moment Thursday, when it unveils an $8.5 billion extension of the waterway funded entirely by Egyptians, without foreign aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The media and government supporters across the board have breathlessly repeated the same message - after four years of strife and the overthrow of two presidents, Egypt is back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our culture can be very sentimental, and this was the first time Egyptians have been so galvanized," said Adel Beshai, professor of economics at the American University in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It was a brilliant idea by el-Sissi - the Egyptians now own the canal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He views the expansion as the first step in a new area of development, free of the public sector's notoriously crippling bureaucracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The key global trade route is already one of Egypt's top foreign currency earners, and is run by a semi-independent authority with 25,000 employees that is considered one of the country's most competent bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It is opening infinite horizons. It is going to be handled outside the ossified bureaucracy that has been holding us back," Besahi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The new extension involved digging and dredging along 45 miles of the 120-mile canal, making a parallel waterway at its middle that will facilitate two-way traffic accommodating the world's largest ships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>With a depth of 79 feet, the canal now allows the simultaneous passage of ships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Originally planned as a three-year project, el-Sissi ordered the new segments to be finished in just one, citing the pressing need for an economic boost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Work has been non-stop ever since, and at one point 43 massive dredging machines were cranking away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The canal drew in in a record $5.3 billion last year, a figure the government estimates it can raise to $13.2 billion by 2023 if it doubles the number of ships transiting daily to 97.</td></tr>
