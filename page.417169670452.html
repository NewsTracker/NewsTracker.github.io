<tr><td>44</td><td>"Nobody knows what their plan but I don't think they can damage the antiquities as they did in Iraq - there are not many statues (left)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of antiquities and museums in Syria, said his department had lost contact with residents of Palmyra and cannot assess the risk to the antiquities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"I feel panic when I imagine what could ISIS do in Palmyra? They will destroy the temples and tombs - Tamourian tombs have statues which ISIS will consider as idols (that) should be demolished," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The towering structures of Roman-Greco architecture there have stood for centuries, safeguarded by previous conquering forces that recognized its historical value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>But there was little hope this respect for ancient historical heritage would withstand destruction or looting by the militants.</td></tr>
