<h3>Iraqi troops await back-up in battle for Tikrit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>More than 20 000 troops and Iranian-backed Shi'ite fighters entered Tikrit on Wednesday, having retaken areas to the north and south in Iraq's biggest offensive against the militants yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Islamic State fighters still hold about half the city and have booby-trapped buildings and laid improvised explosive devices and roadside bombs, the source in the local military command center told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>More "well-trained forces" were needed for the street-by-street battles that recapturing the city would require, the source said, speaking by phone from Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He did not give a timeline for their arrival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Victory for Iraq's Shi'ite-led government in Tikrit against the Sunni insurgents could provide a major boost to its forces as a broader confrontation with Islamic State looms in Mosul, the largest city in the north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We do not need a large number, just one or two thousand. We need professional personnel and soldiers," the source told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Military commanders had "reached a decision to halt the operation until a suitable, carefully set plan is in place" to break into central Tikrit, the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Islamic State overran Iraq's weakened army last year, seizing large amounts of territory where they have declared a caliphate and imposed brutal rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Tikrit, which lies about 160 km north of Baghdad, the extremist group still controls central districts and a complex of palaces built by Saddam Hussein, the executed former Iraqi leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iraqi security expert Hisham al-Hashemi doubted the city could be retaken with ground forces only, saying airpower was required to clear the many buildings which the IS fighters had rigged with explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>small number of residents who had fled the militants' advance began to return home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nearly two million Iraqis were displaced last year and officials have said that securing their return is a priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Friday, some 200 families went home to the town of al-Alam with a security personnel escort from the government-held town of Dhuluiya, police sources there said.</td></tr>
