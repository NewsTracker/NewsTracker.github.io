<tr><td>10</td><td>Google is looking for new ways to expand its influence in mobile as consumers increasingly pick up smartphones when they want to access the Internet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Selling its own wireless service could enable the Mountain View, California-based company to add customers for its Android operating system, which is used by many device makers, and make it easier to serve those users advertisements via smartphones and tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The new service will be available on the Nexus 6, the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The phone was developed with Lenovo Group Ltd.'s Motorola Mobility Holdings, which was owned by Google until last year.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>"Google would like to see what it can do to get greater Internet adoption," said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics LLC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The company can use the new service to get additional data on users, such as more extensive location and billing information, said J.</td></tr>
