<h3>James Holmes murder trial includes gruesome evidence, tears</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>James E. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to 166 charges, including first-degree murder, in the 2012 attack on an Aurora, Colo., theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>How much gore is too much in James Holmes murder trial?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Judge Carlos Samour Jr. has allowed prosecutors to display X-rays and autopsy photos of 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, the youngest of 12 people James E. Holmes killed during a midnight screening of the "The Dark Knight Rises" in July 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The 58-pound child was shot four times before she died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A bullet tore through her liver, spleen, kidney and pancreas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Another went through her right buttock, her hip and her bladder and remained lodged in her 4-foot-4 frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jurors wiped away tears as they listened to Arapahoe County Coroner Kelly Lear-Kaul describe the damage Holmes' rampage wrought on the fragile little body and as they viewed the images, the ghostly X-rays, the gruesome photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But will the jury in Division 201 of the Arapahoe County Justice Center ever see the sparkly sandals and tiny earrings the little girl wore on the night she died?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Yes, they are things that she was wearing," Samour told the court during the fourth week of Holmes' months-long trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"But what's the probative value? What does it go to other than she was wearing them? And then there is the risk for prejudice that those items carry with them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As jurors weigh whether to find that the 27-year-old killer deserves the death penalty, their experience in a suburban Denver courtroom raises a thorny legal question: When it comes to the gory evidence of a terrible crime, how much is too much for a jury to hear?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The panel includes a physicist and a gas station attendant, a plumber and a special education teacher - people unlikely to encounter mayhem in their everyday lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But as jurors decide the fate of one of America's most notorious mass shooters, they face horrors that make even veteran first responders weep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The 19 women and five men who constitute Holmes' jury and its alternates have seen photos of dead bodies strewn across a bloody movie theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They have heard about a woman so gravely wounded on that awful night that she had to hold her intestines inside her body until help came.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Victims on the witness stand have described how other people's blood coursed over their faces, gobs of flesh in the sticky red rivers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They have talked about the shrapnel and bullets that tore through arms and legs and collar bones, relegating at least three people to wheelchairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Defense attorneys have fought to bar the grimmest evidence, and the jury has been warned not to decide Holmes' fate based on sympathy, revulsion, rage or any other emotion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Holmes is charged with 166 counts - including first-degree murder and attempted murder - in the rampage that killed a dozen and injured 70 more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>His attorneys acknowledge that their client is responsible for the mayhem; he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Prosecutors are trying to persuade the jury to convict Holmes and to find that he deserves to be put to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They must prove every one of the charges, so jurors will hear from a lengthy parade of witnesses during the estimated five-month trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Many survivors already have testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Stefan Moton, paralyzed from the chest down, rolled up to the witness stand in an electric wheelchair maneuvered via mouth control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Caleb Medley, who cannot talk, spelled out his answers using a large white alphabet board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As he pointed, an interpreter read the letters aloud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Rick Kornfeld, a former assistant U.S. attorney, described the prosecution's performance as "certainly not of the less-is-more school of trial advocacy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He warned that even in a horrendous crime like this, there comes a point when enough is enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"You run the risk of traumatizing the jury, for what purpose," Kornfeld said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"At a certain point, you can pound them over the head with so much evidence that the stuff that really matters, they may be really punch-drunk by the time they see it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Still, during the lengthy selection process, potential jurors were warned that the evidence would be hard to bear, said Craig Silverman, a former Denver chief deputy district attorney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Those who could not stand it, he said, did not make the cut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Arapahoe County Dist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Atty. George H. Brauchler told potential jurors that the trial would be "a roller coaster through a haunted house," Silverman recounted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>And Brauchler has been careful to intersperse intense stories with more mundane testimony so as not to overwhelm the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"If the prosecution is doing its job, the jury will want to embrace the victims and react accordingly," Silverman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"It's all about capital punishment too.... You have to get people angry to vote for death."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But even Silverman, who has successfully prosecuted a death penalty case, has been unable to endure some of the more heartbreaking testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Silverman watches a live stream of the trial from his office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>But when Christina Angelique Blache testified, the veteran attorney had to shut it off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Blache, an Air Force veteran, was shot in both legs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>At one point, she testified during the trial's first week, "I looked down at my injuries. My jeans were shredded. I took my jeans and twisted and twisted to make a tourniquet so I wouldn't bleed to death."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>As exhausted first responders tried to help Blache out of the chaotic theater, she said, they dropped her.</td></tr>
