<h3>CIA sought to hack Apple iPhones: Report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The report cites top-secret U.S. documents that suggest U.S. government researchers had created a version of XCode, Apple's software application development tool, to create surveillance backdoors into programs distributed on Apple's App Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Customers try out Apple iPhone 6 smartphones in Beijing, China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Intercept has in the past published a number of reports from documents released by whistleblower Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The site's editors include Glenn Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his work in reporting on Snowden's revelations, and by Oscar-winning documentary maker Laura Poitras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It said the latest documents, which covered a period from 2006 to 2013, stop short of proving whether U.S. intelligence researchers had succeeded in breaking Apple's encryption coding, which secures user data and communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Efforts to break into Apple products by government security researchers started as early as 2006, a year before Apple introduced its first iPhone and continued through the launch of the iPad in 2010 and beyond, The Intercept said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Breeching Apple security was part of a top-secret programme by the U.S. government, aided by British intelligence researchers, to hack "secure communications products, both foreign and domestic" including Google Android phones, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that their products have not become tools for widespread government surveillance of citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last September, Apple strengthened encryption methods for data stored on iPhones, saying the changes meant the company no longer had any way to extract customer data on the devices, even if a government ordered it to with a search warrant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Silicon Valley rival Google said shortly afterward that it also planned to increase the use of stronger encryption tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both companies said the moves were aimed at protecting the privacy of users of their products and that this was partly a response to widescale U.S. government spying on Internet users revealed by Snowden in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An Apple spokesman pointed to public statements by Chief Executive Tim Cook on privacy, but declined to comment further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services," Cook wrote in a statement on privacy and security published last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron have expressed concern that turning such privacy-enhancing tools into mass market features could prevent governments from tracking militants planning attacks.</td></tr>

<h3>Apple's watch hasn't impressed the fashion world</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Supermodel Christy Turlington Burns became the timepiece's highest-profile advocate from the fashion world when she joined CEO Tim Cook onstage in San Francisco on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And the company has made a big publicity push in Paris, giving style heavyweights Karl Lagerfeld, Anna Wintour and model Karlie Kloss an advance preview ahead of a display last fall at the Paris boutique Colette.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But has it convinced the fashionistas that the Apple Watch belongs on their wrists?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Not so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>For all of the glitz surrounding the watch's introduction, the multi-tasking timepiece was met in the fashion world on Monday with a yawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Members of the style establishment, in Paris for shows from the glittering likes of Chanel, Givenchy and Hermes mostly said they saw the watch as a gadget, not this season's must-have accessory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Up-and-coming model Julia Van Os dismissed the new device in an interview with Reuters after working the Stella McCartney show inside the ornate Opera house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'I haven't heard anyone talking about it,' said the Dutch model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'It's a different world, it's more technology rather than fashion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A salesman at the famed department store Printemps agreed, saying his store won't carry the watch, which will range in price from $350 ( 232) to more than $10,000 ( 6,600) for the high-end Apple Watch Edition in 18-karat gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'You have to understand; we are luxury brands, and [the Apple Watch is] more technology,' said the salesman at Printemps, which carries such brands as Rolex, Montblanc and Longines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple's new timepiece, which will go on sale in April, links to a wearer's iPhone, and can display messages, alerts and appointments, among other things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>An array of apps can track fitness, arrange a car with Uber, and even open a garage door remotely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The rectangular watch face display can be changed by the user to feature a range of styles, from Mickey Mouse pointing his hands at the time to a simple digital clock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>French newspapers put coverage of Monday's Apple watch unveiling on their business pages, reserving their popular glossy fashion pages for the winter runway shows and ads for luxurious items such as watches by Bulgari and Boucheron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Luxury consultant Robert Burke, who is based in New York but is currently in Paris for the shows, said the Apple watch simply 'hasn't resonated strongly' in the fashion world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'Apple has notably been targeting the fashion world leading up to its launch, but the watch still has an inherently tech focused sensibility,' Burke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'The tech world and the watch world are very different,' he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Nevertheless, he added, the company's push could pay off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'Their message to the fashion world has definitely become more focused over the past few weeks,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Among other things, the company ran a 12-page advertisement in the March issue of Vogue, which Burke said people noticed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'The buzz is starting to build again,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Though Turlington noted that she was wearing her 'chic' version of the watch at Apple's Monday event, she praised it primarily as a fitness tracker, noting that it had helped her in training for a half-marathon in Tanzania and would, she hoped, help her crack the four-hour mark in her next full marathon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But her endorsement may not hold much sway with people who primarily want an attractive watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Fashion trend-spotter Roseanne Morrison of the Tobe Report said the watch's need for a nightly charge and an accompanying iPhone were considerable drawbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>'It is not attractive from a woman's point of view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Nicole Phelps, executive editor at Style.com, who attended the Apple unveiling at Colette, said Apple has one big advantage with the fashion crowd that could help as it launches its new watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'The fashion industry is 100 percent in love with iPhone,' she said.</td></tr>
