<h3>Harper says his government will ask for ?extension and expansion? of mission against Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prime Minister Stephen Harper says his government next week will table a proposal for an "extension and expansion" of the mission in Iraq against the Islamic State, and didn't rule out going into neighbouring Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The federal government's current six-month mission in Iraq against Islamic State militants - part of an international effort - is set to expire April 7 and there has been mounting expectation the government will prolong the mission until possibly after a federal election scheduled for Oct. 19, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Several dozen special forces troops have been deployed to northern Iraq since September, while six fighter jets, two surveillance aircraft, a refuelling plane and around 600 support personnel have been based in Kuwait since October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Harper said Wednesday that his government is now prepared to officially request another mandate from Parliament to extend and expand the military mission that has seen Canadian soldiers on the front lines and has led to a death of one Canadian soldier and three others injured in a friendly fire accident with Kurdish soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The current mission was authorized in the fall and that authority comes due fairly shortly. Next week it is the government's plan to move forward with a request from Parliament for extension and expansion of the mission. And I will obviously give more details when we do that," Harper told reporters at an event in Mississauga, Ont.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Asked whether the expansion of the mission could include going into Syria, where the Islamic State has a strong presence, Harper didn't rule it out, saying instead that he will provide more details next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Let me just say the current authorization laid open the possibility of going to Syria, although we have not done that, but we'll address issues like that next week when I make a proposal to the House of Commons."</td></tr>
