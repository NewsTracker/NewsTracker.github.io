<h3>Lawsuit aimed at 'ending Facebook's surveillance' is filed by student</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a closely-watched case, Austrian Max Schrems is suing the social media giant for various rights violations, ranging from the 'illegal' tracking of their data under EU law to Facebook's involvement in the PRISM surveillance programme of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The case has been brought against Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin, which registers all accounts outside the United States and Canada - making up some 80 per cent of Facebook's 1.35billion users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Within days of launching the suit in August last year, thousands of people - mostly based in Europe but also in Asia, Latin America and Australia - had signed up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the end, Schrems limited the number of participants to 25,000 but a further 55,000 have already registered to join the proceedings at a later stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Each of the plaintiffs is claiming a 'token amount' of 500 ( 360) in damages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Schrems was able to file his action against the Irish subsidiary at a civil court in Vienna because under EU law, all member states have to enforce court rulings from any other member state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Among other issues, judges will have to rule on Facebook's objection that the case is inadmissible under Austrian law - an objection dismissed by Schrems's lawyer as lacking 'any substance'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>So far, the social media company has not been available for comment on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But at the start of the hearing today, Facebook presented a long list of procedural objections to the class action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'The lawsuit is inadmissible on the procedural level - the court is not responsible,' Facebook's lawyer Nikolaus Pitkowitz told the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Schrems accused Facebook of engaging in delaying tactics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'This is a typical strategy, because most consumers will run out of time and money,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The judge said a written decision on whether the court can handle the suit will come before the summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the first hearing, attorneys for Schrems and Facebook battled on technical grounds about whether the student has the status of a private Facebook consumer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'I think we can heighten data protection with this lawsuit,' Schrems' lawyer Wolfram Proksch told reporters after the session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Facebook's lawyers did not address the details of the privacy concerns mentioned in his suit and declined to comment further outside of the court room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A specialist financier will bear the legal costs if Schrems loses the case and will take 20 per cent of the damages if he wins, meaning users can join the case at no financial risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Schrems began his battle nearly four years ago, when he spent a semester at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Austrian said he was startled by the general lackadaisical attitude towards European privacy laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'The general approach in Silicon Valley is that you can do anything you want in Europe' without facing any major consequences, Schrems said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>As a result, he set up the Europe-v-Facebook (EvF) advocacy group, which in particular campaigns for the overhaul of the so-called Safe Harbour agreement, a data exchange pact signed in 2000 between the United States and the European Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In parallel with the class action, Schrems and the EvF have also filed several complaints against Facebook in Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That case was referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) after Irish authorities refused to open an investigation into the alleged breaches of privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The ECJ's decision, expected in 2016, could have wide-ranging implications for US tech companies operating in Europe.</td></tr>
