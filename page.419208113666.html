<h3>NDP candidate resigns after Tories share Israel Facebook comments</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HALIFAX - An NDP candidate in Nova Scotia has resigned after comments he allegedly made in a Facebook discussion emerged on a Conservative website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Morgan Wheeldon was the party's candidate in the Annapolis Valley riding of Kings-Hants, but NDP campaign advisor Brad Lavigne said Monday that is no longer the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A party news release didn't provide details of what Lavigne said on Facebook, and the post has been deleted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, the Conservatives are circulating a Facebook screen grab from 2014 where Wheeldon allegedly comments, "one could argue that Israel's intention was always to ethnically cleanse the region."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Lavigne said the party is aware of information that hadn't been previously disclosed and the candidate's position was "not in line" with the NDP position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said when the party approached Wheeldon with this information, he submitted his resignation.</td></tr>
