<h3>Boko Haram killing men, tribes linked to Chad, witnesses say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The fighters separated and killed people of the Shuwa Arab community, which spreads across the border between Chad and Nigeria, while sparing people from the Kanuri tribe to which most Boko Haram militants belong, according to Mohammed Seit, a resident of Kala Balge village.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"They gathered the people in the market, and then separated the Kanuris from the Shuwa Arabs; then they informed the Shuwa Arabs that it was your tribesmen of Chad that are tormenting (Boko Haram)," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The militants said they were on a "revenge mission and to send message to your brothers the Chadians."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Scores have been killed and homes in dozens of villages burned down in the past five days, Seit said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nigeria's neighbor, Chad, has spearheaded a regional offensive and seized back major towns bordering Cameroon from Boko Haram in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a separate attack Tuesday, at least 68 men and boys were killed in an attack on the rural community of Njaba, about 80 miles southeast of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We, the women, were spared but every male including children of 12, 13 and 14 years old were killed," said resident Aminatu Mommodu.</td></tr>
