<h3>TEN's Movie Review: Chappie *** 1/2</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This fast-paced, frequently humorous and often-touching tale stars Dev Patel, Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver, but it is the titular robot himself, played using motion capture by Sharlto Copley, that steals the show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Set in the not-too-distant future in a crime ridden Johannesburg, Chappie follows super-genius Deon Wilson (Patel), an employee at the Tetravaal Corporation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He's the brains behind the unstoppable droids which are used by the police force to keep the ominous criminal underworld in the city in check.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, his dream is to create a robot which has artificial intelligence and can think and feel for himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The severe CEO of the company he works for, Michelle Bradley (Weaver), has zero interest in his ongoing experimentation, and also halts funding on the giant war machine, dubbed 'The Moose' which has been created by former-soldier employee Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman), leaving him bitter and out for revenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Deon finally manages to crack the code and create AI, installing the software into a written-off droid, but gangsters Ninja and Yo-Landi (played by South African rap group Die Antwoord) decide to kidnap the newly sentient robot to use it for a massive heist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The tug-of-war between Deon's expectations for Chappie to do good and Ninja's training of him to be a badass makes for entertaining viewing, while the high-octane action scenes coupled with the pounding soundtrack from Die Antwoord means your attention never wanes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The heart of this film comes from Chappie, which is testament to the excellently-rendered motion capture performance from Copley, leaving you rooting for him throughout.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Iran has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to the Pentagon, there may be Iranians operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Despite the reported Iranian assistance, the Iraqi forces face no easy task as they seek to advance on Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Besides the direct threat posed by ISIS fighters, they must also avoid the large numbers of homemade bombs that litter the approaches to the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Iraq has not asked the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS to provide air cover for the operation to retake Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>ISIS released a number of propaganda images Wednesday, showing several vehicles and dozens of ISIS militants with their weapons, which it said were part of a military reinforcement of Salahuddin province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>ISIS, the radical Sunni militant group, has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Monday, Iraqi forces approached Tikrit from several fronts, Iraqiya TV reported, engaging with ISIS north of the city at al-Alam and south of the city at al-Dour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The element of surprise probably was not a factor, as reports of Iraqi troops amassing near Tikrit were widely shared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>What awaits the Iraqi army is most likely a long, hard slog and not a quick rout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tikrit is a big city, and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>The offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Rights group Human Rights Watch on Wednesday urged government forces to protect civilians from revenge attacks by pro-government militias as they fight to retake Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The rights group said it had documented "numerous atrocities against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces" after they recaptured other towns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Human Rights Watch also warned that ISIS could seek to use civilians as human shields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"All commanders in Tikrit need to make sure that their forces protect civilians and allow them to flee the combat zone," said Joe Stork, the group's deputy Middle East and North Africa director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Past fighting raises grave concerns that Tikrit's civilians are at serious risk from both ISIS and government forces, and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter."</td></tr>
