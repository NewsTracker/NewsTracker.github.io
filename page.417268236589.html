<h3>NFL player Ray McDonald arrested in domestic violence case (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SANTA CLARA, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Police say Chicago Bears defensive end Ray McDonald has been accused of domestic violence in Northern California, the latest arrest for the former San Francisco 49er.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Santa Clara police Lt. Kurt Clarke tells the San Francisco Chronicle (http://bit.ly/1cWyGwZ ) that McDonald was taken into custody at 7 a.m. Monday on suspicion of domestic violence and child endangerment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clarke didn't immediately return calls or an email from The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Bears did not respond to a message seeking comment Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chicago signed McDonald to a one-year contract in late March knowing it was a gamble given his history of legal issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chairman George McCaskey even acknowledged at the time that he initially told new general manager Ryan Pace not to go after him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But McCaskey came away impressed from a face-to-face conversation that he described as ''very candid, very forthright'' and ''difficult'' after McDonald paid his way to Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His release from the team came just a month after the Santa Clara County district attorney's office announced it had declined to file charges against McDonald in a separate domestic violence investigation stemming from an arrest on Aug. 31 while celebrating his 30th birthday at his Northern California home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prosecutors cited conflicting versions of what happened, a lack of verifiable eyewitnesses and a lack of cooperation by the alleged victim, McDonald's fiancee, in explaining their decision not to pursue charges in the domestic violence investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In March, McDonald filed a defamation lawsuit against a woman who had accused him of rape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>McDonald says security camera footage will show a consensual sexual encounter occurred in his hot tub.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Police say the woman doesn't recall any sexual encounters and reported blacking out after drinking alcohol and falling at McDonald's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She said she went to police after waking up naked next to McDonald.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Santa Clara County district attorney is considering whether to file criminal charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>McDonald had been signed by the 49ers through the 2015 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He had three sacks in 14 games last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>McDonald had 19 1/2 sacks in eight seasons with the 49ers.</td></tr>
