<h3>Tourists caught out as Nicaragua volcano erupts in front of their eyes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This is the incredible moment a volcano erupts in Nicaragua - but the tourists standing right by it carry on filming even as a huge plume of smoke and ash fills the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As the vast black mass rises from the Telica volcano amid a thunderous roar, one man appears completely unconcerned as he carries on standing just feet from the crater's edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The full height of the ash plume is made dramatically clear in other footage taken further down the mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The central American country's most active volcano, Telica has registered 30 small eruptions since it rumbled to life on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The strongest yet occurring on Sunday evening, according to the Nicaraguan Geological Institute (NGI).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fiery rocks and gases spewed from the crater that night, dusting nearby towns with ash and awing residents as incandescent material shot into the night sky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It spat hot rocks, gas and ash, reaching a height of 400 metres," the NGI said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The flaming rocks caused vegetation on the volcano's slopes to catch fire and fiery balls of burning foliage created a spectacle for observers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's amazing," said nearby villager Martha Reyes, speaking to the Channel 8 network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The nearby towns of Posoltega and Guanacastal were dusted in ash following the eruptions, though no major damage or injuries were reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The geological agency said the seismic activity remained within normal range for the time being.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There is no danger, no extreme activity, that indicates an evacuation is necessary," said the director of Nicaragua's disaster prevention agency, Guillermo Gonzalez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But three evacuation centres were set up in nearby towns in case Telica's activity increases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Telica, which is 1,061 meters tall, is located in the foothills of the Maribios, about 112 kilometres northwest of the Nicaraguan capital Managua.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Telica's last major eruption was in 1948, though activity occurs every few years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nicaragua has at least 27 active volcanoes.</td></tr>
