<h3>CANNES WATCH: Salma Hayek eats Cannes' heart out</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - In a movie filled with strikingly lavish images, those of Salma Hayek eating the heart of a sea monster in Matteo Garrone's "The Tale of Tales" are hard to shake - especially for the actress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Disgusting!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hayek exclaimed Thursday morning after it showed for critics at the Cannes Film Festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The Tale of Tales" is based on the influential but little known 17th century Neapolitan fairy tales of Giambattista Basile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's a Brothers Grimm-like world of kings and princesses, ogres and witches, in a series of grotesque fables with modern relevance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Critics mostly responded rapturously to its baroque weirdness at Cannes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hayek plays a queen desperate to have a child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Advised by a warlock to eat the heart of a beast, her king husband (John C. Reilly) slays a monster, and Hayek subsequently chows down on the massive organ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our director here wanted ... the inside of the heart to be identical to the real heart," said Hayek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Forbid I would take a bite and a doctor would realize an artery is missing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There were other challenges, said Hayek, including wearing Massimo Cantini Parrini's sumptuous costumes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He never made me a dress that weighed less than 30 kilos (66 pounds)," said Hayek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Filming one scene repeatedly in which she runs through a labyrinth, Hayek said she got so tired that her heavy dress became stuck after Garrone told her to jump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Three men had to dislodge her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Massimo was screaming, 'The dress! The dress! " said Hayek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It was humiliating."</td></tr>
