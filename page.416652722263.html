<h3>Nepal quake toll passes 6100, $2b needed for reconstruction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kathmandu: The death toll from Nepal's devastating earthquake rose steadily past 6100 on Friday as fresh aftershocks and the stench of rotting bodies made it hard for nervous survivors to return to their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Disposal of the hundreds of bodies still being found six days after the 7.8 magnitude quake devastated the Himalayan nation of 28 million people was becoming a problem for officials, who have ordered immediate cremations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Morgues are full beyond capacity and we have been given instruction to incinerate bodies immediately after they are pulled out," said Raman Lal, an Indian paramilitary force official working in coordination with Nepalese forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Aid was slowly beginning to reach remote towns and villages nestled in the mountains and foothills but the overpowering smell of bodies trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings in the capital was making it hard for residents to return to their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many Nepalese have been sleeping in the open since Saturday's quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to the United Nations, 600,000 houses have been destroyed or damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said Nepal would need at least $2 billion to rebuild homes, hospitals, government offices and historic buildings and appealed for help from international donors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is just an initial estimate and it will take time to assess the extent of damage and calculate the cost of rebuilding," Mahat said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The United Nations has said 8 million people had been affected, with at least 2 million in need of tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A home ministry official said the death toll had risen to 6134, with 13,906 injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Information Minister Minendra Rijal said the government would provide $US1000 in immediate assistance to the families of those killed, as well as $US400 for cremation or burial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said earlier this week the death toll from the quake could reach 10,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That would surpass the 8500 who died in a 1934 earthquake, the last disaster on this scale to hit the Himalayan nation sandwiched between India and China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Home ministry official Laxmi Prasad Dhakal said that, even though the 1934 quake was more powerful, there were fewer people living in the Kathmandu valley then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Officials have said the chances of finding any more survivors were fading, even though a boy and a woman had on Thursday been pulled from the rubble where they had lain trapped for five days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As rescuers slowly started reaching outlying areas, witnesses reported seeing 70 to 80 per cent of buildings severely damaged in Chautara, north-east of Kathmandu towards the border with Tibet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tensions between foreigners and Nepalese desperate to be evacuated have also surfaced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In Ashrang village in Gorkha, one of the worst-hit districts about four hours by road west of Kathmandu, hundreds of villagers were living outdoors with little food and water even as boxes of biscuits, juice and sacks of rice and wheat were stored in a nearby government office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Nepal is also appealing to foreign governments for more helicopters help the 20 at work in rescue operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>China was expected to send more, Mr Dhakal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In the Himalayas, climbing is set to reopen on Mount Everest next week after damage caused by avalanches triggered by the quake is repaired, although many have abandoned their ascents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A massive avalanche killed 18 climbers and sherpa mountain guides at the Everest base camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Peter Hillary and Jamling Tenzing Norgay, whose fathers sent a wave of excitement through the world when they scaled Everest for the first time, were unbeknown to each other leading separate trekking parties to base camp when the earthquake hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>By chance, they ended up taking refuge in the same monastery village, Tengboche.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I pushed open the curtain that was in front of the door and he was sitting there in front of me," Mr Hillary said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"He jumped up and we gave each other a hug."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Both men's parties were unharmed, however Mr Hillary suffered a loss when one of his group, Greg Kay, 61, died during the subsequent night, apparently of a heart attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>After the aftershocks died down, both parties moved back down the mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With the family's approval, Mr Hillary organised a traditional local cremation pyre for Mr Kay, and combined a traditional Sherpa funeral with readings.</td></tr>
