<h3>Greece and creditors draft bailout agreement</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece and its eurozone creditors have agreed to extend the country's financial rescue package after a series of negotiations in Brussels, more than a week before the $273b EU/IMF bailout programme was due to expire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurozone's top official, confirmed on Friday that a deal that will extend Greece's loans by another four months has been reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In return, Greece has committed to not pursue any "unilateral" measures that may affect the country's budget targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece has also committed to provide a list of reforms based on the country's current bailout programme for assessment on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dijsselbloem says Friday's agreement was a "first step in this process of rebuilding trust" between Greece and its euro partners and allows for a strategy to get the country "back on track."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The review will be carried out on Tuesday by representatives from the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The institutions will provide a first view whether this is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the (bailout) review," according to the eurozone statement on Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If the institutions don't think the proposals are enough, Greece would be facing financial trouble again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Its bailout ends after Feb. 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This list will then be further detailed and agreed upon by the end of April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dijsselbloem said Friday's agreement was a "first step in this process of rebuilding trust" between Greece and its euro partners and allows for a strategy to get the country "back on track."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Trust leaves quicker than it comes," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Greece's economy has steadily improved as a result of increased tourism, but critics say that isn't enough.</td></tr>
