<h3>Top French court approves extradition of Kazakh banker</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mukhtar Ablyazov is at the heart of a legal saga that has lasted years and spanned several countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bank he once led, BTA, says he embezzled billions, and it cheered Wednesday's ruling by the Court of Cassation as a "landmark" that will help the bank recover some of its assets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ablyazov's lawyers say he is being pursued because of his activities as an opposition leader in autocratic Kazakhstan, and fear that he won't get a free trial in Russia or Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They also suspect he could be eventually transferred to Kazakhstan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wednesday's ruling comes at a time of heightened concern in the West about Russia's human rights record, after last week's killing of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ablyazov fled Kazakhstan amid the nationalization of BTA Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was arrested in southern France in 2013 on embezzling allegations, and both Russia and Ukraine have requested his extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>France has no extradition agreement with Kazakhstan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lower courts ordered him extradited, and the Court of Cassation found Wednesday that there was no legal reason to annul those decisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The next step would be for the French government to sign an extradition decree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ablyazov's lawyers urged the French government not to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lawyer Peter Sahlas said that Ablyazov could still appeal to France's highest administrative body, the Council of State, or to the European Court of Human Rights, to fight extradition.</td></tr>
