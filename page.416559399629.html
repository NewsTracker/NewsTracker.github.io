<tr><td>2</td><td>Here's what you need to know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>-EARNINGS FORECAST: Earnings of $2.16 a share is the consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, compared with a split-adjusted $1.66 a year earlier.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>-DIALING UP IPHONE: For all of Apple's new businesses (Apple Watch, Apple Pay and a forthcoming Apple television service), the iPhone is still the straw that stirs the drink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple sold a staggering 74.5 million iPhones in the December quarter, helping to fuel the most profitable quarter ever for any publicly traded company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Now we'll see what the iPhone can do for an encore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus delivered the big-screen smartphone experience that many consumers wanted from Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Analysts polled by Fortune Magazine forecast that Apple sold 56.8 million iPhones during the March quarter, 30% more than a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>-CASH-BACK PLAN: It's easy to forget that Apple didn't begin returning cash to shareholders until 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Over the past three years, Apple has paid out $103 billion through share buybacks and dividends, part of a plan to return $130 billion in cash by the end of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Apple has said it plans to update its plans on Monday, presumably increasing the size and duration of the program.</td></tr>

<tr><td>21</td><td>According to Apple's website, those looking to order a Watch now will have to wait until June to receive the device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Apple already has said it won't break out sales of the Watch, afraid that doing so will give competitors useful information about the new product category.</td></tr>
