<h3>Court upholds mansion repossession</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Brian O'Donnell has been holed up in the palatial spread in Killiney, complete with tennis court overlooking Dublin bay, since Monday afternoon when receivers were due to repossess the property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the High Court, Judge Brian McGovern was told the gargoyle-effect letter box at the seven million euro ( 5 million) coastal pile was no longer in use while Bank of Ireland, which has secured a 71 million euro ( 52 million) judgement for the lawyer's debts, only had one email address for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blake O'Donnell, also a solicitor, said in court that it was "ridiculous" that he had to phone his father and his psychiatrist mother Dr Mary Patricia, who remain in Gorse Hill, Vico Road, to tell them to get out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We can do this the easy way or make it more difficult," Judge McGovern told him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A repossession notice will now be fixed to the gates of the luxury house, worth in the region of 34 million euro ( 25 million) in the boom years but now valued at about a fifth of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is due to be handed over after a four-year battle with Bank of Ireland over property investment debts and an unsuccessful attempt by the O'Donnells to be declared bankrupt in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Judge McGovern said the last-ditch attempt to stop the repossession and eviction was a device to frustrate previous orders of the courts, including the Supreme Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The O'Donnells' adult children - Alexandra, Blaise, Blake and Bruce - launched the legal challenge claiming that their parents had a right to residency in the mansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The judge also heard that up until a few weeks ago the O'Donnells were asserting that they were permanently resident in London, not Gorse Hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The property is in one of the most sought-after residential locations in Ireland, home to stars like Bono.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nestled into the hillside overlooking Killiney beach, it would boast unspoilt views into Dublin Bay, south to Bray Head and east to Wales on a clear day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Court hearings have been told how the O'Donnells bought it for 1.4 million euro ( 1 million) in 1998 and over the years they undertook a complete renovation, including buying an adjacent piece of land to expand the mansion and grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Following the phonecall to his parents, Mr O'Donnell junior revealed that his father insisted he was not party to the latest twist in the court battles and that he would not be leaving the property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cian Ferriter, senior counsel for Bank of Ireland, told the court separate trespass proceedings were being launched against the O'Donnells.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The barrister said Mr and Mrs O'Donnell had adopted a "shocking approach" which had been anticipated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Judge McGovern gave the bank and receiver permission to fix a repossession notice to the gate and notify the O'Donnells by the intercom system "if there's one still working".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The case is due back before the High Court on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Court hearings had previously heard claims that the property had been held in trust for the O'Donnell brothers and sisters, who vacated the home following the original order, and that it should not have been taken as security on other property loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr and Mrs O'Donnell had built a near billion euro portfolio of property investments since the early 2000s which turned sour due to the hundreds of millions they borrowed in the run-up to the global credit crunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The list included investments in Canary Wharf, Westminster, Stockholm, Washington DC and closer to home in Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The O'Donnells are being supported by members of the New Land League, a campaign group set up to oppose repossessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It takes its name from Michael Davitt's 19th-century fight against landlords in Ireland, many absentee, who refused to cut rents in the Great Famine and were evicting smallholders, known as cottiers, from homes and cottages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Jerry Beades, a spokesman for the group and claiming to speak on behalf of the O'Donnells outside the Four Courts, said the case was no different to every other bank repossession in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The injunction proceedings have failed but the case still goes on," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mr Beades said there remained "huge irregularities" around the proceedings and the O'Donnells were entitled to due process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"They will be putting up a vigorous defence to these proceedings," the campaigner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mr Ferriter, for Bank of Ireland, said an affidavit on what was happening on the ground at Gorse Hill uncovered a "disturbing dimension" to the case, with evidence that the "self-styled" Land League were positioned inside the gates of the property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The barrister said Mr O'Donnell was trying to style himself as a "tenant cottier" who cannot speak out for himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Blake O'Donnell, asked to clarify the situation at his former home, said he had spoken with his father briefly last night and he maintained he had invited a few of his friends around, who happened to be members of the Land League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"They are friends of his," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>His father told him he had residency rights in the property stretching back 15 years, Mr O'Donnell junior added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mr Beades said the issues in the case are a matter of principle and the same for the O'Donnells in Killiney as a "Mrs Murphy in Tipperary".</td></tr>

<h3>Former CIA director Petraeus pleads guilty to federal charge: DOJ</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Petraeus, 62, will plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material under the deal, according to documents filed on Tuesday in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The plea agreement announced by the Justice Department marks the latest chapter in an astonishing fall from grace for Petraeus, an intellectual with a Princeton University doctorate and a counter-insurgency expert widely considered one of America's most important military leaders of recent decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He served stints as the top U.S. commander in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and then as CIA director and was lauded by senior U.S. lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But his career came crashing down thanks to an extramarital affair with his biographer, former Army Reserve officer Paula Broadwell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Petraeus faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But under the deal prosecutors and his lawyers are recommending a $40,000 fine and two years of probation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Petraeus had previously said he did not provide classified information to Broadwell, who was writing his biography, titled "All In: The Education of General David Petraeus," along with another author at the time of the affair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But court papers filed with the plea deal stated Petraeus in 2011 unlawfully gave Broadwell the black books of classified information including identities of covert officers, code word information, war strategy, intelligence capabilities, diplomatic talks and information from high-level White House National Security Council meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Petraeus then lied to the FBI about it, the court papers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Petraeus holds a senior post at private-equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), which said he will stay in his role of chairman of the KKR Global Institute, its economic and geopolitical think tank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Petraeus quit as CIA director under President Barack Obama in November 2012 after the affair was discovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The plea deal enables Petraeus to avoid a potentially embarrassing criminal trial in which details of his affair promised to figure prominently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One of Petraeus' leading supporters, Republican Arizona Senator John McCain, said with the plea deal, "I believe it is time to consider this matter closed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>McCain praised Petraeus for his distinguished career and said he has apologized and expressed deep regret.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Another former CIA director, John Deutch, was accused of mishandling classified material and agreed to plead guilty, but President Bill Clinton stepped in and pardoned him in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Court documents detailing the plea agreement said that while serving as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Petraeus maintained the eight 5-by-8 inch (13-by-20 cm) notebooks with black covers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Petraeus kept the black books after retiring from the military in 2011, the documents stated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In August 2011, Petraeus agreed to provide the black books to Broadwell, referred in the documents not by name but as his biographer, and delivered them to a private residence in Washington where she was staying as source material for the book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The documents said Petraeus left the books with Broadwell for about four days before taking them back to his home in Arlington, Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After resigning from the CIA that November, Petraeus signed a security form assuring that he did not possess any classified information even though the notebooks were still at his home, the documents stated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>With a search warrant, the FBI in April 2013 went to his home and seized the black books from an unlocked drawer in his first-floor study, the documents said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The court documents also said Petraeus lied to FBI investigators in October 2012, shortly before he quit the CIA, by saying he had never given classified information to his mistress.</td></tr>
