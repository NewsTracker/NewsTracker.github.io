<h3>Top French court approves extradition of Kazakh banker</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mukhtar Ablyazov is at the heart of a legal saga that has lasted years and spanned several countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bank he once led, BTA, says he embezzled billions, and it cheered Wednesday's ruling by the Court of Cassation as a "landmark" that will help the bank recover some of its assets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ablyazov's lawyers say he is being pursued because of his activities as an opposition leader in autocratic Kazakhstan, and fear that he won't get a free trial in Russia or Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They also suspect he could be eventually transferred to Kazakhstan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wednesday's ruling comes at a time of heightened concern in the West about Russia's human rights record, after last week's killing of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ablyazov fled Kazakhstan amid the nationalization of BTA Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was arrested in southern France in 2013 on embezzling allegations, and both Russia and Ukraine have requested his extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>France has no extradition agreement with Kazakhstan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lower courts ordered him extradited, and the Court of Cassation found Wednesday that there was no legal reason to annul those decisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The next step would be for the French government to sign an extradition decree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ablyazov's lawyers urged the French government not to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lawyer Peter Sahlas said that Ablyazov could still appeal to France's highest administrative body, the Council of State, or to the European Court of Human Rights, to fight extradition.</td></tr>

<h3>How To Turn Your Home Into A Beach House, Because That's Clearly The Way To Beat Winter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's hard not to plan a sunny summer escape, even as snow continues to fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Or we could just make a beachy getaway at home, one that will last ALL year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chilly days are the perfect time for a decor overhaul, and getting a breezier vibe inside is easier than you'd think.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>We've taken design inspiration from some of our favorite coastal homes, with special cues from a glorious set of rental cottages in Tybee Island, Georgia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Take notes from their design code, and watch your interior start to feel like summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A fern, palm or orchid is a bold way to make your home feel like the tropics... and who said it had to be real?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Place it in a rustic planter or on a flower stool for added kitsch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Replace your colored linens with whites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>White towels and sheets not only build a beachy-clean look, but they'll also make your home feel instantly luxurious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>(Have you ever noticed that every nice resort has all-white linens?)</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Turn your porch into a tropical oasis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Take tips from a real-life beach cottage and clear the clutter off your porch, invest in a wicker chair or furniture set and add a graphic pillow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The first warm-weather day in your new hideout will feel like a mini vacation to a quaint Georgia isle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Think bright, whimsical tones that remind you of carefree days at a pier-side cottage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Corals, blues and yellows are especially zippy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And for bedrooms, pick a beachy print that works year-round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some of the most functional cottages incorporate subtle, nautical-print bedspreads that work during summer and the rest of the year -- a coral print, shell motif or stripe pattern is breezy without being too loud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Go for the hammock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Not everyone has a porch, but chances are you've got space somewhere to hang an indoor hammock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Any room -- from bedrooms to sun porches to that alcove by the stairs -- can turn into an easy catnap spot that reminds you to live on island time.</td></tr>
