<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The biggest exercises since Cold War days will last for a week, amid growing tensions between Russia and NATO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Joint Viking, Norway's biggest military training exercise in nearly 50 years, is being held in the country's far northeast Finnmark County, above the Arctic Circle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The region borders Russia's Kola Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The last time a similar military exercise was conducted in Finnmark was in 1967.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Today the army will transport their vehicles and crews to Finnmark and begin exercise Joint Viking. This is an operative exercise with all weapons and branches involved," Norwegian Army spokesperson Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Aleksander Jankov said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"To illustrate the magnitude of this, I can mention that if we put the vehicles one after another on the road it will stretch 6km."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Apart from the ground troops involved, the exercise (which will last until March 18) has put Norway's Navy submarines and surface vessels off the coast of Finnmark and Air Force fighter jets on alert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>All types of weapons are promised to be put to use, reports the Barentz Observer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The buildup of military activities next to Russian border does not promote restoration of confidence in Euro-Atlantic, acknowledged Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov after meeting with his Spanish counterpart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We believe problems should be resolved through equitable and mutually respecting dialogue," Lavrov said, stressing that Moscow reserves the right to "react adequately" to the drills in Norway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Russian Air Force staged military training of its own last week, when fighter jets from Monchegorsk Air Base on the Kola Peninsula trained intercepting enemy cruise missiles and aircraft.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine's military says pro-Russian rebels using truce to amass weapons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kiev: Ukraine's military says pro-Russian rebels are amassing heavy weapons in depots around separatist-held Donetsk city despite a ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attacks have fallen in the past week, but accusations from both sides of violations show the fragility of the peace deal agreed in Minsk last month, which calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the frontline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"[Rebels] are continuing to transport equipment and artillery ammunition intensively via the Debaltseve railway junction and build weapons storages around Donetsk," military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said in a televised briefing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A rebel soldier looks in the direction of Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitors the pull-back of weapons, has said it cannot fully confirm withdrawal on both sides as it has not been given access to all the locations where some weapons have been moved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lysenko said Ukrainian positions had come under attack from separatists 31 times on Monday, including five instances of artillery fire, and reported nine servicemen had been wounded in the past 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The most troubled areas are Shyrokyne and around Donetsk airport ... yesterday there was fighting almost all day in Shyrokyne," Lysenko said, referring to a village on the outskirts of government-held Mariupol, a strategic port city Kiev fears could be the focus of the next rebel offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chains of ammunition hang in a room dubbed "the sniper's bedroom" at a pro-Russian rebel base on the outskirts of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On the rebel side, officials said Ukrainian forces had violated the ceasefire 17 times in the past 24 hours, but reported no casualties, separatist press service DAN said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said earlier that the ceasefire deal was largely holding, but the army is still sustaining losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sixty-four soldiers have been killed since the peace deal came into effect on February 15, bringing to 1549 the number killed since the war started, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The separatists rarely announce their own casualty figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of providing separatists with troops, training and weaponry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Moscow denies this but has remained under strong diplomatic pressure from European capitals and Washington during the peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond on Tuesday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of undermining other former Soviet republics, besides Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We are now faced with a Russian leader bent not on joining the international rules-based system which keeps the peace between nations, but on subverting it," Hammond told the Royal United Services Institute in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"President Putin's actions - illegally annexing Crimea and now using Russian troops to destabilise eastern Ukraine - fundamentally undermine the security of sovereign nations in Eastern Europe," he said as NATO forces prepared for a major exercise in the Baltic states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>US military officials said deployment of about 3000 troops had begun for the three-month Operation Atlantic Resolve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The exercise will see NATO forces working alongside their allies in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The United States also said on Monday it had delivered more than 100 pieces of heavy military equipment to the Baltic states.</td></tr>
