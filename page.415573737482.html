<h3>International Criminal Court should prosecute Islamic State for Iraq genocide, war crimes: UN</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a report based on interviews with more than 100 alleged victims and witnesses, it urged the UN Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for prosecution of perpetrators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The report also said Iraqi government forces and affiliated militias "may have committed some war crimes" while battling the insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The UN Human Rights Council launched its inquiry in September after the Islamist militant group Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, seized large swathes of northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The report said the Council had found "information that points to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes", and that the Security Council should "consider referring the situation in Iraq to the International Criminal Court".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There was a "manifest pattern of attacks" by Islamic State on Yazidis as well as Christians and other minorities as it laid siege to towns and villages in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The UN investigators also cited allegations that ISIL had used chlorine gas, a prohibited chemical weapon, against Iraqi soldiers in the western province of Anbar in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Captured women and children were treated as "spoils of war", and often subjected to rape or sexual slavery, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The report said that ISIL's Islamic sharia courts in Mosul had also meted out cruel punishments including stoning and amputation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Thirteen teenage boys were sentenced to death for watching a football match," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The UN investigators said it was "widely alleged" that Iraqi government forces had used barrel bombs, an indiscriminate weapon banned by international law, but this required further investigation.</td></tr>

<h3>Clarke plans to continue one-day career after World Cup</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clarke has long suffered a back condition and in recent months battled a succession of hamstring injuries that have prompted calls for the 33-year-old to retire from the shorter format to prolong his career in test cricket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clarke poured cold water on the idea on the eve of Australia's quarter-final against Pakistan in Adelaide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"And I have managed to play over 200 one-dayers and over 100 test matches so it hasn't stopped me to date. And I don't think it will do after this series either."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clarke has battled back into the team after a long lay-off from hamstring surgery that saw him miss Australia's opening pool win against England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Off-field, Clarke's relationship with selectors and coach Darren Lehmann was questioned after he was set a deadline to be fit by the second pool match against Bangladesh or risk missing out on the tournament on home soil altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It seemed a harsh ultimatum for a player that has scored over 16,000 runs for Australia in one-day and test cricket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"A lot of players have had injuries throughout their career and worked their backsides off to get back out on the park," Clarke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Walking back out on the field to represent your country is a very special feeling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"But if you don't perform you don't get that opportunity. I'm fortunate to be back out on the park and I need to make sure I'm performing and leading the way as captain of this team."</td></tr>
