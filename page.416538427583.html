<h3>German Chancellor, Greek PM agree to stay in touch to reach debt deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, April 26 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed in a phone conversation on Sunday to maintain contact during talks between Athens and its lenders to reach a debt deal, a Greek government official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"During their communication, they expressed their common will for a steady communication throughout the course of negotiations in order to have a mutually beneficial solution soon," said the official, who declined to be named.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Shut out of international markets and locked in talks with its European Union and International Monetary Fund creditors over its proposed reform-for-cash deal, Greece risks running out of cash within weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But during a regular meeting at the Latvian capital of Riga on Friday, euro zone finance ministers warned its government that it would get no fresh aid until it agreed to a complete economic reform plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The official said that the technical teams from Greece and its creditors -- the so-called Brussels Group -- would hold a teleconference on Monday and convene on Wednesday to speed up negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Three months of fruitless negotiations have raised tensions between Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis and euro zone colleagues in Riga on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Euro zone ministers - the so-called Eurogroup - bemoaned talks they felt "were going nowhere" and one minister said that maybe it was time governments prepared for the plan B of a Greek default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Responding to reports that he was isolated in debt talks, Varoufakis tweeted a quotation by American statesman Franklin Roosevelt on Sunday which read "they are unanimous in their hate for me; and I welcome their hatred."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Varoufakis said the quote expressed his feelings in recent days.</td></tr>
