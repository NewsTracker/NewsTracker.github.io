<h3>800,000 Children Forced From Homes in Boko Haram Violence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Each day brings new reports of atrocities, with mass graves being discovered in towns seized back from the militants who had set up a so-called "Islamic caliphate" across a great swath of northeast Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boko Haram's nearly 6-year-old Islamic uprising in northeast Nigeria that has killed thousands - a reported 10,000 just last year - and forced more than 1.5 million from their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The children's drawings show men with guns, a coffin, a car exploding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One picture has stick-like figures of eight siblings missed by their teenage sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The disturbing images come from some of an estimated 800,000 children forced from the homes by Boko Haram extremists, according to a UNICEF report published Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It says the number of refugee children has doubled in the past year, making them about half of all the 1.5 million Nigerians made homeless in the Islamic uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Children have become deliberate targets, often subjected to extreme violence - from sexual abuse and forced marriage to kidnappings and brutal killings," the report says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Children have also become weapons, made to fight alongside armed groups and at times used as human bombs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The number of children absent from primary school in Nigeria has increased from 8 million in 2007 to 10.5 million- the highest figure in the world, it says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Boko Haram has targeted schools, destroying or severely damaging more than 300 and killing 314 students and 196 teachers, UNICEF says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The nickname of Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremist group, Boko Haram, means "Western education is forbidden" or sinful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One picture in the UNICEF report shows stick figures of the eight siblings missed by Rita, a 14-year-old living in a refugee camp in neighboring Chad with her mother, father and one younger sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They became separated when Boko Haram attacked the Nigerian town of Baga, and she knows how worried they must be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"When you have your mother around, you (are) not worried about anything. But if she is missing ... you are worried the whole time," the report quotes Rita as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Called "Missing Childhoods," the report was published ahead of the first anniversary of the mass kidnappings the night of April 14-15, 2014, of nearly 300 schoolgirls from Chibok.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dozens escaped on their own but 219 remain missing.</td></tr>
