<h3>One Direction blast off into space in 'Drag Me Down' video, without Zayn</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One Direction have gone out of this world in their latest video, with their first music video since Zayn Malik left the popular boyband featuring the lads blasting off into space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The four remaining members, Harry, Louis, Niall and Liam, shot the video at the NASA Space Centre in Houston, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the video, they turn into astronauts and are sent into space in very fetching orange spacesuits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The video has been a hit with One Direction fans, garnering almost 500,000 views in three hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's arguable that the guerrilla nature of the video release was orchestrated to combat dwindling single sales, which saw the single plummet in the charts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There are some gratuitous shots of the much-lusted-after boyband working out in sportswear, which is sure to send their fanbase wild.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The views on the Drag Me Down music video are not going up?!</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>&#x2014; OTRA Updates!</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Zayn Malik has had a quiet month - he hasn't yet released any official solo material though his spat with Calvin Harris over Taylor Swift kept him in the headlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, some argue Malik had the strongest voice in One Direction, so his next release is likely to challenge 'Drag Me Down' in the charts.</td></tr>
