<h3>Yahoo lands rights to show NFL game on Internet this fall</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - The NFL is teaming up with Yahoo to show a game live on the Internet this fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The alliance announced Wednesday follows up on the NFL's previously announced plan to stream the Oct. 25 matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The game, which will be played in London, is scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. EDT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It will be the first time that the NFL has allowed one of its games to be streamed live in its entirety by an Internet outlet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Bills-Jaguars game will still be televised, like all other NFL games, in the local markets of the two teams playing each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Landing the rights to show the game represents a coup for Yahoo, which is trying to widen its audience and sell more advertising after more than six years of little or no revenue growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yahoo Inc. declined to say how much it is paying the NFL to stream the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>NFL games are among the most-watched events on TV, making them a valuable commodity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The NBC, CBS, ESPN and Fox networks signed long-term deals in 2011 calling for them to pay the NFL an average of about a combined $5 billion per season through this decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That works out to an average of almost $19 million per game, including the playoffs and Super Bowl.</td></tr>
