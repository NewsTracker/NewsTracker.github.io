<h3>WHO official concerned as decline in Ebola cases levels off</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The steep decline in Ebola case numbers has levelled off over the past month and the development is a cause for concern, the official leading the World Health Organization's response to the outbreak said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dr. Bruce Aylward told reporters "today is the first time we have the data to demonstrate this" flattening of the curve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The United Nations has said 10 times fewer people are being diagnosed with Ebola each week than in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Over the past four weeks, however, the line of the graph has flattened out, with the rate around 120 to 150 new cases a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's what keeps me up at night right now," Aylward said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is not what you want to see with Ebola."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Health officials have expressed optimism in recent weeks that the tide seems to be turning in the fight against the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The presidents of the three worst affected countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, this week said they hope to reduce the number of new cases to zero by April 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Aylward said that goal will be difficult to achieve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The steep decline in case numbers came about as health workers worked hard for months to ensure safe burials for the dead and treatment beds for the sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Now, for the final push to zero, the focus must swing to finding cases and tracing the personal contacts of each person infected with Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Aylward said these efforts are complicated by the "extraordinary measures" taken by people who do not want to be included on the contact list because of the stigma associated with the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More than 23,300 have been infected by Ebola, and almost 9,500 people have died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Aylward was meeting Friday with the United Nations Ebola chief, Dr. David Nabarro, on how to end the outbreak that began in December, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They said they have the strategy to get it done, but financing remains a concern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nabarro told reporters that about $1.5-billion is needed for 2015 but around $600-million of that has been raised so far.</td></tr>

<h3>More Australians recognise the Magna Carta than they do our constitution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The good news is, more than a half of Australians have heard of the Magna Carta, one of the founding documents of modern law and democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bad news is, less than two-thirds of have heard of the Australian Constitution, a new survey has found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Ipsos MORI survey was commissioned across 23 countries as part of the commemorations of the Magna Carta's 800th anniversary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Most Australians are concerned about the right to freedom of speech being curbed today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>More than 1000 Australians were surveyed, of whom 65 per cent had heard of the Australian Constitution, 59 per cent of the US Declaration of Independence, and 53 per cent of the Magna Carta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Aussie awareness of the old document which established, among other things, the rule of law over the king, the right to trial by jury and the freedom from arbitrary arrest, was significantly higher than the international average of 39 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Great Britain and the USA did best, Australia came sixth of the countries surveyed behind Spain, Italy and Hungary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Only six per cent of the French said they were aware of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The survey results relating to the awareness of the Magna Carta by Australians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The survey did not explore whether Australia's knowledgeable score was thanks to a successful educational system, the popularity of the (hideously ahistorical) Russell Crowe Robin Hood movie, or what you might call "The Castle" syndrome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>According to the Australian Senate website, "Magna Carta is much quoted by Australians when they are representing themselves in court cases."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some of its clauses are still part of Australian law inherited from the UK, though actually citing it in court is usually considered the sign of a rank amateur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>- 39 per cent of Australians felt that freedom of speech was under threat today in Australia, 35 per cent felt basic human rights were under threat, and 27 per cent chose freedom of religion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>- In China, the survey organisation was not allowed to ask which rights people felt were under threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most other countries came up with similar answers to Australia, but India was more concerned with equal rights for women, and Russia with freedom from arbitrary arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As part of the anniversary this year, Australia's 1297 copy of the Magna Carta will be removed from its glass case at Parliament House for the first time in 50 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It will be digitally scanned, examined by conservation experts then placed in a new display case.</td></tr>
