<h3>CIA manager who had been removed from his job is back</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A top CIA manager who had been removed from his job last year for abusive management has been named to a senior role in the agency department that conducts drone strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jonathan Bank, 47, has been installed as deputy chief for counterintelligence at the Counter Terrorism Center, or CTC, which conducts the agency's operations against al-Qaida, the Islamic State and other groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bank was ousted as the head of the agency's Iran operations division at headquarters a year ago after an internal investigation found he had created an abusive and hostile work environment that put the crucial office in disarray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Several key employees had requested transfers, according to current and former U.S. officials who refused to be identified speaking about a sensitive personnel matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a move officials said was without precedent, Bank was sent home from CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and transferred to a liaison job at the Pentagon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He was barred from CIA management for a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Bank has emerged, current and former U.S. officials say, after a bureaucratic reorganization by CIA director John Brennan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As part of the changes, the Counter Terrorism Center got new leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The old chief, Michael D'Andrea - a legendary figure who worked so many hours he frequently slept in his office - was transferred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Uneven management has been a persistent challenge at the CIA, particularly in the operations division, where internal surveys have shown that bad managers are the top reason officers cite in resigning the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Brennan's reorganization includes new leadership training, but one of the complaints has long been that senior CIA leaders are not held truly accountable for misconduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Bank's name has been public since 2010, when he had to be evacuated as Pakistan station chief after he was named in a lawsuit accusing him of wrongdoing in connection with U.S. drone strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earlier this month, a Pakistani judge ordered Bank and former CIA general counsel John Rizzo to face murder charges in that country over a drone attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bank also served at CIA stations in the Balkans, Moscow and Baghdad, former agency officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was a top assistant to James Pavitt, who from 1999 to 2004 headed the CIA's espionage arm, the Directorate of Operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When he was removed from his Iran job, he also lost a chance for a posting in London, current and former officials said.</td></tr>
