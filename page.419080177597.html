<h3>New Ebola cases in single digits another week, says WHO</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) - New Ebola cases were in the single digits another week, the World Health Organization said Wednesday, showing that contact tracing efforts are yielding results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The path to zero cases, however, remains a challenge as the West African nations that have seen most of the more than 11,200 deaths from Ebola - Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - head into rainy season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Zero is an achievable goal in the near term, there's no question, but there are a lot of hazards between here and there, a lot of rain, still a lot of missing contacts," Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO's Ebola head, said from Geneva on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>WHO reported two confirmed cases of Ebola -one in Guinea and one in Sierra Leone- in the week ending Aug. 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It credited strengthened contact tracing and investigations for what it said was the lowest weekly total since March 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This week, Sierra Leone has reported two new cases, both relatives of a man who died from Ebola in Tonkolili, an area that hadn't seen the deadly virus in months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nearly 2,000 contacts are being monitored across five prefectures in Guinea and four districts in Sierra Leone, including 500 in the Tonkolili district, said WHO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>More cases are likely in the coming weeks in Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There's two or three areas still at particularly high risk of having a flare (of cases)," Dr. Aylward said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>WHO also said in its report that while a vaccine tested in Guinea may prove effective, "more conclusive evidence is needed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last week, WHO's chief Dr. Margaret Chan described the shot as a potential "game-changer."</td></tr>
