<h3>Edward's Snow Den tagged in White House on Google Maps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It was thought that Edward Snowden was living in a secret location in Russia after his 2013 leaks made him a wanted man by the US Government - but it seems he's actually set up shop in the middle of the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At least, that's where the whistleblower is according to Google Maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A business called Edward's Snow Den has appeared in the US President's headquarters thanks to the clever work of internet pranksters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nothing happens when the icon for it is clicked, but for a short while it was listed as a snowboard shop, open between 5am and 11pm, according to thenextweb.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Several reviews appeared underneath the listing, including one which gave it a five star rating and described it as a 'great source of classified information'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It follows claims that at least three terror groups plotting attacks against Britain have changed their communication methods since the leaks by Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Al Qaeda-linked networks have altered their tactics since the fugitive stole intelligence files from GCHQ and the US National Security Agency, according to a report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Extremist websites have also moved to protect their digital communications by releasing encryption programmes for followers, making it harder for extremists to be tracked down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Evidence of the harm done to intelligence agencies across the world after the former CIA contractor leaked 1.7million classified documents in 2013 is compiled in the first comprehensive public analysis of the leaks by the Henry Jackson Society security think-tank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Snowden files revealed details about covert attempts by agencies to view citizens' private information by gathering internet histories, emails, text and call records and passwords.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Now the Henry Jackson Society has found that at least three Al Qaeda affiliates are known to have altered their communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The think-tank has also found other groups using human couriers instead of email and mobile phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Jihadist websites also released three 'significant' encryption programmes 'within a three- to five-month time frame of the leaks', meaning fanatics are harder to detect and encrypted emails take longer to decipher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Report author Robin Simcox said: 'The focus has been about the so-called mass surveillance by GCHQ and the NSA but these leaks have allowed extremist groups and jihadists to look at our capabilities - what we can and can't do - which has given them a great insight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'At a time when the range of threats against the West has never been greater, with Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Al Qaeda in Pakistan, it is astonishing the focus has been more on the shortcomings of our intelligence agencies and not the fact Snowden has helped terror suspects drop off the radar.</td></tr>
