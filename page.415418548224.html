<h3>'No one spared' as Israeli sketch show skewers candidates</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This is the secret behind Netanyahu's political longevity as portrayed by Eretz Nehederet, Israel's favourite sketch show which has been revelling in the run-up to next week's general election when the Israeli leader is seeking a third consecutive term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The programme -- whose title translates as "A Wonderful Country" -- has been running on Israeli prime time for 12 seasons, its tongue-in-cheek approach bringing some much-needed comic relief to the often dour world of Israeli politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it is in the run-up to the March 17 vote that the show has struck upon its greatest inspiration yet: "Bibi" Netanyahu himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's a lot of responsibility to play the prime minister," says Mariano Idelman, who portrays the Israeli leader on the show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Me, I have to respect him. The writers, not so much."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is not only Netanyahu who receives a weekly skewering in this madcap, half-hour rumpus of news and slapstick comedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Everyone is targeted. The left, the right... no one is spared," says actress Shani Cohen, who plays centrist candidate Tzipi Livni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In its studios in northern Tel Aviv, hundreds of fans scramble to take selfies with lookalikes of Livni, Netanyahu and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He plays the host interviewer, a serious foil putting questions to the "politicians" who respond with farce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are taken very seriously, people watch us as if they were watching a news programme," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu's purple-grey comb-over, Livni's plummy diction and far-right leader Naftali Bennett's refrain of "That's enough!" are all well-known to audiences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Eretz Nehederet's producers say the first episode of the latest season drew in nearly 30 percent of television audiences, a viewing figure most candidates could only dream of attracting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The show has become so popular that real-life politicians are starting to get in on the parody act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Netanyahu released a wry campaign video in which he sits on a sofa eating popcorn as he takes care of a young couple's children, portraying himself as the nation's "Bibi-sitter".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And Jewish Home weighed in with a clip in which Bennett wanders around Tel Aviv as a bearded hipster who is constantly apologising to everyone around him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>While the show's writers admit to being impressed by the self-deprecation of some of Israel's most senior politicians, they aren't concerned about losing their jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Don't worry; we're still better than them," says producer Muli Segev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Firstly, we're more fun. And you can't forget that their primary role is to run the country. Unlike us, they haven't really done their job in recent years," he adds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This explains the show's narrative of the Netanyahu curse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Sabotaging crucial US ties, engaging in wars and "ruining" Israeli democracy are all part of an effort to break the spell -- by becoming "the worst prime minister in the history of Israel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>During a visit to Jerusalem in 2013, US President Barack Obama dismissed reports of a dispute between him and his "friend Bibi" as "a plot to find something to feed Eretz Nehederet".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Back in the studio, nothing is sacred, with the set including replicas of the concrete wall separating Israel from the West Bank, a plastic anti-missile system and mock-ups of smuggling tunnels in Gaza -- all set up around the talk show table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We see Israel as a bubble which is trying to lead a quiet life in a region in turmoil by hiding from the Palestinians behind a wall and hiding from Hamas under Iron Dome," says Segev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"This is also what our wonderful country is about."</td></tr>
