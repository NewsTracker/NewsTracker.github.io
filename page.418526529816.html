<h3>'Authoritarian' treatment of Greece by European Union has been toxic for solidarity in Europe: pro-EU lobby group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>London: The bulldozing of Greece in bailout talks has been toxic for European solidarity and will bolster the 'No' vote in Britain's referendum next year on EU membership, a pro-EU lobby group has warned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The strict new austerity regime, and loss of control over its own finances, imposed on Greece as conditions of a third financial bailout have energised nationalist and Eurosceptic voices across the continent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The last few weeks have laid totally bare the European Union's brand of authoritarian dogma," UKIP leader Nigel Farage wrote in the London Telegraph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"More and more people are waking up to the dangers of this supranational beast sweeping aside national sovereignty completely. Many who had continued to believe until very recently that the EU was compassionate and forward-looking are beginning to realise just how backwards the whole project is."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Farage was not the only nationalist politician to attack the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pablo Echenique, a deputy from Spain's radical left Podemos, labelled the deal a "financial coup d'etat" that converted Greece into a protectorate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Podemos leader Juan Carlos Monedero said it was "a terrorist crime".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis warned the deal would strengthen the far right Golden Dawn party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Beppe Grillo, leader of Italy's anti-euro Five Star party said eurozone leaders had used a "strategy of terror", and Catarina Martins, leader of the Portugese anti-capitalist Left Bloc said "democracy has been completely swept aside to make way for colonial-style impositions".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Monday, the leader of France's National Front, Marine Le Pen, said if she were Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras she would have led Greece out of the Eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Greece is no longer free," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This is a carve-up to deprive the Greeks of their entire national heritage. It is clearly the enslavement of a country inside the European Union itself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Her deputy Florian Philippot said the Greek people had been "cast into slavery".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ms Le Pen had previously praised Greece's referendum on the bailout deal, pushing for her own referendum on the exit from the European Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The UK, under Conservative prime minister David Cameron, has already committed to a referendum on EU membership next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Until recently the 'Yes' vote was clearly in front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Peter Wilding, director of the British Influence group which is lobbying for Britain not to leave the EU, said if Greece accepted the deal offered by Europe it would "essentially be voting itself to be a ward of the Eurozone".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Though it might make economic sense, the politics were "grim", Mr Wilding said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The price of ceding sovereignty and apparently bypassing democracy is a high one for Greece but also a gift for the No campaign here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Whether you support German rigour or Greek pluck, it is clear that the consequences for continental solidarity have been toxic. The longer the crisis has dragged on, the more it has corroded Europe's political culture and revealed the shallowness of any sense of political solidarity across the continent and the limited legitimacy of the EU's political institutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The gloomy predictions of the late German-British sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf, who said before it started in 1999 that economic and monetary union would split rather than unite Europe, have become reality."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He predicted that 'No' vote promoters would look to equate the EU with the "democracy-eating" Eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>As if to prove his point, on Tuesday the anti-Europe Daily Express ran a column attacking the deal, and the EU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Deputy editor Michael Booker wrote that "Europe, and more importantly the EU, is looking weaker than it has done for years".</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Germany's bullying of the Greeks is cutting through and making some previously EU-neutral voters, such as myself, think again," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"[German chancellor Angela] Merkel's demands have left a nasty impression that could be a telling weapon for those leading the campaign to leave the EU."</td></tr>
