<h3>German investor confidence inches higher but Greece, Ukraine concerns hold back sentiment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ZEW institute said Tuesday that its monthly confidence index, which measures investors' economic outlook for the next half-year, crept up to 54.8 points for March from 53 in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That's a 13-month high but is below economists' forecast of an increase to 60.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The German economy, Europe's biggest, is in robust shape and Frankfurt's DAX index of blue chip stocks has hit a string of record highs in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, ZEW president Clemens Fuest said that a lack of progress in resolving the Greek crisis and the Ukrainian conflict "has a dampening effect on sentiment."</td></tr>
