<h3>Israel election: Benjamin Netanyahu may be on his way out</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tel Aviv: In 1996, a canny and polished politician named Benjamin Netanyahu stormed onto the electoral scene and became Israel's youngest prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An articulate and commanding presence, fluent in English, twice wounded in combat, he became a political force of nature, never far from the spotlight - or the minds of his rivals - even during the few years when he was out of power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Now, however, voters may finally be turning away from the 65-year-old leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Trailing in the polls as he heads into Tuesday's general elections, the Prime Minister has acknowledged he is in danger of being dislodged, though the famously mercurial Israeli electorate may yet make a last-minute swerve, and the vagaries of Israel's complicated political system are likely to cloud the outcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israeli co-leaders of the Zionist Union list, Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, at the party headquarters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Candidates crisscrossed the country on Sunday, making impassioned eleventh-hour appeals in what has turned into one of the hardest-fought campaigns in modern Israeli history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For Mr Netanyahu's main competition, a centre-left party known as the Zionist Union, the message was simple: It's time for the Prime Minister to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The public has had enough of Netanyahu," said Isaac Herzog, the soft-spoken and scholarly lawyer-politician who morphed into the driven candidate now seen as the likeliest contender to lead the country if Mr Netanyahu's Likud Party falls short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The public wants change."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Polls appeared to bear him out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the last surveys released before a "poll blackout" took effect at the end of last week, nearly three-quarters of the respondents said the country needed a change of course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But if the country's longest-serving prime minister since founding father David Ben-Gurion is on his way out, he is definitely not going without a fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a series of sharply combative interviews, Mr Netanyahu depicted his rivals - Mr Herzog and running mate Tzipi Livni, a former foreign affairs minister and peace negotiator -as weak and naive, asserting they would make extraordinary concessions to Palestinians and fail to safeguard Israel against a nuclear Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Buji and Tzipi will run straight to Ramallah," the Prime Minister thundered in an interview on Sunday on Israel Radio, calling Mr Herzog by his widely used nickname as he referred to the West Bank city that is the Palestinian Authority's home base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They will capitulate immediately ... They cannot withstand international pressure, and don't want to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Although the final burst of electioneering has taken on the tenor of high drama, commentators of all political stripes were nearly unanimous in their assessment that the vote is unlikely to result in a decisive victory for either side, because of Israel's intricately wrought system of coalition governance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Zionist Union and Likud are the two largest among 26 political parties contesting the election, and it is virtually impossible for either one to achieve a majority in the 120-seat parliament, or Knesset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They must woo coalition partners, a process that can at times resemble a delicate minuet and at others a barroom brawl, and which can take weeks to yield a result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It is usually the leader of the biggest vote-getting party who heads the government, but not always.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In 2013, Ms Livni's Kadima party bested Mr Netanyahu's by a single seat, but she was unable to muster enough support for a workable coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Netanyahu was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If the Zionist Union wins this election, she and Mr Herzog have agreed to rotate the prime minister's post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rivals can end up teaming up to form a "unity government" - which tends to struggle under the weight of internal contradictions - but Mr Netanyahu has said he would not enter into such an arrangement, and the Zionist Union, having made calls for his ouster a centrepiece of its election platform, might find it awkward to then court him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's seemingly flustered demeanour in the campaign's waning days was a far cry from three short months ago, when he summarily fired cabinet ministers he deemed insubordinate, in effect dissolving his coalition and precipitating elections, which are being held two years ahead of schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>At the time, the Prime Minister's camp appeared confident he would win a mandate that would allow him to form a more conservative coalition without the presence of overt opponents in his government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In hindsight, some observers said, that appears to have been a potentially fatal political miscalculation, a gamble founded both on hubris and a serious underestimation of popular discontent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A key early indicator of growing public restiveness was a grass-roots social-issues campaign that sprang up in 2011, galvanising nationwide demonstrations over the high cost of living and unleashing new political forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Soaring housing costs, in particular, became a prominent issue in this campaign, but Mr Netanyahu infuriated many voters by appearing to brush off their concerns in favour of a relentless focus on the Iranian nuclear threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Voters turning their backs on Mr Netanyahu and the Likud are likelier to migrate to centrist or right-leaning parties rather than the Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>One such party, the centrist Kulanu, is forecast to be a kingmaker in coalition negotiations, but has not said which bloc it would support.</td></tr>

<h3>'Furious 7': SXSW Review</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The knowledge of his death in a November 2013 car accident colors our experience of this unintentional swan song in many ways, of course, but viewers trying to spot the scenes in which stand-ins and CGI played Walker's part for him will find it hard enough that they may do the right thing: Stop trying, and instead go along with a reworked screenplay that ushers him off the stage with as much grace as any other development in this muscle-car melodrama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Technical miracles aside, the nature of the story makes watching Furious 7 something of a morbid game: Over and over, the action puts Walker's Brian O'Conner in such jeopardy that we think, "Ah, this will be the scene where they give him a heroic death."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But saying "over and over" acknowledges that Brian survives, at least, the bomb blast that nearly kills his family in one fell swoop, that he manages to get out of that big bus hanging precariously over a cliff, and that he, and for that matter all his pals, drive their cars out of a plane in midair and parachute to the ground without so much as denting a fender.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But producer Neal H. Moritz, who introduced the super-last-minute screening at South by Southwest, begged the audience to keep mum about Brian's fate, so we won't provide an exhaustive list of the many certain-death situations he faces and survives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tired yet?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>You will be after two hours of F7, which is as overinflated, if not as well formed, as the physique of Dwayne Johnson, who gave this ensemble a much-needed charisma boost when he signed on in episode five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Alas, Johnson is sidelined for much of this installment, laid up in a bodycast after saving a co-worker from an exploding building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Don't worry, kids, the Rock will be back for the climax, reentering the action with the words "Daddy's gotta go to work."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That is Wildean wit compared to most of Chris Morgan's unrepentantly dumb pulp dialogue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Fast & Furious fans don't come out to critique lines like "Let's do this," they come to see a red sports car (one so expensive only seven were made) be stolen from a billionaire's Abu Dhabi penthouse; to watch it bust through his windows, fly through the air, and crash into the skyscraper next door (landing safely, of course) only to learn that the brakes have gone out, and it will have to take to the skies again into a third building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Anyone who can buy that bit of computer-generated idiocy should have no trouble believing Paul Walker is in this film from start to finish.</td></tr>
