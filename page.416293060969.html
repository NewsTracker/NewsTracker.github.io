<h3>Hillary Clinton heads to New Hampshire after Iowa kickoff</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>US presidential contender Hillary Clinton will visit the key primary election state of New Hampshire early next week, after her first presidential election trip this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The former first lady and secretary of state -- now the clear frontrunner for the Democratic Party presidential ticket -- will meet with students, teachers and small business employees, he campaign team said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This means the tour of the northeastern US state will be similar to one Clinton made through Iowa this week to formally kick off her campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>During Clinton's swing through New Hampshire, the 67-year-old will also meet privately with the state's elected officials and group leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Iowa and New Hampshire are the first states to hold preliminary elections within the country's two major parties to determine the two main challengers to contend for the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Results in the states can set the tone for the rest of a candidate's campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>During the 2008 Democratic primary -- that would eventually be won by current president Barack Obama -- the former first lady lost badly to Obama in Iowa before turning the tide a few days later in New Hampshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This time around, there is so far no serious rival to Clinton among the Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After announcing her candidacy Sunday, Clinton made an effort to reach out to small-town Americans, starting her US tour with a van ride to Iowa from New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If she wins the Democratic primary and the eventual national election Clinton would become the first woman president in the history of the US in January 2017.</td></tr>
