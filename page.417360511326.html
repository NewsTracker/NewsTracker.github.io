<h3>Greek bank deposits fall to lowest in more than a decade</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greek bank deposits have fallen to their lowest in more than a decade, new statistics show, as Greeks worried about their new government's painfully slow negotiations with creditors withdraw savings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Figures from the European Central Bank published Friday showed more than 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) were withdrawn in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That leaves household deposits at the end of the month at 139.4 billion euros ($151.9 billion), down from 145 billion euros in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The figure is the lowest since November 2004, when deposits stood at 137.2 billion euros.</td></tr>
