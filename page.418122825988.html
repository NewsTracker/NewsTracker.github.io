<h3>Boy Scout dies in flash flood while camping in New Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Boy Scout on a camping trip with his troop in northern New Mexico died Saturday after he and three other teens were swept away in a flash flood, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The teen was one of eight Boy Scouts participating in a 12-day trek at the Philmont Scout Ranch when the flooding hit, New Mexico State Police spokesman Chad Pierce said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The boys ranged in age from 14 to 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They were accompanied by three adult crew leaders and a scout ranger employed by the ranch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pierce said floodwaters came through North Ponil Canyon, where they were camping, around 4:30 a.m. He said the water over-ran their camp site, taking the four boys down the canyon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ranch employees immediately sprang into action and were able to rescue three of the boys, Pierce said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>State Police were called around 9:30 a.m. and a search and rescue team found the other teen about an hour-and-a-half later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His body was recovered roughly a mile from where he was swept away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Authorities are not releasing the teen's identity pending family notification.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Philmont Scout Ranch, which is located in Cimarron roughly 50 miles south of the Colorado state line, bills itself as a top destination for "high adventure" and training for the Boy Scouts of America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Comprised of more than 200 square miles, the facility offers Scouts opportunities to learn about camping, rock climbing and other activities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>According to the ranch, about 20,000 Scouts visit Philmont annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a statement posted to its website, Philmont Ranch called the death a "very difficult time for our entire Scouting family" and expressed sympathy for the teen's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and we are supporting them in any way that we can," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"At Philmont we strive to provide a safe and inspiring setting for Scouts to experience the natural environment of northern New Mexico and seek to protect both Scouts and wildlife."</td></tr>
