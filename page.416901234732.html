<h3>Ukraine port of Mariupol braces for war</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A pro-Russian separatist stands guard at a check point on the road to Mariupol in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mariupol: Ukraine's eastern port of Mariupol is bracing for an attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Army vehicles rumble down streets, windows are fortified to shield against shell damage and signs pasted to apartment blocks point people to their nearest bomb shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Locals fear pro-Russian separatists will unleash an assault on their city now that President Vladimir Putin has finished hosting world leaders to mark the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukraine's armoured personnel carriers en route to a front-line position east of Mariupol in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Everyone's talking about it," said Iryna Hrynko, 40, a designer who arrived last year after fleeing the rebels' Donetsk stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Friends back home even tell me about an attack".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An industrial hub of half a million people, Mariupol sits on the fringe of Ukraine's year-long insurgency, which has killed more than 6000 people and ruined Russia's ties with its Cold War foes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An attack would bury the latest Minsk truce brokered by Russia and Germany and risk more sanctions for Mr Putin's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It could also reignite calls to arm Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If a new attack takes place, the Minsk agreements will be ultimately dead, and a new initiative at negotiating a lasting settlement - in whatever format - is unlikely for longer", said Joerg Forbrig, senior program director at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The US and several European Union countries will see a renewed debate on lethal arms supplies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ahead of a peace summit, Ukrainian government forces launch a counter-offensive near Mariupol in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sitting just 25 kilometres from rebel positions, between Russia and the Crimean peninsula Mr Putin annexed last March, locals see reasons to be scared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In Mariupol's outskirts, shelling is frequently heard from the nearby town of Shyrokyne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Military personnel flood the city, building defensive positions and bunkers and blocking approach roads with huge concrete blocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Visitors arriving by bus must clear multiple checkpoints where searches can take hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While Russia blames Ukraine for breaking the truce, US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter said last week that the separatists may be readying a new offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>International monitors saw the truce's worst shelling in Shyrokyne in late April, saying rebels had amassed tanks and howitzers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They warned that an attempt to take Mariupol risked "disastrous consequences" for diplomatic efforts to end the crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ukrainian servicemen put their dogs under the jackets to stay warm in Mariupol in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>To prepare for the worst, Ukraine's army is giving classes at schools and universities and taking people on training drills, said Dmytro Horbunov, a military spokesman in Mariupol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We have enough people to defend the city," he said, citing the presence of thousands of troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Fortifications are built day and night. The front line is completely improved."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Donetsk rebels will eventually seize Mariupol, according to their leader Alexander Zakharchenko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"It's easy to outflank it and they'll surrender," he said in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Don't forget, our mothers and sisters live there".</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>President Petro Poroshenko has said the rebels may attack in the second half of May and has threatened martial law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>An assault would probably bring stiffer EU and US penalties for Russia, which denies involvement in the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>If the truce isn't met "and there are crass violations - as in Mariupol - then we'll have to speak about further sanctions", Ms Merkel said in March.</td></tr>
