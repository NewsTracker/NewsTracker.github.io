<h3>Drag queens, Native Americans and others protest Facebook's 'real name' policy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MENLO PARK -- Decked out in feathers, face paint and plenty of sparkle, San Francisco drag queens along with Native Americans, domestic violence survivors and others came to Facebook's headquarters Monday with a familiar message -- change a rule that requires the site's users to prove their identities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Hey, hey. Ho ho. Facebook's policy got to go," more than 50 protesters chanted as they pumped their fists in the air and held up picket signs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook said it requires that users provide their "authentic identity" because it holds people accountable for what they say online, protecting people from harassment and cyberbullying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Leading the crowd Mutha Chucka, in pink, as they walk back to bus after protest on a rule that requires Facebook users provide their real names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the corner of Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>, Calif., on Monday, May 31, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Drag queens and the LGBT community, who use pseudonyms on their Facebook accounts, say people are reporting to Facebook that they are not using an "authentic identity," causing them to get locked out of their accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"People can be assured that they're really connecting with their loved ones, and no one can hide behind an anonymous name to bully, taunt or say insensitive or inappropriate things," Justin Osofsky, Facebook's vice president of global operations, and Monika Bickert, the company's head of product policy, wrote in a post Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But drag queens, Native Americans, domestic violence survivors and others said the rule has the opposite effect, with some people reporting them to Facebook for not using an "authentic identity," causing them to get locked out of their accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They are only able to get back into their accounts if they are able to prove their identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It is malicious and targeted bullying against our community and all of those users," Sister Roma said during Monday's protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Protesters heard from other drag queens, civil rights activists, politicians and others who started voicing their concerns about the rule last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Facebook, which publicly apologized in October to the LGBT community, said it responded by clarifying that the site does not require a legal name and allowing for more ways and time for people to verify their identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But protesters aren't satisfied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They want Facebook to remove the option that allows people to report a fake name, stop asking users to verify their identities and provide an easier way to get in touch with the company if that doesn't fix the problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sadaisha Shimmers, a San Francisco civil rights activist, said she changed her name when she was 17 years old after she was bullied for being gay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It's about silencing people who should have the right to have a voice online," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We are all human beings and we all deserve the right to identify and be called whatever we want."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Those against the "real name" policy also created an online petition asking San Francisco Pride Parade organizers to bar the social networking company from participating in the June celebration, but that request was denied by the board of directors on May 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lil Miss Hot Mess said that Monday's protest was only the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Facebook's policy is just the tip of the iceberg," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"This is part of a bigger fight for our digital rights, for our rights to our privacy, to our safety and to express ourselves authentically online."</td></tr>
