<h3>Donald Trump called for jury duty</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington (CNN)It's a good thing Donald Trump has his own jet -- because he's been summoned for jury duty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rhona Graff, senior vice president to the president of The Trump Organization, confirmed Friday that Trump has been called for jury duty in Manhattan, and that the mogul will report on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Trump is currently on the campaign trail, including a scheduled appearance at the Iowa State Fair on Saturday, where he'll offer helicopter rides on his personal chopper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier this summer, the New York Daily News reported that Trump had ignored five jury summons over nine years, but a $250 fine would be erased when he shows up on Aug. 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Former President George W. Bush reported for jury duty last week, but he was not picked to serve on a case.</td></tr>
