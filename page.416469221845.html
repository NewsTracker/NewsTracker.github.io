<h3>Google lavishes chairman with $109 million pay package</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Most of the compensation consisted of stock valued at $100 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</td></tr>
