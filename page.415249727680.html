<h3>Islamic State militants bulldoze ancient Nimrud city</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A tribal source from the nearby city of Mosul told Reuters the ultra-radical Sunni Islamists, who dismiss Iraq's pre-Islamic heritage as idolatrous, had pillaged the 3,000-year-old site on the banks of the Tigris river, once capital of the world's most powerful empire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The assault against Nimrud came just a week after the release of a video showing Islamic State supporters smashing museum statues and carvings in Mosul, the city they seized along with much of northern Iraq last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mobile users, please click here to watch the video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The United Nations cultural agency UNESCO condemned Islamic State's actions as "cultural cleansing" and a war crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government in Baghdad said the fighters were defying "the will of the world and the feelings of humanity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In a new crime in their series of reckless offences they assaulted the ancient city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy machinery, appropriating archaeological attractions dating back 13 centuries BC," the tourism and antiquities ministry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nimrud, about 20 miles (30 km) south of Mosul, was built around 1250 BC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Four centuries later it became capital of the neo-Assyrian empire - at the time the most powerful state on earth, extending to modern-day Egypt, Turkey and Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Many of its most famous surviving monuments were removed years ago by archaeologists, including colossal Winged Bulls which are now in London's British Museum and hundreds of precious stones and pieces of gold which were moved to Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But ruins of the ancient city remain at the northern Iraqi site, excavated by a series of experts since the 19th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>British archaeologist Max Mallowan and his wife, crime writer Agatha Christie, worked at Nimrud in the 1950s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Islamic State members came to the Nimrud archaeological city and looted the valuables in it and then they proceeded to level the site to the ground," the Mosul tribal source told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Archaeologists have compared the assault on Iraq's cultural history to the Taliban's destruction of Afghanistan's giant Bamiyan Buddha statues in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the damage being wreaked by Islamic State, not just to ancient monuments but also on some Muslim places of worship, is even more relentless and wide-ranging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"This is yet another attack against the Iraqi people, reminding us that nothing is safe from the cultural cleansing underway in the country," said UNESCO chief Irina Bokova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The deliberate destruction of cultural heritage constitutes a war crime," Bokova said, describing Iraq's history as "the heritage of the whole of humanity".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Last week's video showed fighters toppling statues and carvings from plinths in the Mosul museum and smashing them with sledgehammers and drills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It also showed damage to a huge statue of a bull at the Nergal Gate into the city of Nineveh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Archaeologists said it was hard to quantify the damage; although some items appeared to be replicas, many priceless articles had been destroyed including artifacts from Hatra, a stunning pillared city in northern Iraq dating back 2,000 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Iraq's senior Shi'ite cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani called on the country's deeply divided religious and ethnic groups to come together to fight Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Day after day, the need is proven for everyone to unite and fight this ferocious organization that spares neither man nor stone," Sistani said in a Friday sermon delivered by an aide in the southern city of Kerbala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Iraqi forces and Shi'ite militia supported by Shi'ite Iran have launched an offensive to drive Islamic State from the northern city of Tikrit and could move on Mosul later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A U.S.-led coalition is also mounting air strikes against the fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Iraqi officials said last week that Islamic State had kept many artifacts to sell to antiquities smugglers and raise revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A prominent politician from Iraq's Assyrian Christian community, some of whose members still speak the Aramaic language of Jesus, told Reuters on Friday that the destruction at Nimrud was aimed at covering up the fact that the militants had stolen and sold many pieces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Yonadam Kanna described them as "an ignorant, backward gang that seeks to erase the collective memory of Iraq and its culture and heritage".</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Modern day Iraq was one of the birthplaces of civilization, with agriculture and writing pioneered on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers more than 5,000 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Many of the cities and empires mentioned in the bible's Old Testament were in what is now northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In the south, sheltered from Islamic State depredation but still damaged by years of conflict and theft, lie Babylon - site of Nebuchadnezzar's Hanging Gardens - Ur, birthplace of the Biblical patriarch Abraham, and the imperial capitals of Arab and Iranian empires in Samarra, Baghdad and Ctesiphon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Islamic State, which rules a self-declared caliphate in north Iraq and eastern Syria, promotes a fiercely purist interpretation of Sunni Islam, rejecting religious shrines of any sort and condemning Iraq's majority Shi'ites as heretics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In July it destroyed the tomb of the prophet Jonah in Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It has also attacked Shi'ite places of worship and has ordered non-Muslims to convert, pay a tax or face the sword.</td></tr>

<h3>Michael Brown's family to file civil lawsuit against Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It comes a day after the U.S. Justice Department refused to prosecute Wilson despite compiling a 350,000-page report on racial profiling in the Missouri city that 'led to' Brown's fatal shooting at the hands of a white police officer on August 9, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>'He did not have to kill Michael Brown,' attorney Daryl Parks said of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his father, Michael Brown Sr., attended the news conference at Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church, but they did not speak nor take questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He did not say specifically when the suit would be filed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The announcement is a reaction to the news on Wednesday that federal investigators found a pattern of discriminatory and illegal actions against African-Americans by the Ferguson Police Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The report said police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson overwhelmingly arrested and issued citations to blacks to boost city revenues through fines and court fees, creating a culture of distrust that exploded on August 9 when Wilson killed Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Attorney General Eric Holder said the report showed police created a 'highly toxic environment' in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'Let me be clear, this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the Ferguson Police Department or in any department in the city of Ferguson,' the city's mayor James Knowles said at the conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The mayor did not take any questions at the presser, and though Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson had been expected to attend, no explanation was given for his absence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Justice Department investigation into Ferguson police began immediately after Brown's killing in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, an unnamed department official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Department of Justice report also found that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>According to figures recorded between 2012 and 2014, blacks were also twice as likely to be searched than whites during traffic stops, though contraband showed up more during searches of white drivers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of African Americans in Ferguson, New York and Cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what President Barack Obama called 'simmering distrust' between police and communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops, compared to their white counterparts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Justice Department plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with Ferguson officials and enter a consent decree, or to sue the city to force change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Brown was unarmed when he was shot multiple times by Wilson, who told investigators he and Brown had an angry and violent encounter, causing him to fear for his life when he shot Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Wilson, who has since left the police department.</td></tr>
