<h3>Bruins fire GM Chiarelli 4 years after Stanley Cup (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chiarelli was hired in 2006, and he assembled the team that beat the Vancouver Canucks for the 2011 NHL championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Bruins returned to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2013, and last year they had the best regular-season record in the league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But this year they were eliminated from the playoff race on the final day of the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''His efforts undoubtedly helped the team achieve great success during his tenure and he helped restore the proud tradition of Boston Bruins hockey,'' Bruins President Cam Neely said in a statement.</td></tr>
