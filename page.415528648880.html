<h3>Cervantes remains found in Madrid convent, investigators believe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Forensic archaeologist Francisco Etxeberria (C), historian Francisco Marin (R) and forensic anthropologist Almudena Garcia speak about the search of the remains of Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes in Madrid March 17, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish scientists said on Tuesday that remains found under a Madrid convent are likely to include those of "Don Quixote" author Miguel de Cervantes, one of the world's most celebrated writers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nearly 400 years after his death, the quest to find Cervantes had led investigators deep into the sub-soil of a 17th century convent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some of bones dug up in recent months almost certainly belong to the writer, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We believe that some of the remains of Miguel de Cervantes are among the fragments," forensic anthropologist Francisco Etxeberria told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Investigators may never be able to guarantee with absolute certainty that it was his body and DNA tests would be tricky, the experts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cervantes had a sister who is buried near Madrid, but only tiny bone fragments remain of her body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cervantes - whose masterpiece about an errant, daydreaming knight and his faithful servant Sancho Panza has delighted readers around the world - had requested to be buried in the convent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He died in 1616 - the same week as William Shakespeare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the exact location of his tomb was lost in a subsequent rebuilding of the convent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Historians hope to establish a burial site for Cervantes, considered the father of the modern novel, to attract literary pilgrims and tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Madrid mayor Ana Botella said on Tuesday that authorities were looking into the possibility of opening up the site to visitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Investigators began their search almost a year ago in the cloistered baroque convent, still home to a dozen elderly nuns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They recently found bone fragments and as well as a dilapidated piece of a wooden coffin with the letters "M" and "C" on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>None of the bones showed signs of the injuries Cervantes was known to have sustained during his life, including lesions to his left arm when he fought in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the experts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Cervantes search takes place after a similar quest in Britain, where investigators found the remains of medieval monarch King Richard III in 2012 under municipal car park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He will be reburied in a ceremony next week.</td></tr>

<h3>Four years of conflict in Syria, and commitment to gender equality at the CSW in New York</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Five countries host 97% of Syria's refugees - Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>We marked the anniversary with a look at the where Syrians fleeing the conflict have gone, and met 19-year-old Younis, who explained what life is like in Jordan's Za'atari refugee camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>We also featured an interactive with the stories of nine Syrians who fled to Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The group spoke movingly about adjusting to their new lives, including performing in a reimagined version of Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte alongside German opera singers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>World leaders and women's rights campaigners are gathered in New York for the UN's Commission on the Status of Women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Government ministers opened proceedings by declaring their commitment to achieving gender equality by 2030, but the wording of the declaration was a point of contention for many women's rights activists, who branded it bland and unambitious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The declaration also followed research that revealed how constitutions in 170 countries prevent women from experiencing equal rights and opportunities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As leaders gather in Sendai, Japan, for the world conference on disaster risk reduction, professors Julian Hunt and Joy Pereira outlined the importance of sharing scientific advances in disaster prediction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile, peace and security expert Sheelagh Stewart argued why the UK's aid watchdog was right to criticise DfID over its law and justice operations, and Cordaid CEO Simone Filippini called for leaders to address the "woeful underfunding" of efforts to promote women in peace-building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>We'll take a closer look at the millennium development goal on gender equality, which aimed to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, boost the share of women in wage employment and increase the number of women holding seats in national parliaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As the September deadline approaches, what progress has been made on these targets, and what remains to be done?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Stay tuned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This tough negotiation at Commission on the Status of Women is a reminder of how much further the world has to go to really deliver the ambition of a world where all men and women, boys and girls are equal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The struggle to agree on strong, transformative statements that unequivocally support gender equality and women's rights is perhaps a sign of the imbalance in decision-making at the UN - where still today only 15 out of 193 member states are lead by women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>More women in power, at this level of decision-making, would lead to better outcomes for women and girls, and as a result for the whole of society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Development Progress: Where will all the jobs come from?</td></tr>
