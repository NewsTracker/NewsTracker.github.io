<h3>Interpol Halts Use of FIFA Funds for Anticorruption Program</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON - Interpol suspended an agreement with FIFA on Friday that had called for the international police agency to receive 20 million euros over 10 years to fight corruption in soccer, citing the American investigations that have ensnared soccer's world governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pietro Calcaterra, a spokesman for Interpol, confirmed that since 2011, Interpol, which has a staff of more than 800 and describes itself as the world's largest international police organization, has been augmenting its annual budget - about 80 million, or about $90 million, last year - by turning to the private sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The four-year-old deal had raised doubts about the risks of a conflict of interest and questions about whether it was appropriate for Interpol to accept millions of euros from FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sepp Blatter was re-elected to a fourth term as FIFA's leader in 2011 just weeks after the agreement was signed, raising questions about whether he had used the deal to try to deflect accusations about corruption that have long swirled around his organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr. Calcaterra declined to comment immediately on the concerns about any conflict of interest that might have been generated by the agreement with FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In May 2011, FIFA agreed to provide about $23 million over 10 years to support the Integrity in Sport program run by Interpol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The program is meant to provide training and education to prevent fraud and corruption in soccer, including match-fixing and illegal betting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The contribution was described at the time as the biggest-ever private donation to Interpol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Interpol said in a statement on Friday that the organization would "freeze the use of financial contributions from FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the statement, Interpol's secretary general, Jurgen Stock, said the decision had been taken "in light of the current context surrounding FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"All external partners, whether public or private, must share the fundamental values and principles of the organization," Mr. Stock added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The statement also lauded the anticorruption program for helping the agency's efforts across its 190 member countries to "prevent the manipulation of sporting events and illegal gambling by criminal groups."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Also on Friday, the Vatican suspended the acceptance of charitable donations from Conmebol, the South American soccer confederation, The Associated Press reported, because the confederation is under scrutiny in the American investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>FIFA said in a statement on Friday that it was disappointed by Interpol's decision, and warned that the move would have negative consequences in the fight against criminal activity in soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Interpol issued wanted-person alerts on June 3 for two former senior FIFA officials and four corporate executives, one day after Mr. Blatter announced that he would resign after 17 years as the body's president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Interpol alerts, issued at the request of the United States, included a former FIFA vice president, Jack Warner, a soccer official from Trinidad and Tobago who has been accused of accepting bribes in connection with the decision to award the hosting of the 2010 World Cup to South Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Interpol's website notes that its principle source of funding comes from contributions provided by its 190 member states, including the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But donors have also included the pharmaceutical, tobacco and technology industries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The top 10 donors to Interpol last year included FIFA and the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee, whose successful bid to host the World Cup is part of a separate corruption inquiry in Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Other big donors include the tobacco giant Philip Morris International, which joined forces with Interpol to combat the trafficking of illicit goods, including the smuggling of counterfeit cigarettes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When the deal with Interpol was announced, FIFA said it was a "milestone" that would enhance the global effort to fight corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The threat of match-fixing in sport is a major one, and we are committed to doing everything in our power to tackle this threat," Mr. Blatter said in a statement at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on June 13, 2015, on page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | Soccer; Interpol Ends FIFA Deal.</td></tr>
