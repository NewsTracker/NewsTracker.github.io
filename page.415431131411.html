<h3>Clinton takes campaign step with New Hampshire hiring</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton conceded that she should have used a government email to conduct business as secretary of state, saying her decision was simply a matter of "convenience."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - In a direct step toward a run for the presidency, Hillary Rodham Clinton is hiring political staff to guide her Democratic primary efforts in the early voting state of New Hampshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The team-in-waiting is made up of senior operatives in Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's successful re-election bid in 2014, when she survived a Republican wave that knocked out many other Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mike Vlacich, Shaheen's campaign manager, will serve as Clinton's state director, said a New Hampshire Democrat with knowledge of the move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because people will not be officially hired until Clinton announces a campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton is expected to announce her 2016 White House bid in the next few weeks, a race that presents few primary rivals at this point, in contrast to the crowded Republican contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The former secretary of state has been trying to dig out from a controversy over her use of a private email account and server after acknowledging days ago that she should have avoided relying exclusively on personal email while at the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Word of her hirings in New Hampshire came as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, expected to be a leading contender for the Republican nomination, is in the state on his first visit in years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In addition to Vlacich, Clinton is turning to Kari Thurman, Shaheen's political director, and Harrell Kirstein, Shaheen's campaign communications director, to serve in the same functions for her, the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Shaheen on Friday wished the three of them well "in their next venture," praised their service to her and described Vlacich as "a dedicated public servant and a brilliant political strategist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clinton won the 2008 New Hampshire primary and many prominent Democrats in the state are already backing her assumed campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Democrats recently told The Associated Press that she has begun retaining staff in the early voting states of Iowa and South Carolina as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Clinton returned to New Hampshire last fall for the first time since 2008, campaigning for Shaheen and Gov. Maggie Hassan before the 2014 midterm election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She and her husband, Bill, have maintained friendships and political alliances in New Hampshire that date to the early 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Vlacich emerged from the 2014 election as one of the most successful Democratic operatives in the country, helping Shaheen beat back a challenge from Republican Scott Brown, a former senator from Massachusetts, when Democrats lost competitive races across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Vlacich's wife, Liz Purdy, is also a Clinton confidante, serving as a top adviser to Clinton's 2008 bid in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Mike is the kind of person who can just pull activists together," said Peter Burling, a former Democratic National Committeeman from New Hampshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I think that's going to be an essential part of this next campaign, getting Democrats to come out and participate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Robby Mook, Clinton's likely campaign manager, also has ties to Shaheen, serving as her 2008 campaign chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In Iowa, Clinton's campaign is expected to be run by Matt Paul, a longtime adviser to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>South Carolina Democrats have told AP that Clinton will again hire Democratic consulting firm Sunrise Communications, owned by Darrell Jackson, a state senator and pastor.</td></tr>
