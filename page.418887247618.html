<h3>World Briefing: Nepal Temple Halts Animal Sacrifices</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A temple in southern Nepal known for the mass slaughter of animals at a festival every five years has indefinitely banned animal sacrifice, India's Humane Society International said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Millions of pilgrims from India and Nepal attend the festival at the Gadhimai temple about 90 miles south of Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to the Humane Society, about 500,000 buffaloes, goats, chickens and other animals were killed at the temple in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Those numbers dropped in 2014 after India's Supreme Court banned taking animals across the border to Nepal for sacrifice there, campaigners said.</td></tr>
