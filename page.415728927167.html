<h3>Cubs? Jackson blames Google Maps for missing start</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cubs righty Edwin Jackson speaks with catcher Miguel Montero during a relief appearance on March 24 in Mesa, Ariz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He missed his scheduled start because he couldn't find the A's ballpark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some pitchers have trouble finding the plate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Edwin Jackson of the Chicago Cubs had a much bigger problem: He couldn't find the ballpark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jackson missed his spring training start Tuesday against the A's when he drove to the wrong stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fitting, too - he once walked eight batters in a no-hitter, and has never been known for great location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jackson took the blame for this errant wind-up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 31-year-old veteran said he typed "Oakland Athletics spring training complex" into the Google Maps app on his phone and it directed him to Phoenix Municipal Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Too bad for Jackson, he didn't realize Oakland no longer played there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Instead, the A's moved out after last spring and now host games about 5 miles away at Hohokam Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It was my fault for not looking to see where it was," Jackson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Phoenix Muni, as the ballpark is called, is the current base for the Arizona State Sun Devils college team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So Jackson headed to Hohokam, which was the Cubs' longtime spring home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He eventually got to the right place, not that it helped him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He entered the game in the second inning and was tagged for eight runs and nine hits in only 1 2-3 innings of a 14-2 loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Jackson joins an ever-growing list of ballplayers to get lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A few years ago, a couple Cincinnati Reds went to Yankee Stadium when their game against the New York Mets was really at Citi Field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Roger Clemens once got mixed up trying to find Montreal's spring stadium in West Palm Beach, Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And perhaps Braves pitcher Pascual Perez faced the toughest jam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In 1982, after getting his driver's license earlier in the day, he famously spent two hours on I-285 circling the city, unable to figure out how to exit to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Jackson said his late arrival didn't cause his lousy results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I was already dressed and got here in time to get ready, but they didn't want me to rush things," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I came to the stadium with the mindset of being ready. It was a crazy way to start the day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>You buying Jackson's story?</td></tr>
