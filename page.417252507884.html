<h3>Audiard's 'Dheepan' wins Palme d'Or in upset Cannes finale</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Director Jacques Audiard holds the Palme d'Or award for the film Dheepan as he poses for photographers during a photo call following the awards ceremony at the 68th international film festival, Cannes, southern France, Sunday, May 24, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - The 68th Cannes Film Festival was brought to a surprising close Sunday with Jacques Audiard's Sri Lankan refugee drama taking the festival's coveted top honor, the Palme d'Or.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The choice of "Dheepan," as selected by a jury led by Joel and Ethan Coen, left some critics scratching their heads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While the dapper French filmmaker has drawn widespread acclaim for films such as "A Prophet" and "Rust and Bone," some critics were disappointed by the thriller climax of Audiard's film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Dheepan" is about a trio of Sri Lankans who pretend to be a family in order to flee their war-torn country and are settled in a violent housing project outside Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This isn't a jury of film critics," Joel Coen told reporters after the awards ceremony, alongside fellow jurors like Guillermo del Toro and Jake Gyllenhaal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is a jury of artists who are looking at the work."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The win for "Dheepan" comes at a time when Europe is particularly attuned to the experience of immigrants, following the recent deaths of hundreds crossing the Mediterranean, seeking Italian shores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jury members, though, said "Dheepan" was chosen for its overall strength as a film, rather than any topicality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We all thought it was a very beautiful movie," said Ethan Coen, calling the decision "swift."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Audiard, springing to the podium at the Palais des Festivals, accepted the award with warm gratitude, bowing to the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He was joined by the makeshift parents of his film: Kalieaswari Srinivasan and Antonythasan Jesuthasan, who himself was Tamil Tiger child soldier before finding political asylum in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"To receive a prize from the Coen brothers is exceptional," said Audiard, who added that only receiving one from the Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, the Belgian filmmaking siblings, could equal it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The runner-up prize, the Grand Prix, went to "Son of Saul," a grim Holocaust drama by first-time Hungarian director Laszlo Nemes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some expected Nemes' horrifying plunge into the life of an Auschwitz worker to take the top award, but it's been 26 years since a debut film (Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies, and Videotape") was given the Palme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>English actress Sienna Miller and Canadian actor Xavier Dolan, both jury members, sounded especially moved by "Son of Saul."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Miller called it "breathtaking" and an extraordinary accomplishment for a first-time filmmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Europe is still haunted by the destruction of the European Jews," said Nemes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"That's something that lives with us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Hou Hsiao-Hsien, the masterful 68-year-old Taiwanese filmmaker, won best director for his first feature in eight years: "The Assassin," a lushly painterly martial arts drama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The best actress prize was split but not the way some expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It was given to both Rooney Mara, half of the romantic pair of Todd Haynes' '50s lesbian drama "Carol," and Emmanuelle Bercot, the French star of the roller coaster marriage drama "My King."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>(Bercot also directed the festival opener, "Standing Tall," about a delinquent teenager.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Any split was presumed to go to Mara and her "Carol" co-star, Cate Blanchett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Best actor was awarded to Vincent Lindon, the veteran French actor of Stephane Brize's "The Measure of a Man."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He plays a man struggling to make a living after a long period of unemployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The visibly moved Lindon won over some big-name competition, including Michael Caine, the star of Paolo Sorrentino's unrewarded "Youth," a wry, melancholy portrait of old age.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Lindon's award added to a banner year at Cannes for France, which had five films out of the 19 in competition and went home with three awards.</td></tr>
