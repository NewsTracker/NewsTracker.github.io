<h3>LAPD Handwriting Analyst?s Mistake Delayed Case Against Robert Durst</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>While the documentary suggests that a recently discovered letter in which Durst uses the distinctive misspelling "Beverley Hills" helped crack the case (not to mention Durst's muttered confession), a search warrant affidavit released Wednesday reveals that police could have made the link much sooner, but back in 2001 an LAPD document examiner erroneously concluded that the note was written by Nyle Brenner, Berman's manager and friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to the Associated Press, document examiner William Leaver concluded that it was "highly probable" that Brenner wrote the note, eight months before he analyzed Durst's handwriting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Once investigators shifted their focus to Durst, who was under investigation for his first wife's disappearance, they obtained samples of his handwriting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Leaver found "similarities" but said he would need to see more of his writing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In 2002, as Durst was awaiting trial for the murder of Morris Black in Texas, a judge ordered him to reproduce the text of the murderer's note in capital letters, writing "BEVERLEY HILLS POLICE," "1527 BENEDICT CANYON," and "CADAVER."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Leaver changed his conclusion in June 2003, writing that it was "probable" that Durst wrote the murderer's note to police, and "highly probable" that Brenner wasn't the author.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But at that point, Durst had been sentenced to five years in Texas for evidence tampering and bond jumping, so the L.A. case was put on hold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was revived in 2012 when the LAPD learned an HBO documentary was in the works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In September 2014, Leaver's supervisor told a detective that she had "basically 'rubber stamped'" his initial conclusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In addition to the handwriting analysis shown in the film, this fall two independent examiners hired by the LAPD concluded that Durst wrote the note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While some might conclude that shoddy work by the LAPD is the reason that it took a documentary to bring charges in the case, Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said the conflicting handwriting analysis just "shows you what junk science really is."</td></tr>
