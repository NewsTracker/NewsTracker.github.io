<h3>Islamic principal says reports untrue</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The principal of Al-Taqwa College has denied claims girls aren't allowed to participate in running events because it may cause them to lose their virginity or become infertile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Omar Hallak said all students at the Islamic college in Melbourne's west are able to participate in a range of sport such as athletics, including running over distances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Girls are encouraged to participate in all activities, with participation being subject to parental consent," Mr Hallak said in a statement on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We do not believe that running excessively may cause female students to lose their virginity or that sporting injuries could render them infertile."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Hallak came under scrutiny after a leaked letter from a former teacher said girls were being discriminated against.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The principal holds beliefs that if females run excessively, they may 'lose their virginity'," the teacher's letter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>College students also reportedly wrote a letter to Mr Hallak asking to be allowed to run in a cross country event, after they were banned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Education Minister James Merlino says the Victorian Registration and Qualification Authority was investigating, and the comments would be concerning if proved true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There are minimum standards under the VRQA for a school's registration," Mr Merlino told reporters on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There are eight nationally agreed learning areas, including health and PE."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Merlino said there are a range of sanctions available to the VRQA, including ultimately revoking registration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Hallak was in trouble last month when he told students the Islamic State extremist group was a Western plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Merlino said Al-Taqwa had been co-operative since that incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There's been discussions over the last few weeks between government representatives and the school; there will be cross cultural activities undertaken following those comments of a month or so ago," he said.</td></tr>
