<h3>Microsoft is sending HoloLens to space to help NASA</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Microsoft is sending its augmented reality HoloLens glasses into orbit to help out astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The collaboration between the U.S. technology giant and NASA is called "Sidekick" is meant to be a "virtual aid to astronauts working off the Earth, for the Earth", according to the space agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>HoloLens projects holographic images onto the surrounding environment and allows people to interact with the projected images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Astronauts will use Microsoft-owned Skype via HoloLens to allow the ground operator to see what the crew members see and provide real-time guidance to resolve issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The ground operator could also "write" notes and "draw" diagrams on to a crew member's environment to help them through a task.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Previously the astronaut would have relied on written and voice instructions for complex repair tasks or experiments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The second potential use will see HoloLens project animated holographic illustrations on top of object with which the crew is interacting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>NASA said this could reduce the amount of training crews require and "could be an invaluable resource for missions deep into our solar system, where communication delays complicate difficult operations".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This new technology could also empower future explorers requiring greater autonomy on the journey to Mars," Sam Scimemi, director of the ISS program at NASA, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>NASA and Microsoft have been testing project Sidekick in a weightless environment to see whether the device can function in the low gravity environment of the ISS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A pair of the devices will be sent to the space station on June 28 as part of a commercial resupply mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This is not the first collaboration between NASA and Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earlier this year Microsoft said it had worked with NASA to create a hologram image of Mars using the pictures from the Mars Rover, allowing them to explore the surface in close detail from Earth.</td></tr>
