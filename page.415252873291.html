<h3>Netflix and Net Neutrality: Whose Briar Patch Is This Anyway?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Federal Communications Commission hasn't yet officially released its order containing the new net neutrality rules, but there are already a couple of fascinating developments that may give new meaning to the law of unintended consequences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netflix Netflix, which is not only the reigning king of over-the-top video but the most dominant source of Internet video consumption, is a particularly fascinating case study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netflix bestrides the online video world like a colossus, with its streaming usage increasing 350% in the last 10 quarters, and expectations of over 100 million global subscribers by 2020.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But on net neutrality policy and practice, I can't decide whether they look more like John Kerry in the 2004 U.S. Presidential campaign or old Brer Rabbit if he had forgotten which briar patch he wanted to be thrown into.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As you may recall, then-U.S. Senator (now Secretary of State) John Kerry, in the 2004 campaign, while explaining his position on funding for the Iraq War, famously stated that "I actually did vote for [it] before I voted against it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Netflix has gone a silly little step further - it seems to be promoting positions both for and against net neutrality at precisely the same time!</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shall I explain?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In late winter 2014, Netflix famously signed direct, paid "pairing agreements" with both Comcast Comcast and Verizon intended to "improve streaming quality for [Netflix] viewers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And this Netflix approach to working directly with Internet Service Providers didn't end last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Just this past week, it was reported that Netflix has entered into an arrangement with Australia ISP iiiNet to exempt Netflix's video traffic (and its users) from broadband caps imposed by the ISP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>None of this activity is particularly shocking for a company like Netflix given how critical the quality of the video performance is for its customers (who wants to keep watching Internet video if you're fighting buffering the whole time?)</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But it should hardly warm the heart of pro-net neutrality activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In the last week, Netflix seems to be pushing its 2004 Kerry impersonation to the limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A year ago, very shortly after it negotiated its Comcast and Verizon deals, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings unleashed an oft-cited blog post entitled "Internet Tolls And The Case For Strong Net Neutrality."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Netflix has been aggressive in its support for a tough net neutrality approach for a year, rallying supporters online, and declaring at the end of FCC FCC debate that "The FCC settled it: consumers win."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Yet two days ago, Netflix's CFO publicly stated: ""Were we pleased it pushed to Title II?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Probably .[W]e were hoping there might be a non-regulated solution." Huh? My kingdom for a consistent message!</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Now here's where I'm seeing a little twist on Brer Rabbit from Netflix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Remember how Brer Rabbit begged Brer Fox Fox not to be thrown into the briar patch, a ruse because the rabbit "grew up in the briar patch?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Well, Netflix certainly has been clamoring to be thrown into the Title II common carrier regulation briar patch, but unlike Brer Rabbit, why did it get so uncomfortable so quickly?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Does Netflix perhaps see a more favorable set of private agreements it can do with ISPs here in the fashion it just negotiated in Australia?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Nothing in the FCC's statements to date indicates that ISPs can't impose broadband caps charge heavy Internet users more (usage based-pricing).</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>As I noted last week in Forbes, I expect that the new Title II regime will encourage a far more forceful move by ISPs to implement broadband caps and usage-based pricing for consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This is not exactly a new idea - former FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski effectively endorsed such an approach three years ago, and leading media analyst Craig Moffett has been writing for some time now that ISPs ought to be charging for "transport" across all of their service platforms (including multichannel video).</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>This is a rational next step for ISPs given ever-increasing programming costs (and squeezed margins) in the video business, and the new FCC authority to limit wholesale agreements on the broadband side (which might mitigate ISP costs).</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But I don't see this as too appealing to the heaviest retail users or a boost to the overall growth of broadband usage (after all, online usage really took off when AOL went in the opposite direction - to all you can eat pricing).</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Netflix has shown in Australia how it might seek to preserve its position even under such an approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Is Netflix now concerned that this type of arrangement will come under attack here?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>There are many miles to go before any of us sleep on the net neutrality issue, and I've got far more questions than answers about what comes next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I do expect many surprising twists and turns for and by ISPs, application providers, technology vendors, content creators, brands and many others who never before knew they needed to pay such close attention to what happens in Washington, DC on the 8th floor at the Portals (otherwise known as the FCC floor where the Chairman and commissioners work) and in courts that will review everything that takes place there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>And probably a whole lot of confusing briar patches along the way.</td></tr>

<h3>Obama: Racial bias within Ferguson police not isolated</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>America's first black president cast law enforcement reform as a chief struggle for today's civil rights movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Obama said improving civil rights and civil liberties with police is one of the areas that "requires collective action and mobilization" 50 years after pivotal civil rights marches brought change to the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The president made his first remarks about this week's Justice Department report of racial bias in Ferguson, which found officers routinely discriminating against blacks by using excessive force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident," Obama told The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Justice Department on Wednesday cleared Darren Wilson, the white former Ferguson officer who shot Brown, of federal civil rights charges in the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But a separate report released simultaneously found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices in the city that has come to represent the tension between minorities and American police nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Obama's interview was to preview his trip Saturday to Selma, Alabama, where he plans to speak from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where white police officers beat civil rights protesters on March 7, 1965.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Obama last visited Selma in 2007, when he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination and spoke about the responsibility of those who came after the civil rights generation of the '60s to carry on the struggle.</td></tr>
