<tr><td>3</td><td>Arriving at an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers to discuss the Greek crisis, Noonan said Ireland was also able to work with its debt load to make it more manageable, He suggested Greece could also come forward with debt proposals, even if they would be different from Ireland's.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb has summed up just what is on the line financially for his small country in the Greek negotiations - a whopping 10 percent of Finland's annual budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On his way into a meeting with his peers in the 19-country eurozone, Stubb said Greece owes Finland 5 billion euros - a big dent in its budget of 50 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It's also equivalent to 2.5 percent of Finland's annual GDP, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"So a lot is obviously at stake," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Stubb says the meeting is not aimed at kicking Greece out of the euro, but that it's up to Greece's leaders to come up with credible proposals to secure a bailout deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We need to see some political will, a change of attitude on the part of the Greek government in order for this to work," Stubb says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lithuania only started using the euro currency this year and doesn't want the 19-country single currency club to start losing members now.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>Sadzius said he believes common ground can be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Greece's new finance, Euclid Tsakalotos is set to unveil new proposals to his peers in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"In politics, there is always room for compromise," said Sadzius.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says Berlin still opposes an actual debt cut for Greece as he arrived at a meeting with his counterparts in the 19-country eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Schaeuble said he's waiting with interest to hear the ideas of the Greek government but stressed that without an aid program, there is "no possibility to help Greece within the framework of the eurozone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Germany is reluctant to consider a debt cut for Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Greek government wants debt relief for the country to be near the top of bailout discussions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That doesn't necessarily mean an actual reduction in the amount owed - it could take the form of extending the country's repayment schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Schaeuble said actual debt cuts are banned under European rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurozone's top official, says the pressure is on Greece to come up with fresh economic proposals that meet the requirements of its partners in the single currency bloc.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>If new Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos has revised proposals for a fresh bailout of his debt-ridden nation to show his peers in the 19-country eurozone, he was keeping them close to his chest as he arrived for talks in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A day after being sworn in to replace Yanis Varoufakis, who quit after Sunday's referendum 'no' vote, Tsakalotos hurried into the meeting venue without speaking to reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>On Monday, he conceded: "I won't hide from you that I am very nervous and very anxious."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>And in something of an understatement, Tsakalotos said after being sworn in, "I am not taking over at the easiest moment in Greek history."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Dutch State Secretary for Finance Eric Wiebes says Greek representatives need to come up with a serious package at the meeting of eurozone finance ministers if fresh bailout talks are to make any progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"I hope they bring a very serious proposal in their luggage," Wiebes said as he arrived an hour early for the start of the meeting in Brussels.</td></tr>

<tr><td>42</td><td>Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, spelled out what's at stake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"The Greek economy is in danger not just of imploding but of falling into a nightmarish dysfunctionality where what we consider as the normal economic functions of society collapse," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"This is a recipe for anarchy and social disorder."</td></tr>

<tr><td>56</td><td>"I believe something better will happen," he said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>59</td><td>He said one of the purposes later is to "restore order to the situation."</td></tr>

<tr><td>67</td><td>Some investors hope the resignation of Yanis Varoufakis on Monday may well help smooth discussions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Still, few are optimistic and many analysts think that a Greek exit from the euro remains possible.</td></tr>
