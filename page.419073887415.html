<h3>Massachusetts police reach out to drug dealers on Facebook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Authorities in a Massachusetts town are reaching out to drug dealers who want to eliminate their competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Charlton Police Department made a tongue-in-cheek post on their Facebook page Friday offering drug dealers the chance to provide information on their competitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It asks dealers to complete a fill-in-the-blank form that gives them the person's name, address, phone number, what drugs they're selling and where they are being sold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officer Richard McGrath says the post was meant to be entertaining, but says his officers would pursue any leads if a form was filled out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>McGrath told the Telegram & Gazette he found the form online and tailored it for Charlton police use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The department so far has not received a filled-out questionnaire.</td></tr>
