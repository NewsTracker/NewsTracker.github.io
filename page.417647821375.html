<h3>Libya talks endangered as Islamic State group advances</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Friday, March 20, 2015 file photo, U.N. special envoy to Libya, Bernardino Leon, speaks during a press conference at the Palais des Congres of Skhirate, 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of Rabat, Morocco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Libya's parliament drops out of U.N.-brokered negotiations in protest against a draft plan for it to share power with its rivals, throwing doubt on what is seen as a last-chance effort to avert the further collapse of the North African nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) - U.N.-brokered negotiations aimed at stemming Libya's collapse into a failed state threatened to fall apart after the country's internationally recognized parliament on Tuesday dropped out of the talks in protest over a plan that would mean sharing power with its rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The wrangling over the U.N. draft plan came as militants from the North African nation's Islamic State affiliate seized new territory, inching closer to a major city and oil terminals, virtually Libya's sole source of state revenues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The threat of the Islamic State group, which already holds two cities and several towns in Libya, is one of the factors fueling the United Nations' push to resolve the country's chronic chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>European countries fear the extremists will gain a larger bastion just across the Mediterranean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Libya's escalated turmoil the past year has also fueled a sharp increase in migrants using its coast to try to reach European shores, with hundreds dying at sea in the attempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Since early last year, Libya has been split.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the capital Tripoli and most of the west, militias backing Islamist political factions are in control, and the Islamists have set up their own parliament and government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The east is mainly held by the anti-Islamist parliament elected last year, which is recognized internationally and backed by remnants of the Libyan army led by powerful general Khalifa Hifter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The two sides have been fighting for months, with neither able to gain an advantage over the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The draft power-sharing plan was announced Monday from Morocco, where U.N. officials have been mediating talks between the two sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Tuesday, before the Libyan parliament announcement, U.N. envoy Bernardino Leon expressed cautious optimism that the deal would win consensus among rival groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There is a general sense of hope, I would say even optimism ... But still we have to cautious."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After the elected parliament announced its suspension, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, "We all remain hopeful the parties will support the agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Since the ouster and killing of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in the 2011 civil war, Libya has been in chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Successive governments have been powerless since the army and police were shattered by the war and the void was filled by local militias that hold sway, often battling each other and backing rival political factions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The crisis was exacerbated when a militia force known as Libya Dawn, made up mainly of fighters from the third-largest city Misrata, took over Tripoli last year, allowing the Islamist factions including the Muslim Brotherhood to set up their government while the anti-Islamist government fled east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.N. plan leaves much unclear on how the two rivals would be joined in power-sharing, with vague and overlapping powers that risk causing a breakdown even if negotiations do continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The draft calls for the forming of a Tripoli-based National Accord Government, to be worked out between the negotiators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The internationally recognized parliament, known as the House of Representatives, would remain in place as the official legislature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Islamist-dominated Tripoli-based parliament would be dissolved, but 90 of its members would be included in a new 120-member body known as the High Council of State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The draft says that council would be the "highest consultative body" and that its opinion would be binding on drafting laws and government decisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The draft calls for a mechanism to integrate militias into the armed forces, something successive governments have failed to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It calls for the National Accord Government to act as an executive authority with control over vital state institutions and crossings, thought for nearly four years governments have been unable to exert such authority.</td></tr>
