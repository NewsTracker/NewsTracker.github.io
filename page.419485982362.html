<h3>Wild assistant Darryl Sydor charged with drunken driving (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Wild assistant coach Darryl Sydor was jailed on drunken-driving charges Friday after authorities said he became lost trying to take his 12-year-old son to a hockey tournament and ended up apologizing repeatedly to the weeping boy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police pulled Sydor over around 5:15 p.m. Thursday in suburban Fridley after observing him driving erratically, according to the criminal complaint filed in Anoka County District Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His blood-alcohol level later tested at 0.30 percent, more than four times the legal limit, the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It gets the point of being disturbing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When you choose to drink and drive that's one thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But when you choose to drink and drive with your child in the car at such a high level, where you know you're so obnoxiously impaired, that's almost disgusting to me,'' Fridley Police Lt. Michael Monsrud said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sydor remained in the county jail Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Online court records didn't list a lawyer who could comment on his behalf and indicated he did not have an attorney when he made his first court appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bail was set at $12,000, which Monsrud said is standard in such drunken-driving cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was also given the option of enrolling in an alcohol treatment program instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His next court date was set for Oct. 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sydor has been an assistant coach for the Wild for the past four seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He also played 18 seasons in the NHL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''We are aware of the reports regarding Darryl Sydor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>We are continuing to gather information and will have further comment at the appropriate time,'' the team said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>According to the complaint, Sydor told Officer Erik Johnson he was taking his son to a hockey tournament in Plymouth and they were lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The boy was in the front seat and didn't say anything but kept looking at a GPS app on the phone in his lap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Sydor's eyes were bloodshot and watery, and his speech was slow and slurred, the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He had trouble finding his driver's license even though it was in his wallet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The officer smelled a strong odor of alcohol on Sydor's breath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''On several occasions, defendant stopped and told his son, 'I'm sorry,''' the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The boy told Officer Zak Chlebeck they got lost on their way to a 6:30 p.m. game in Plymouth, and that his mother was in Canada visiting family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''He was now crying and upset that his dad had been pulled over,'' the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The officer called the boy's mother, Sharlene Sydor, and told her what was happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Chlebeck then took the boy and his gear to his game and delivered him to his coach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The mother told the officer she would fly home as soon as possible, and the mother and coach made arrangements for caring for the boy after the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Sydor, a defenseman, formerly played for the Los Angeles Kings, Dallas Stars, Columbus Blue Jackets, Tampa Bay Lighting, Pittsburg Penguins and St. Louis Blues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He joined the Wild as an assistant in the 2011-12 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>His total of 1,291 games played ranks 18th all-time by an NHL defenseman, according to the Wild's website.</td></tr>
