<h3>ArtsBeat: ?Broadchurch? Season 2, Episode 3 Recap: The Revenge of Sharon Bishop</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mark Latimer coos this to his newborn daughter, Lizzie, soon after birth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's said with shaky determination and deep regret, and amid the Latimer's grief and marital struggles, a "right" childhood seems impossible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But they and everyone else in the town of Broadchurch soldier on, each on a mission for redemption - the driving force of Season 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What's been remarkable, then, is how conflicting and destructive each of these redemptive missions is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And no one has brought this idea to life more brilliantly than Marianne Jean-Baptiste, playing defense attorney Sharon Bishop, helping the wrong man for the right reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Despite sharing scenes with some of the greatest British actors alive and stepping into a well-established universe, the conflicted, raging Baptiste is emerging as the season's MVP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>What do we know about Baptiste's Bishop?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She's an outsider in many ways: as a Londoner, as an acidic skeptic, as one of the few black characters to arrive in this very pasty town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>(The other black actor to get significant screen time, Chloe's boyfriend, Dean, slunk around the edges as a cocaine connection/secret paintballer and has not returned this season.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She's trained her junior partner to be sharp, charming and ruthless, but still keeps her distance: When Abby Thompson gets a head start on a part of the case, Sharon declines to use her work; she'd rather do it herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She relishes power, being in the spotlight, and antagonizing people, and she's extremely good at all three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In this episode, we finally discover the reason for the massive chip on her shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On the morning of a trial date, Sharon rises heavily at 3:30 in the morning and makes the long trip to visit her incarcerated son, Jonah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When Abby had previously alluded to this looming plot point in Sharon's office, she avoided Sharon's steely gaze and then changed the subject.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the fearsome lawyer is a completely different animal when sitting across the table from Jonah, who has six more years to go and stares at his mother with a weary detachment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"You've got to stay positive about this," she pleads, but it's not clear that she believes it herself, and she moves on to a bland question about the jail food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It's far from an emotional breakdown, but Baptiste reveals Sharon's underbelly with brilliant subtlety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>From these few moments we immediately see why she took on Joe Miller's case: she's trying to right the wrongs of a jumpy and prejudiced court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>When Sharon returns to the courtroom, she's as cunning and harsh as ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She skillfully navigates herself out of a tight spot regarding Joe and Danny's email correspondence, sending Alec Hardy from the room in a fury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And when she gets Ellie Miller on the stand, she eagerly circles her prey, picking apart every detail from her sex life to her sleeping pills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>As she drops the sledgehammer by insinuating an affair between Ellie and Hardy, you see these two formidable women transforming in different directions: Sharon sharpening all her penned up fury into a pointed stick, and Ellie slowly realizing she's being backed into a corner, lips quivering and composure slipping from frame to frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Together, you've put an innocent man in the dock," Sharon rails against the detective pair, and in this twisted moment, she's the tortured mother demanding justice for her beloved child, by shielding a very guilty child killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>While Sharon is becoming more and more of a conflicted hero (or antihero), a clearer villain emerges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Claire Ashworth inches from victim to suspect with every additional moment that her ex-husband Lee is back in her life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She angrily turns on Hardy, who has been protecting her for months, goads Ellie into a terrible double one-night stand, and gives a couple different vague accounts of what happened the night of the Sandbrook murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She has a real femme fatale vibe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>5) Hardy to Ellie: "What is the point of you, Miller!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>4) Mark Latimer to Reverend Paul Coates: "God's not in this house - surely that's clear by now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>3) Ellie to Hardy: "I hope you bloody well crash and have a heart attack while you're crashing!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>2) Hardy, on Bishop: "Those barristers. Who are they? They've never done anything in their life, they just stand there sniping!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>1) Ellie to Hardy: "Why are you being such a f***wit about this?"</td></tr>

<h3>Robert Morris gets balanced scoring to top N. Florida 81-77 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Even down by six points at half and by 13 early in the second half, Robert Morris never forgot that the NCAA Tournament was supposed to be fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lucky Jones scored 21 points, including a key free throw, Rodney Pryor had 20 and Marcquise Reed 19 to lead the Colonials to an 81-77 victory over North Florida on Wednesday night in the First Four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''We made sure coming into halftime that we remembered this is a blessing to be out here, to enjoy the moment,'' Pryor said with a wide grin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Part of the reason they had so much fun was a second half without a turnover, plus completely stifling the high-scoring, perimeter-minded Ospreys down the stretch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''At halftime we let (the players) be for about 5 or 6 minutes, and I think they figured it out,'' said coach Andy Toole, avoiding a fire-and-brimstone speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Colonials (20-14), who won the Northeast Conference Tournament to get into the field as a 16 seed, now meet top-seeded Duke in the second round on Friday in Charlotte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They failed to score for 4:31 of the first half, putting themselves in a hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Down by 13 early in the second half after a pair of Beau Beech 3s, they turned the tables by shutting out North Florida for 4:44 to get back in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''We were in a drought, which is unlike us,'' said coach Matthew Driscoll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''Giving up 52 points in a half is unlike us, not close to what we've been doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>With the teams tied, Reed - a freshman - drove the lane and spun in a left-handed layup and was fouled with 3:49 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He missed the free throw, but Jones was there to tip in the miss for a 70-66 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Pryor then added a 15-foot jumper and Kavon Stewart hit a free throw to push the lead to seven with 2 minutes left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Ospreys got within 78-76 with 10 seconds left, but Stewart made two more foul shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>With the lead at three and less than a second left, Jones - the Colonials' third-leading scorer who comes off the bench - made a free throw to clinch it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Beech finished with 28 points for the Ospreys (23-12), champs of the Atlantic Sun Tournament who were making their first trip to the NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>BEAU'S A BEECH: Beech more than doubled his 12.5 points a game average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But when it mattered the most - in the second half when the Colonials' defense tightened - he didn't have a field goal over the last 11:18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''They kind of switched to a matchup zone, kind of a man-to-man,'' said Beech, who was 6 of 10 on 3s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''It limited my 3-point attempts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But we had clean looks the whole second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Ah, the turnovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>North Florida had 19 to only five by the Colonials, who held a 21-5 advantage on points off mistakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>BEDEVILED: As the final seconds ticked off, jubilant BobbyMo fans chanted, ''We want Duke!</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Now they've got them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>What'll they do with them though?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''I like our chances,'' said Jones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''It's a team game, no matter who they have on their team, no matter how many TV games they have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>I love Robert Morris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>MISFIRING: North Florida, averaging 76 points a game while shooting 47 percent, couldn't get a basket in the waning moments against Robert Morris' stingy D.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Ospreys' last field goal came with 5:30 left; they hit 13 of 14 free throws the rest of the way, the only miss an intentional one by Beech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Robert Morris: The Colonials were making their eighth trip to the NCAA, but first since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Their last trip was brief, but memorable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The 15th-seeded Colonials nearly knocked off No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>2-seeded Villanova in the opening round in Providence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>They led 55-47 with 4:19 left, but mistakes down the stretch resulted in a 73-70 overtime loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>North Florida: For financial reasons (hefty guarantees to play at bigger schools) the Ospreys played 13 of their first 16 games on the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>They traveled to nine states and Mexico this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Robert Morris: Top-seeded Duke (29-4) on Friday at 7:10 p.m. in Charlotte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>North Florida: The three top scorers are back, with the major loss Nesbitt, a 6-6 senior.</td></tr>
