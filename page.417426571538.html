<h3>UEFA plotting breakaway 'World Cup' in bid to force reform and get rid of Sepp Blatter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A European Championship every two years with invites to other big football countries outside Europe is one of the proposals UEFA are putting forward in the fight against FIFA corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The initiative would see all the top-ranked teams in world football take part in a competition that would not be under the jurisdiction of Sepp Blatter's administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter and FIFA have been tarnished almost beyond repair after the arrest of seven of the body's officials and the indictment of 18 people on 100million worth of fraud, bribery and kick-back charges in a United States-led investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The radical plan was proposed by Denmark's UEFA ExCo member Allan Hansen - one of the powerbrokers keen on UEFA breaking away from FIFA - at a meeting of Europe's 54 territories and ahead of 79-year-old Blatter's re-election for a fifth term as president last Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And the fact that Blatter defeated his rival for the presidency, Prince Ali of Jordan, despite the latter having more than half of South America's CONMEBOL confederation voting for him, gives extra credence to Hansen's plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Since the World Cup was first played for in 1930, the winner has always come from Europe or Latin America, whose football hotbeds of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Colombia might all take up a UEFA invite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hansen believes his plan would be attractive enough to take significant sponsorship and broadcasting rights - FIFA's two important revenue streams - away from Zurich until FIFA reforms itself to the extent that UEFA feel they can take part in a global World Cup once again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This will not happen until Blatter is deposed but the belief is growing that it will occur a long time before the finish of his latest four-year tenure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The FA are one of the national associations committed to making that change happen from FA president Prince William - who gave unprecedented royal support to the FA's stance in his speech before the FA Cup final between Arsenal and Aston Villa on Saturday - to rank and file councillors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>FA chairman Greg Dyke believes it is only a matter of time before the FBI or Swiss police, who have launched a criminal investigation into the campaigns to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, catch up with Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dyke spoke out after US Attorney General Loretta Lynch called the arrest of FIFA officials last Wednesday and the indictment of 18 people connected with football 'only the beginning'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He has called on UEFA president Michel Platini, who made a personal plea for Blatter to quit on the eve of the election, to lead a co-ordinated opposition to the FIFA president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>UEFA are holding a special ExCo meeting and a discussion involving all their 54 countries in Berlin later this week to plot their next move ahead of the Champions League final between Barcelona and Juventus on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dyke said: 'It does require real leadership and Mr Platini has got to stand up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He stood up and criticised Sepp Blatter, he has now got to lead the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There would certainly be us, the Dutch and the Germans demanding change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'There's absolutely no point England saying we are not going to take part in the World Cup because our fans and players would not thank us for it and it would have no impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It would just be gesture politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But if we could get 10 large countries to do the same thing, then I think we could have a big impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'The FBI and the Swiss authorities are much more important than the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Lord Macdonald, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, expects Blatter to be questioned as part of the probe by the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies - possibly under arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'The real threat to Mr Blatter does not come from the Swiss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It comes from the US, their anti-racketeering legislation and co-operating accomplices,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'We may be sure that somewhere in the hallowed halls of the Justice Department in Washington, there is an organisation chart fixed to a wall with a photo of FIFA's president pinned at the top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'This case threatens Mr Blatter because the scale of the corruption is so vast - and the contracts so huge - that prosecutors will not believe that wrongdoing is limited to a few rotten apples operating out of sight of an innocent president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Brazen Blatter insists he has no fear of arrest because he has done nothing wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He blames FIFA's chronic troubles on a Western conspiracy led by British media and the Americans, who are upset at losing the 2022 vote to Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But the Swiss media, turning on Blatter for the first time last week, is hugely relevant along with the Swiss authorities mounting their own investigation into those two murky World Cup host awards to Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Meanwhile, UEFA's strength around the FIFA ExCo table, despite David Gill not taking up his place because he refuses to serve on any committee chaired by Blatter, was shown at the first meeting of the president's fifth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Blatter had threatened to change the World Cup continent allocations to the detriment of UEFA, who were adamant they would not give up any of their 13 places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>They did not lose any and, in fact, will have 14 representatives in Russia because the host country remains a separate entity, rather than having to come from a confederation's allocation.</td></tr>
