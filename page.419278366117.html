<h3>Harvard student loses Facebook gig for app that shows flaws</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BOSTON (AP) - A Harvard University student says he lost his internship at Facebook after he launched a browser application from his dorm room that exploited privacy flaws on the company's mobile messenger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Aran Khanna's app - called Marauder's Map in tribute to the Harry Potter books - showed that users of Facebook Messenger could pinpoint the exact locations of people they were talking to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He told Boston.com (http://bit.ly/1NcW7km ) he created the app to show the consequences of unintentionally sharing data and thought he was doing a public service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I didn't write the program to be malicious," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Khanna launched the app from his dorm room in May and said 85,000 people downloaded it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Days later, Facebook asked Khanna to disable it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A week after that, Facebook released a Messenger app update addressing the flaw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Facebook spokesman Matt Steinfeld said the company had been working on a Messenger update months before it became aware of Khanna's app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This isn't the sort of thing that can happen in a week," Steinfeld said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Two hours before he was supposed to leave to start his internship, Khanna received a call from a Facebook employee telling him that the company was rescinding the offer because he had violated the Facebook user agreement when he scraped the site for data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Khanna wrote about the experience in a case study published Tuesday for the Harvard Journal of Technology Science.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He spent the summer interning at a Silicon Valley startup and said the back-and-forth with Facebook ended up being a learning experience as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg launched the social media site from a Harvard dorm room in 2004.</td></tr>
