<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tairod Pugh, 47, who had spent the last 18 months living in the Middle East and has an Egyptian wife, allegedly tried to travel to Syria in January weeks after being sacked as a plane mechanic.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>Pugh was indicted with attempting to support a foreign terrorist organization for nine months from May 2014 to January, and with obstruction of justice over the tampering of electronic evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted and will appear before federal Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Court papers show he cropped up on the FBI's radar as early as 2001 as an American Airlines employee purportedly sympathetic to the Al-Qaeda mastermind responsible for the 9/11 attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prosecution documents say 180 jihadist videos were found on his laptop, including one showing IS killers shooting a group of prisoners in the head one by one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It also allegedly contained information on crossing points into Syria and a letter to his wife calling himself a "mujahid" -- or holy warrior -- who faced either victory or martyrdom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>US intelligence officials say more than 20,000 volunteers from around the world, including more than 150 Americans, have gone to Syria to link up with extremists.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>In 1998, he moved to Texas, converted to Islam and "became increasingly radical in his beliefs," according to the complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>By 2001 -- the year that Al-Qaeda hijacked US passenger jets -- he was working as a mechanic for American Airlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That year, the FBI received a tip from a co-worker alleging he was sympathetic to bin Laden and that he claimed the 1998 Al-Qaeda bombings of US embassies in East Africa, which killed 224 people, were justified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 2002, "an associate" subsequently told the FBI that Pugh had wanted to travel to Chechnya to fight jihad.</td></tr>
