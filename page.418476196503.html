<h3>Djokovic beats Federer for 3rd Wimbledon title, 9th major (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON (AP) -- For the second year in a row, Novak Djokovic solved Roger Federer's superb serve in the Wimbledon final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And for the second year in a row, Djokovic claimed the championship at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament, preventing Federer from earning a record eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The match was as even as possible through two sets, before the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>1-seeded Djokovic grabbed ahold of it and wouldn't let go, generating four service breaks that carried him past Federer 7-6 (1), 6-7 (10), 6-4, 6-3 on Sunday for his third title at Wimbledon and ninth Grand Slam trophy overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That puts him more than halfway to the record 17 collected by Federer, who has reached two major finals over the past three seasons - both at Wimbledon, both against Djokovic, both losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They have met 40 times, each winning 20 matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As always, it presented a fascinating duel: Federer's serve and attacking style vs. Djokovic's return and scrambling, body-twisting defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''He makes you push your limits, he makes you work hard and earn every single point,'' said Djokovic, who equaled his coach Boris Becker's three Wimbledon titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Federer was grim-faced as he walked across the Centre Court lawn to receive his runner-up tray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''You sort of walk away empty-handed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For me, a finalist trophy is not the same,'' Federer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At Wimbledon in 2014, Federer held serve in 88 of 89 games through the semifinals, then got broken four times by Djokovic during the five-set final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This fortnight, Federer held serve in 89 of 90 games entering the final, then again met his match in Djokovic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Djokovic's serve was stout, as well: He saved 6 of 7 break points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It helped, too, that Federer was not the same height-of-his-powers player who defeated Andy Murray in the semifinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pressured by Djokovic's ability to extend points, Federer committed 35 unforced errors; Djokovic made only 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Federer is right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He might very well be the greatest of all time, as some say, but right now, the best in the men's game is Djokovic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The 28-year-old Serb won the Australian Open in January, then was the runner-up at the French Open last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Go further back, and Djokovic reached 15 of the past 20 Grand Slam finals, winning eight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Still, it was clear which player most spectators were pulling for: Federer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>So breathlessly quiet between points that ball bounces at the baseline could be heard before serves, fans voiced an ''awwwww'' of lament after a fault by Federer or a mid-point ''ooooh'' of excitement when he would hit an exquisite shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>So Federer, and his supporters, rued letting the opening set get away, when he twice held set point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The opening tiebreaker was all Djokovic, ending flatly when Federer double-faulted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That was part of a run in which Djokovic reeled off 14 of 15 points, particularly noteworthy against this foe, on this surface, at this tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Federer owns seven Wimbledon titles, including five straight from 2003-07.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That was the last time a man lifted the trophy in consecutive years at the All England Club until Djokovic crouched down Sunday to pluck a few blades of grass and shove them in his mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''It tasted very, very good this year,'' Djokovic joked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He had a chance to run away with it in the second set, seven times standing a point from a two-set lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But seven times, Federer wouldn't let him convert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>So 110 minutes in, they were all tied up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Not just at a set apiece, mind you, but here's how close it was: In the first set, each man won 37 points; in the second set, each man won 51 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''A pity I couldn't make more of the momentum, I guess,'' Federer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Indeed, 15 minutes later, Djokovic regained the upper hand, breaking to lead 2-1 in the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>After a 20-minute rain delay at 3-2, Djokovic finished off the set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Federer failed to put up much resistance in the fourth, getting broken twice more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>When Djokovic redirected a 123 mph serve by smacking a down-the-line backhand return winner, he reached championship point and bellowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>A forehand winner followed, and it was over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''It feels good when you make a return winner off Roger's serve on the grass,'' Djokovic said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Not for most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But Djokovic is alone at the top for the moment.</td></tr>
