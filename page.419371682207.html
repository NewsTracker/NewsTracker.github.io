<h3>Bali nine mule Renae Lawrence recommended for sentence reduction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Renae Lawrence in Bangli prison, central Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kerobokan: Bali nine drug mule Renae Lawrence's father hopes she will be home within four years after Indonesian prison authorities recommended another nine months be shaved off her sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However Bob Lawrence revealed his daughter did not wish to be released on parole in Bali, preferring to serve out her sentence at Bangli prison in central Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"She doesn't want parole. She doesn't want to do what [Schapelle] Corby's done, she wants to serve out her time," Mr Lawrence said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bali Nine mule Si Yi Chen at Kerobokan jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Corby, who was released on parole in February last year after nine years behind bars, will have to live in Bali under strict parole conditions until 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Made Malena, a prison officer at Bangli prison, said Lawrence had been recommended for a six-month remission on Indonesian Independence Day on August 17, but it was yet to be approved by Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However she has already been granted a three-month remission as part of bonuses granted to prisoners to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Indonesia's declaration of independence in 1945.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rahol, the Iranian prisoner who Myuran Sukumaran asked to take over the painting room in Kerobokan jail after he was executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The nine months would come on top of remissions granted in previous years to her original 20-year sentence for her role in an attempt to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin into Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We miss her badly," Mr Lawrence said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"She's a real goer, she loves to be in the garden or panel beating cars. She's not one for sitting around. Hopefully in another four years she's home."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In June, Lawrence told Fairfax Media her release was something she preferred not to think about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If we think about going home all the time, it doesn't help us, it just makes you more stressed. So it's better to just wake up in the morning, do what you've got to do and then go to bed and wake up the next morning. And one day it will come they will just call me and say: 'OK, you're going home'."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The six other living Bali nine members are not eligible for remissions because they are serving life sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This time last year former Kerobokan prison governor Farid Junaedi recommended that Bali nine co-ordinators Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan have their sentences reduced to life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>However the pair were executed in late April after President Joko Widodo called for "shock therapy" to reduce the scourge of drugs in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At a ceremony in Kerobokan jail to mark Independence Day, Bali nine mule Si Yi Chen said he was still processing the deaths of Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Chen works five days a week in a silversmith studio inside the jail, where he creates a line of jewellery that reflects his devotion to Taoism, as part of an art rehabilitation program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Mule Jewels collection, which is sold online and at shops in Ubud and Gili Trawangan, include a range called "A tribute to Myu and Andrew", with Mercy charms, earrings and pendants and a braided cross pendant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"You just have to think positive because negativity doesn't solve anything," Chen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Sukumaran asked Rahol, an Iranian prisoner serving a life sentence for drug trafficking in Kerobokan jail, to take charge of the painting room in Kerobokan jail after he was executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rahol said painting classes were continuing every Wednesday but life was not the same without Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Every morning when I open the door I cannot see Myuran. I say good morning to his place. He doesn't answer but he is here. We feel him all the time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Rahol said he always wondered why Sukumaran pushed him so hard with his painting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Now I understand. Everything I learned from him, English, painting, how to be strong in here. I am 31 and I will never see another person like Myuran."</td></tr>
