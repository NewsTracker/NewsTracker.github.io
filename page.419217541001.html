<h3>Police shooting and protests put Ferguson back on edge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Riot police contain roughly 200 protesters after violent anniversary of police shooting of black teenager Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Protesters regrouped in Ferguson, Missouri, after a state of emergency was declared, aimed at preventing a repeat of violence the night before on the anniversary of the police shooting of an unarmed black man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police in riot gear contained roughly 200 protesters who had gathered in the streets of Ferguson on Monday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The demonstrators, some waving flags, beating drums, and shouting anti-police slogans, marched along a street that was a flashpoint of last year's riots which erupted after white police officer Darren Wilson shot dead 18-year-old black teen Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nine people were arrested late on Monday after a group of protesters briefly blocked the roadway, though demonstrations late into the evening were largely peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities had declared a state of emergency on Monday for the St Louis suburb and surrounding areas after police officers shot and critically wounded a man in an exchange of gunfire Sunday night, marring what had been a day of peaceful demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police just charged at protesters and snatched several men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>@stlcountypd officer alleges "they had weapons".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Among the demonstrators on Monday evening was 51-year-old Ferguson resident Roberta Lynch, who said relations between the police and community had improved little over the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They are doing the same old stuff, taking our rights," Lynch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"They need to give us our space."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Monday's demonstrations capped a day of civil disobedience called by activists to protest the shooting of Brown and other unarmed black men across the United States by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Clergy and civil rights groups led a series of protests, at one point staging a demonstration at a courthouse in St Louis where 60 people were arrested, including Princeton University professor and activist Cornel West, according to a protest organiser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hours later, police arrested dozens of protesters who blocked rush-hour traffic on Interstate 70 a few kilometres from Ferguson, according to a Reuters news agency witness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The death of Brown and a grand jury's decision to spare the white officer from criminal charges led to a wave of demonstrations that boiled over into rioting and arson at times and spawned sympathy rallies across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Brown's death also prompted greater scrutiny of racial bias within the US criminal justice system, giving rise to the "Black Lives Matter" movement that gained momentum from other high-profile killings of unarmed minorities by white police in cities such as New York, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, and most recently, Arlington, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tensions grew as darkness fell on Monday, with several confrontations between police wearing riot gear and demonstrators.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>"We are going to let them vent and we are going to manage it the best we possibly can," Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Last night was pretty out of control at times. Unfortunately, all the good work that's happening on both sides of the street has been marred by violence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The violence, according to Belmar, erupted Sunday when two groups of agitators apparently began shooting at each other, disputing what had been peaceful demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At one point a gunman darted across a parking lot and was confronted by four officers who pulled up in an unmarked vehicle.</td></tr>
