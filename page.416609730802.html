<h3>Greek football chief confident of avoiding FIFA, UEFA bans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece are hopeful of avoiding FIFA and UEFA bans from international and European football competitions over a proposed new sports law, the country's Football Federation (EPO) chief George Gkirtzikis said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece were warned that they could face a suspension over government interference if the sports law was voted in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But after emerging from talks between Stavros Kontonis, Deputy Minister for Education, Culture and Religious Affairs, and UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino, Gkirtzikis indicated a compromise over the law had been reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"During the meeting our understanding is that the state will make some changes, which both federations are awaiting," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The law has been deferred to be discussed next Wednesday and Thursday (instead of Monday and Tuesday). We serve football and no one wants to be excluded from international competitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Mr Infantino came to give some useful advice in order to avoid a (ban) and examine the text which will be submitted to a vote in Parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I hope what has been discussed will be signed off and I expect it to be. Every summer we make changes in the statutes of FIFA and UEFA in order for everyone to be aligned."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Following continuous problems with crowd trouble, the government has put together a new set of regulations in an attempt to crack down on violence at sports events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But FIFA and UEFA have strict rules to protect their member federations' independence in running their own affairs and sent a joint letter to Gkirtzikis last week warning they "would have no option but to refer the case to the relevant bodies for immediate sanctions, including the suspension of EPO."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The bill, entitled "Measures for the confrontation of violence in Greek sports and other provisions", will be voted on in parliament on May 6-7 with the expected necessary adjustments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After emerging from Wednesday's meeting Kontonis said: "The conversation was frank, constructive and productive while clarification was given to Mr Infantino on two issues of concern to federations: self-rule and the procedure of appointing judges to disciplinary bodies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I am absolutely satisfied with the discussion. I thank the representatives of the parties and I think that both federations can now safely reach conclusions because today they heard the authenticity of the state's positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The government does not want to exclude teams from Europe because it takes the country and its workers - the players and everyone else involved -- into account..."</td></tr>
