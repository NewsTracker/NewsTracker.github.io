<h3>CIA allegedly sought to hack Apple iPhones from earliest days</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The report cites top-secret U.S. documents that suggest U.S. government researchers had created a version of XCode, Apple's software application development tool, to create surveillance back doors into programs distributed on Apple's App Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Intercept has in the past published a number of reports from documents released by Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The site's editors include Glenn Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his work in reporting on Snowden's revelations, and by Oscar-winning documentary maker Laura Poitras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It said the latest documents, which covered a period from 2006 to 2013, stop short of proving whether U.S. intelligence researchers had succeeded in breaking Apple's encryption coding, which secures user data and communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Efforts to break into Apple products by government security researchers started as early as 2006, a year before Apple introduced its first iPhone and continued through the launch of the iPad in 2010 and beyond, The Intercept said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Breeching Apple security was part of a top-secret program by the U.S. government, aided by British intelligence researchers, to hack "secure communications products, both foreign and domestic" including Google Android phones, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that their products have not become tools for widespread government surveillance of citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Last September, Apple strengthened encryption methods for data stored on iPhones, saying the changes meant the company no longer had any way to extract customer data on the devices, even if a government ordered it to with a search warrant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Silicon Valley rival Google Inc said shortly afterward that it also planned to increase the use of stronger encryption tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both companies said the moves were aimed at protecting the privacy of users of their products and that this was partly a response to wide-scale U.S. government spying on Internet users revealed by Snowden in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Apple spokesman pointed to public statements by Chief Executive Tim Cook on privacy but declined to comment further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a back door in any of our products or services," Cook wrote in a statement on privacy and security published last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron have expressed concern that turning such privacy-enhancing tools into mass market features could prevent governments from tracking militants planning attacks.</td></tr>

<h3>US ambassador to South Korea released from hospital after knife attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The US ambassador to South Korea was released from hospital on Tuesday where he was treated for a knife attack, saying the incident was "scary" but he would not change his "open and friendly" approach to the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mark Lippert, 42, underwent surgery to treat deep gashes to his cheek and hand after he was slashed by a knife-wielding nationalist at a breakfast function in central Seoul last Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hospital officials said after five days of treatment the US diplomat had now had all 80 stitches from his face removed and the pain in his left wrist had subsided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I feel pretty darn good, all thing considered", a smiling Mr Lippert said before he was discharged, speaking to journalists with part of his face covered with clear adhesive bandages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It was obviously a scary incident but I am walking, talking, holding my baby, hugging my wife. So I just feel really good", the new father said, adding he would get back to work "as soon as possible".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Lippert, whose popularity among South Koreans has only grown since the attack, expressed gratitude at the "outpouring of support" he and his family have received.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We have made it our mission to be open and friendly. And that will not change," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The bottom line is that this incident has only strengthened our love and affection for this country and our belief in the unbreakable bond that exists between the United States and the Republic of Korea."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The assailant Kim Ki-Jong was formally charged with attempted murder on Friday, despite his pleas that he never intended to kill the ambassador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Asked if he had carried out the assault on the orders of North Korea, Kim insisted he acted alone, while North Korea accused the South of launching a "vicious" smear campaign to tie its leadership to the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kim, 55, has a previous conviction for hurling a rock at the then-Japanese ambassador in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kim said he attacked Mr Lippert as a protest against ongoing South-US army drills, which he blamed for souring inter-Korean relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The annual drills, known as Foal Eagle and Key Resolve, have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Lippert said in the aftermath of the attack US security authorities would "take a hard look" at security tactics and technical procedures in South Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Since his arrival in South Korea last year, Mr Lippert has proved a popular ambassador, tweeting regularly about his life in Seoul and setting up a tongue-in-cheek Twitter account for his dog, Grigsby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Since he was hospitalised, his Twitter account has drawn many messages of support, and groups of well-wishers have rallied in front of the US embassy and outside the hospital to denounce the attack.</td></tr>
