<h3>Microsoft's hardware strategy under scrutiny after record loss</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sales of Microsoft Corp's Surface tablets and Xbox gaming consoles are soaring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But they contribute less than a 10th of the company's revenue and, analysts say, they're probably barely profitable - if they are profitable at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>So are the businesses worth it?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Not unless they start to generate significant profits soon, some analysts say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Unless Microsoft can get to hardware break-even within two years or demonstrate sufficient offsetting value elsewhere in the portfolio, we think the company should exit the hardware business," RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a client note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Exiting hardware could add up to $4 per share to Microsoft's market value, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Microsoft, which is shuttering its Nokia phone business, said on Tuesday it would pump the ensuing savings into its fast-growing cloud business, Windows 10 and its hardware division, which includes tablets, Xbox and smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Analysts agree that investing in cloud and Windows 10 makes strategic sense, but some say the rationale behind pouring more money into hardware is less clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Hardware remains a more commoditized piece across tech," said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives, who thinks all of Microsoft's resources should be going into software.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Hardware is not what got Microsoft here - software did."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Microsoft's shares fell as much as 4 percent on Wednesday, a day after the company reported a record quarterly loss due to the $7.5 billion writedown of its Nokia phone business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even so, Chief Executive Satya Nadella said he remained committed to making phones to attract Windows users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Microsoft doesn't break out operating margins for its hardware business, but Jefferies & Co analyst John DiFucci told Reuters he believed the Xbox business was at best break-even and that Surface was unprofitable on an operating basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We believe redeploying funds into ... hardware is a mistake given that business's lack of margin and strategic importance to Microsoft," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Including the impact of a strong dollar, revenue from Microsoft's computing and gaming hardware business rose 44 percent in the fourth quarter ended June 30 - half the increase achieved in the company's cloud business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Still, Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler said he didn't expect Microsoft to drop either Surface or Xbox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Investors will be fine with both if they are break-even or going to be there shortly," he said in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Moerdler said Microsoft likely would increasingly make gaming available on Windows as a way to attract users to Windows devices.</td></tr>
