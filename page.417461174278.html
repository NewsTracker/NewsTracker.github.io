<h3>Myanmar party over as Ukraine hit them for six</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WELLINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - Myanmar's under-20 World Cup 'party' came to a crashing halt on Tuesday when they were hammered 6-0 by Ukraine, with all six goals coming in the second half, prompting the Asian side's German coach to apologise to their fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Myanmar, who qualified for the tournament for the first time by reaching the Asian under-19 championships semi-finals on home soil last year, had given the United States a massive fright in their opening game on Saturday before eventually losing 2-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They managed to hold Ukraine scoreless in the first half in Whangarei before the Europeans scored six in the second, with Shakhtar Donetsk's Viktor Kovalenko grabbing a brace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The scoreline could have been even worse had Pavlo Polehenko not missed a penalty after defender Thiha Htet Aung was sent off for a hand ball on the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We must be realists, the party is over," Myanmar coach Gerd Zeise told a media conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I must apologise to the Myanmar fans, I am responsible for this disaster, but I can't turn a cyclist into a racing driver."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Like many developing nations in Asia, world governing body FIFA has pumped money into the country and given more than $1.1 million through its Goal programme over the past five years to fund facilities and training programmes for age-group players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Myanmar's qualification for the tournament in New Zealand was seen as proof the money was working.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Zeise, however, suggested the tournament, despite causing an outpouring of celebrations back home, had come too early for his side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Obviously we only had the power for one match. The European teams play in another league and we cannot follow," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It was a disaster and this tournament has come too early for us. We cannot follow these teams, no chance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Myanmar's final game is on Friday in Wellington against hosts New Zealand, who were beaten 4-0 by the United States in Auckland, and must beat Zeise's side to give themselves a hope of qualifying for the knockout phase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Austria took a huge step towards the round of 16 with a 2-1 victory over Panama, who finished with nine men, in a spiteful encounter in Wellington, where the Europeans also had two penalties saved by Jaime De Gracia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ghana also shook off the rust that had characterised their fortuitous 1-1 draw against Austria on Saturday, which was sealed with a stoppage-time penalty, with an impressive 3-2 victory over Humberto Grondona's Argentina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Grondona's side, one of the pre-tournament favourites, scored two late goals to set up a tense final few minutes but have just one point from two games and face the Austrians on Friday.</td></tr>
