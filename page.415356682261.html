<h3>Clinton: would have been better to have second email address</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a press conference at the United Nations in New York March 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday she should have used a government email account as U.S. secretary of state, though she said she violated no rules, in her first public remarks over a controversy that could cloud her expected bid for the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton, the presumed front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, has come under fire for using a private email account for official business when she was the top U.S. diplomat because of concerns that she hid important facts about her tenure and put her correspondence at a security risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two," Clinton said at a press conference at the United Nations in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Looking back, it would've been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton said she had provided to the State Department all of her emails that could possibly be work-related for archiving purposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She said she chose not to keep personal emails on topics such as yoga routines, her deceased mother's funeral arrangements or her daughter's wedding plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton's decision to address reporters reflects a calculation among her advisers that the issue was ballooning into crisis-like proportions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The story has dominated cable news for days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The former U.S. senator and first lady insisted she had done nothing wrong and had complied with all government regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Most of her official emails were sent to government addresses, which were automatically preserved, Clinton said, and no classified material was sent via email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She said her family's server would remain private and rejected calls that it be studied by an independent arbiter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The State Department said on Tuesday it would post Clinton's emails on a website after a review that was likely to take several months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Clinton tried to head off criticism last week by urging the department to quickly review and release her emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I want it all out there," Clinton said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Regrettably we are left with more questions than answers," said Representative Trey Gowdy, a Republican who chairs a congressional committee looking into the Benghazi, Libya, attacks of 2012 that led to the deaths of four Americans while Clinton was secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The Select Committee is left with no choice but to call her to appear at least twice," Gowdy added in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for Republican President George W. Bush, scoffed at Clinton's explanation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Personal convenience? Hah. She did it because she only trusts a few top aides and wanted total control," he wrote in a tweet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Democrats, who are wary that their party's front-runner for the 2016 White House race could be tarnished, were pleased that she addressed the issue but critical of the time it took to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"By waiting so long to finally show her face and address it, I think it just allowed this thing to spiral out of control," said a former Clinton adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"There is an arrogance that comes with this operation to some extent that says that they don't have to play by the same rules. You know what? You do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The issue has complicated what has been seen as a clear pathway for the Democratic nomination, who lost the 2008 primary race to Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But the issue may not resonate with voters or with the donors who will be critical to funding Clinton's campaign.</td></tr>

<h3>Like 'a horror movie': The visceral testimony of the Boston bomber trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Warning: This story contains graphic content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two years after the Boston Marathon bombing, the horror of that day is fresh in the minds of the witnesses testifying at the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For many, much of the coverage immediately after the bombing - which killed three people and injured 260 - focused on the manhunt for Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But this trial is heavily focused on the aftermath of the blast and the human cost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During a break in the first week of testimony, I took a quick look at my laptop so I could highlight phrases uttered in court that I'd tapped out on the fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Designed to tear people apart."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Kill as as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Shredding their flesh."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As we sat there, with reporters in the main courtroom and in two overflow rooms with closed-circuit TVs, it all seemed full-on surreal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Even though we all knew well what had happened, we'd now have it spelled out in bloody detail by those who lived through the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Witnesses teared up as it all poured out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>No one held back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some likened the scene on Boylston Street on April 15, 2013, to a war zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Or, as one woman put it, "I felt like I was starring in a horror movie" and those walking nearby were "like zombies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said someone shouted at her to get up and get out, but "I didn't have a leg," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I couldn't get up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Lawyers put images on screen that had never been seen publicly before: Smartphone video with close-ups on pools of the brightest red blood you can imagine amid smoke and sirens and shouts from off camera such as "Whose leg is that?" and "There's no way she's going to keep that foot."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This still image captured from surveillance video at the Boston Marathon shows the scene moments before a second bomb exploded on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sidewalk security video captured the moment the second blast went off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The camera was directly behind where the bomb had been set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When it played out, there were gasps in the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Typically, each witness would be asked to identify themselves or family members from photos taken just before and just after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>William Richard, whose eight-year-old son Martin died in the blasts, did that several times with photos of his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In the "before" shots, William pointed to himself, his wife, Denise, his sons Henry and Martin and then to his daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"And that's Jane with two legs," he'd say each time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In the "after" photos, it'd be simply, "And that's Jane."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Richard later testified he had to leave Martin on the sidewalk with his wife so he could rush Jane (who now has only one leg) to the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Richard said the air smelled "vile" and he knew Martin was dying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The bomb, said prosecutors, "tore large chunks of flesh out of [the little boy's] body."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Did you say anything to Martin before you left?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Richard was asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A police officer testified how she cradled Lingzi Lu, the Chinese student fatally wounded that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>She said Lingzi had vomited and there was debris in her hair and "blood, flesh, bone" everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Her body quivering," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Her eyes appeared shaky, as if she couldn't understand what was going on with her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The officer later sought out Lingzi's family to tell them their daughter hadn't died alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Once in court, someone used the term "zipper-like wounds."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Others were equally graphic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"Legs were ripped off," said one witness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"It wasn't anything clean or neat."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>One young woman, now 21, had her foot blown off and her femoral artery severed, which in most cases means you could lose all of your blood within roughly a minute or two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>She said she thought, "This can't be real" and heard a man saying "he could see I was going white and my eyes were going white and I could feel my body getting tingly and I was getting increasingly cold and I knew I was dying."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Thankfully, she didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Jeff Bauman lost both his legs above the knee that day, has a hole in his arm with burns and scarring on his back and, like so many others, still has constant ringing in his ears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>He walked into the courtroom on what was a bitterly cold Boston morning - while wearing shorts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>His two prosthetic legs looked like black sticks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Bauman explained that his mechanical knees aren't motorized and "if I wear pants it kinda gets in the way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>It was hard to tell, but it seemed as if Bauman kept glancing at Tsarnaev, sitting with his lawyers a couple of metres away, wearing a sport jacket, button-down shirt and goatee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defence team has acknowledged that their client planted a bomb to kill people at the Boston Marathon in April 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers cross-examined no witnesses those first two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>What could they ask, anyway?</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>By acknowledging in their opening statement that Tsarnaev was the perpetrator, they underlined that the defence's focus is strictly to highlight the influence of Dzhokhar's older brother, Tamerlan, who died in the manhunt immediately following the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>But in efforts to keep Dzhokhar from the death penalty, his lawyers will need to win a degree of sympathy from jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>In the prosecution's opening statement, they described the activity of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 20 minutes after the bombs went off, while those on Boylston still bled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Tsarnaev, they said, went to a nearby Whole Foods grocery and bought a big carton of milk, later returning to try and exchange it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Exiting the courthouse at the end of the trial's second day, I happened to step into the elevator alongside Tsarnaev's two main lawyers, who were wrapped tight in thick scarves and winter coats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>They stood silently watching the floor numbers go down.</td></tr>
