<h3>Cardinal George admitted to hospital for tests</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cardinal George takes questions at a news conference after receiving the Gaudium et Spes from the Knights of Columbus (their highest possible award) at the Four Seasons Hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cardinal George processes out of Holy Name Cathedral for the final time as Chicago's archbishop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cardinal George makes his final communion as Chicago archbishop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Cardinal Francis George has been admitted to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood for a battery of tests since doctors stopped treating his cancer more than a month ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>George, who retired as archbishop in November, was admitted Sunday and "will stay for several days of tests to evaluate his condition," the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago said in a statement Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The cardinal continues to count on the prayers of so many who have written to wish him God's blessings," according to the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many of those prayers have come from those who have stayed in touch through George's occasional blog, the Cardinal's Network, which has been on hiatus since his diagnosis but which the archdiocese relaunched Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Over a year ago, as my treatment for cancer intensified, I found myself unable to contribute personally to this network of electronic relationships," George posted Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Now in my retirement, I would like to begin a new chapter in the life of the network, changing its name to 'Cardinal George's Network' and committing myself to one or two reflections a week on faith, spirituality and discipleship," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In December, the archdiocese announced that the 78-year-old cardinal had been dropped from a clinical trial group that was being given an antibody drug after scans showed it had not contained or reduced his cancer, according to the archdiocese.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dr. Gary Steinberg, director of urologic oncology at the University of Chicago Medical Center, said the experimental treatment aims to boost the immune system to fight the cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Steinberg, who has not treated George, speculated that the cardinal was likely dropped because doctors detected a progression of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"A stable disease, complete regression or partial regression - all of those things are reasonable," Steinberg said, "but when you have progressive disease it's clear indication the therapy is not working."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>George was initially diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At that time, Steinberg was optimistic that the cardinal could overcome the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Tuesday, Steinberg was less optimistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In August 2012, George learned that the disease had returned to his kidney and liver, in the form of urothelial cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The cancer was in remission for more than a year when George revealed last March that the disease "is beginning to show signs of new activity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"This is a difficult form of the disease," the cardinal wrote at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"And it will most probably eventually be the cause of my death."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The form of cancer that struck George in 2006, called carcinoma in situ, was relatively unusual, accounting for about 10 percent of bladder cancer cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The tumor was considered superficial - a flat growth limited to the wall of the bladder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But urothelial cancer cells can be aggressive, Steinberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Rather than manifesting through the growth of a tumor, urothelial cancer cells infiltrate soft tissue around the lungs, liver and bone, often causing intense pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>George has been receiving palliative care in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"It's a dreadful, dreadful disease," Steinberg said, adding that the typical prognosis at this stage of the disease without treatment is two to four months.</td></tr>

<h3>Kenya destroy 15 tons of ivory taken from poachers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta set fire to the elephant ivory during World Wildlife Day to discourage poaching, saying that 25 years after the historic banning of the ivory trade, new demand from emerging markets is threatening Africa's elephants and rhinos.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Kenya's president set fire to 15 tons of elephant tusks during World Wildlife Day Tuesday to discourage poaching and trade in ivory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Twenty-five years since ivory trade was banned, new demand from emerging markets threatens Africa's elephants and rhinos, President Uhuru Kenyatta said at the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>African countries are concerned about the scale and rate of the new threat to endangered wildlife species, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Many of these tusks belonged to elephants which were wantonly slaughtered by criminals. We want future generations of Kenyans, Africans and the entire world to experience the majesty and beauty of these magnificent beasts. Poachers and their enablers will not have the last word," Kenyatta said before setting a blaze an almost 10 feet high pile of huge elephant tusks doused with petrol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Higher demand for ivory is fueling elephant killings by poachers across Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Save The Elephants said last year that 100,000 elephants were killed in Africa between 2010 and 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Thursday, China imposed a one-year ban on ivory imports amid criticism that its citizens' huge appetite for ivory threatens the existence of Africa's elephants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Save the Elephants founder, Ian Douglas Hamilton, said research released by his organization showed that the price of elephant ivory has tripled in China since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hamilton said Kenya has a long way to go before it can be clear of the poaching menace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The elephant populations in Tanzania, Gabon, Cameroun, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Republic of Congo and Congo are the worst hit by poaching, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The years 2011, 2012 and 2013 witnessed the highest levels of poaching since a poaching crisis in the 1980s, Kenya's Wildlife Service has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Poaching declined last year with 164 elephants and 35 rhinos killed, down from 302 elephants and 59 rhinos killed in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Officials attributed the decline partially to stiffer penalties adopted last year for those involved in the illegal wildlife business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We would like to tell the world to stop the trade in ivory because it is destroying our economy, our heritage, our environment," said Paul Udoto, a spokesman for the Kenya Wildlife Service.</td></tr>
