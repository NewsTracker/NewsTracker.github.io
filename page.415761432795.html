<h3>Settlement reached in lawsuit filed by Ferguson protesters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. District Judge Carol Jackson dismissed the lawsuit Thursday at the request of both sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The settlement also calls for her to supervise the case through 2017, to ensure the agencies comply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jackson issued a temporary restraining order in December requiring police to provide "reasonable" warning before using tear gas on a crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Protesters sued over the "unified command" that handled security at the protests sparked by the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The command was comprised of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, St. Louis County police and St. Louis police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar and Missouri Highway Patrol Capt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ronald S. Johnson agreed to the settlement terms, according to the judge's dismissal order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>St. Louis police on Thursday directed questions about the settlement to Maggie Crane, a spokeswoman for St. Louis' mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Crane didn't immediately return phone calls Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Messages also were left with the plaintiffs' attorneys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Brown, who was black, was unarmed when he was killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who is white, during a confrontation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice cleared Wilson of wrongdoing, though he resigned from the department in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Under the protesters' lawsuit settlement, officers will be required to provide "clear and unambiguous warnings" before tear gas is used and allow people sufficient time to leave the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Police also must seek to minimize the impact on those complying, and ensure a safe escape path.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Police also agreed not to use tear gas against lawful protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Each agency also agreed to pay $2,500 in legal costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Three protesters testified during a December hearing that they were subjected to tear gas and improper treatment by officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police witnesses countered that their tactics were necessary to prevent looting and potentially save lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>St. Louis City Counselor Winston Calvert said after the December ruling that it was consistent with existing policy of the city's police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He called it a "common-sense order that will allow the St. Louis Police Department to continue to protect protesters' constitutional rights, keep people safe and protect people's homes and businesses."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Suhr reported from Kansas City, Missouri.</td></tr>
