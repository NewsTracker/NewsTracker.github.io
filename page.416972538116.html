<h3>CANNES WATCH: Watts into feathers; Coens not into TV</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Premieres, parties, pretty people and paparazzi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>All come together at the annual Cannes Film Festival on the French Riviera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Feathers helped the Cannes Film Festival take flight on the opening-night red carpet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Naomi Watts, who appears in Gus van Sant's festival entry "The Sea of Trees," wore a powder blue gown from Elie Saab Couture's spring-summer 2015 collection, its top festooned with sequins and pearls above a flowing feathered skirt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Not to be outdone, Julianne Moore wore a silk gauze column dress by Georgio Armani Prive, adorned with aqua and black Swarovski embroidery and paired with a black feathered top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The flame-haired actress, who won Cannes' best-actress prize last year for "Maps to the Stars," offset the look with bold emerald earrings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Natalie Portman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Sienna Miller also walked the Riviera red carpet ahead of Wednesday's gala screening of Emmanuelle Bercot's "Standing Tall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Don't ask the Coen brothers about TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They're not watching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Joel and Ethan Coen are presidents of the jury that will decide the Cannes Film Festival top honor, the Palme d'Or.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Introducing their jury, which includes Jake Gyllenhaal and Guillermo del Toro, the filmmaking brothers confessed Wednesday they remain outsiders to the much-celebrated rise of TV dramas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's not that I don't like TV," said Ethan Coen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's alien to me. I haven't watched a television show in decades."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Joel suggested he was no less familiar, despite his wife, Frances McDormand, recently starring in the acclaimed HBO miniseries "Olive Kitteridge."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''You're going to get me in trouble," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Coens' 1996 film "Fargo" was turned into the FX series, but with little input from them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On the increase of new digital avenues like Netflix for movie watching, Joel wasn't much more enthusiastic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"How do we feel about people watching 'Lawrence of Arabia' on their iPhone?" he said, archly rephrasing a more general question about digital media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"There's something special about sitting with a big crowd of people watching a movie on a big 80-foot screen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>French acting icon Catherine Deneuve is a cinema supernova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And she says they don't make stars like they used to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Deneuve told reporters in Cannes Wednesday that glamour needs mystery, and that's hard to achieve now that social media has blurred the boundary between private and public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Deneuve said the all-revealing nature of celebrity culture doesn't "let people dream anymore" about celebrities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The private lives of actors and actresses are displayed around the globe," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"People even post up their own private photos on these social networks, and I find that a pity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Deneuve's message fits with the mood of a Cannes festival that is trying to eradicate selfies - another symbol of our oversharing age - from the red carpet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Deneuve made her Cannes debut in 1964 in multicolored musical "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The 71-year-old star plays a family-court judge trying to tame a teenage tearaway in this year's festival opener, Emmanuelle Bercot's "Standing Tall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The 68th Cannes Film Festival runs to May 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>EDITOR'S NOTE - "Cannes Watch" brings you the Cannes Film Festival and related events through the eyes and ears of AP reporters around Cannes and around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Follow them on Twitter where available with the handles listed after each item.</td></tr>
