<h3>No precedent for Netanyahu's contentious speech to Congress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a speech that stirred political intrigue in two countries, Netanyahu told Congress that negotiations underway between Iran and the U.S. would "all but guarantee" that Tehran will get nuclear weapons, a step that the world must avoid at all costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Given anywhere else, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech Tuesday wouldn't have caused such a ruckus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But a foreign leader denouncing President Barack Obama's policy from within the grand hall of American democracy upended nearly two centuries of tradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A joint meeting of Congress, gathering senators and representatives together in the House chamber, is a ceremony typically bestowed on one or two friendly foreign leaders per year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It looks a lot like a presidential State of the Union address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The speaker embodies his or her nation; the audience of lawmakers represents all Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Unity and shared purpose are the standard themes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Standing ovations are a given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It establishes there is a strong bond between the two nations," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In that context, a speech that provokes controversy at home or abroad is problematic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So leaders speaking against the backdrop of the chamber's 8-foot-tall American flag tend to gloss over national differences and steer clear of internal politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some of these speeches are powerful - think Winston Churchill rallying Americans for a long, hard war or Nelson Mandela calling them to lead all humanity toward democracy and peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Others, frankly, are so bland they're dull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's not unusual for staffers and student pages to be sent in to fill the seats of lawmakers who didn't bother showing up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Netanyahu's appearance, in contrast, was so contentious that more than four dozen Democratic lawmakers announced they were staying away in protest, despite the nation's close ties to Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Still, demand for seats in the chamber and visitors' gallery was fierce, and Netanyahu was welcomed with enthusiastic ovations and cheers, especially from Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Netanyahu said he was morally obliged to speak out in hopes of stopping what he called the "bad deal" the U.S. is in the midst of negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Before the address, the White House complained that House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had violated protocol by inviting Netanyahu without first consulting the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Boehner responded that Americans needed to hear Netanyahu's fears that Iran will get nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>History offers scant precedent for Netanyahu's contentious speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The tradition of inviting foreign dignitaries dates to the Marquis de Lafayette, the French hero of the American Revolution, who gave separate speeches to the House and Senate in 1824.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It took another 50 years for the two bodies to come together to hear a foreigner - King Kalakaua, of what was then the Kingdom of Hawaii.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Since World War II, these joint meetings - similar to the "joint sessions" that hear U.S. presidents - have become the favored venue for foreign leaders and dignitaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Usually their appearances get more notice back home than among Americans, which made Netanyahu's address before a cheering Congress just two weeks before he's up for re-election in Israel even more controversial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Israel is one of a few allies that dominate the rostrum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>With Netanyahu's return, it ties Britain and France at eight speeches apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In all, 110 foreigners and a handful of Americans - mostly early-Space Age astronauts - have addressed joint meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>As Australian prime minister in 2011, Julia Gillard nailed the mutual-admiration genre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Her voice breaking, Gillard recalled being a small girl amazed that Americans had landed on the moon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"On that great day I believed Americans could do anything," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I believe that still."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The closest comparison to Netanyahu's latest speech to Congress may be Netanyahu's last speech to Congress.</td></tr>

<h3>Businesses Balk at Obamacare Definition of Full-Time Work</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A couple signs up for Obamacare in Miami, in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Restaurant groups say the law's requirement that employees who work 30 hours a week be covered will discourage companies from hiring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The controversy over what counts as a full-time job under the Affordable Care Act continues, especially for those in the service industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lawmakers and several service industry associations are contesting the provision in President Barack Obama's signature health care law known as the employer mandate, saying it is harmful for American workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The mandate defines a full-time employee as a person who works on average 30 hours weekly, and requires that business with 50 or more full-time employees provide health insurance to at least 95 percent of those workers and their dependents up to age 26, or pay a fee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Lots of people who are working part-time now want to have full-time jobs, and that's made more difficult by this provision of the health care law that discourages employers from hiring or keeping full-time employees," said Jack Mozloom, spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The NFIB, some restaurant associations and certain community colleges support legislation in the House and Senate that aims to change the definition of a full-time employee to one working an average of 40 hours a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Without such an alteration to the ACA, Republican-led lawmakers claim, there could be a devastating economic impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The inevitable result is going to be fewer full-time employees, and I really don't see how the other side can argue with that logic unless they completely misunderstand business," Mozloom said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Restaurant owners are also particularly concerned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Thousands of jobs are at stake with the continuation of the provision, Sam Toia, CEO of the Illinois Restaurant Association, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Because of the Affordable Care Act's arbitrary 30-hour-per-week definition of a full-time employee, restaurants are being forced to restructure their workforce by reducing their employees' hours," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Employees are losing the mobility and flexibility in their schedules they normally would enjoy when working at a restaurant. Opportunities are decreasing for young and inexperienced workers to gain entry-level employment and advance into a fulfilling career in the restaurant and hospitality industry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Karen Bremer, executive director of the Georgia Restaurant Association, said when she worked her way through college, having flexible hours allowed her to work less when she needed time to study for finals and work more during the holidays when others wanted time off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Less flexibility would mean workers had fewer opportunities to learn certain "soft skills."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We're the industry that teaches America how to come to work on time, how to smile, how to work on a team with other people, to follow orders, and to make change and to provide customer service. We do a great service to the United States in terms...of teaching those soft skills," Bremer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But Gary Burtless, an economist who researches the labor market policy at the Brookings Institution, said changing the employer mandate would hurt workers, not help them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>By raising the amount of hours classifying a full-time employee to 40 hours a week, employers are incentivized to cut workers hours to avoid providing health insurance, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Since those who work 40 hours per week represent a larger part of the workforce, the proposed alterations would do more harm than good, he explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The whole rationale for this is so completely flipped on its head economically," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"They basically want to exempt most, a huge share of employment in the United States, from mandatory coverage under the Affordable Care Act".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The restaurant industry isn't the only one struggling with the mandate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some community colleges, like Ivy Tech Community College in Indiana, worry that the provision will make it difficult to find faculty members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We are challenged to find credentialed faculty in certain areas and if we are limited in the hours we can provide such faculty, it only makes that challenge more difficult and could put us in a position where we cannot (offer) many courses in some of the disciplines," Ivy Tech spokesman Jeff Fanter said in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Julie Garcia, director of human services at Northern Virginia Community College, said the provision has not plagued her college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But she understands how it could impact smaller schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Costs for personnel, the largest part of colleges' workforce, rise every year, Garcia said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Managing this is difficult, especially for a small team juggling other things, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The 30-hour provision has resulted in a smaller number of "classified part-time" employees, who work between 30 and 40 hours at NOVA, Garcia said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Save American Workers Act of 2015 passed the House in January without Republican dissension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It is currently in the Senate Finance Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Forty Hours is Full Time Act, however, is still stalled in a Senate committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Obama has vowed to veto any legislation aiming to change the definition of a full-time employee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance," the president said."And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it."</td></tr>
