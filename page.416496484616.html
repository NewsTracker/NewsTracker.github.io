<h3>Hillary Clinton plans campaign trip to Nevada</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LAS VEGAS (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton will travel to Nevada next month, adding it to the roster of early-voting states she is visiting at the beginning of her presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A campaign official said the former secretary of state will visit Nevada on May 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Her events will be similar to the small-scale sessions with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The official did not provide any more details of the Nevada events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nevada's caucuses are held early in the presidential nominating calendar, and like Iowa and New Hampshire it is expected to be a hotly-contested battleground state in the general election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton's Nevada stop comes the day before she begins a three-day fundraising swing through California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton, the expected Democratic presidential nominee, traveled through Iowa and New Hampshire in a van and held small question-and-answer sessions with voters in those states earlier this month.</td></tr>
