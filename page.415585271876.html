<h3>NH lawmakers kill 4th-grader's bill to change State Raptor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 9- and 10-year-olds, from Lincoln Akerman School, proposed House Bill 373, to establish the Red Tail Hawk as the New Hampshire state raptor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bill made it past the Environment and Agricultural committee with a majority vote, but some representatives like Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Warren Groen, a Republican from Rochester, weren't quite as receptive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It grasps them with its talons then uses its razor sharp beak to basically tear it apart limb by limb, and I guess the shame about making this a state bird is it would serve as much better mascot for Planned Parenthood," Groen said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Rep. John Burt, a Republican from Goffstown, was also against the proposed bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Bottom line, if we keep bringing more of these bills, and bills, and bills forward that really I think we shouldn't have in front of us, we'll be picking a state hot dog next," Burt said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The bill ended up being killed in a 133-to-160 vote.</td></tr>
