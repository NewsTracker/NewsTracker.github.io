<h3>Ukraine Says Radiation Levels Not Affected by Chernobyl Fire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There has been no change in background radiation levels in the Ukrainian capital as a result of nighttime fires in woodlands in the exclusion zone around the destroyed Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian authorities said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The emergency services agency said in a statement that isotope levels in surface soil and water are within the norm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Authorities in neighboring Belarus, which lies adjacent to the exclusion zone, said it too had detected no change in radiation in its southern regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, lies less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) downriver from the zone around Chernobyl, which was heavily contaminated by radiation from the 1986 reactor explosion and fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A 30-kilometer (18.6-mile) zone around the plant is off-limits to most people except for workers constructing a new shelter to cover the destroyed reactor's building, and to visitors on short trips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities said Tuesday evening's fire swept through 400 hectares (1.5 square miles) of woodland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Belarus was hardest hit by the Chernobyl accident with 70 percent of the country's territory affected to some extent by radiation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Yury Golikov, head of the information department at the Belarus state center for radiation pollution, said that a blaze at least half the size of that seen in 1986 would be required to lead to a change in background radiation levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ukrainian officials warned Tuesday evening that the situation could be complicated by the strong winds blowing the fire in the direction of the plant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the winds had died down later in the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Security was tightened around the perimeter of the exclusion zone amid suspicions the blaze had been sparked intentionally, Avakov said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Patrols have been stepped up. National Guard and Interior Ministry units have been placed on high alert," he said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Yuras Karmanau in Minsk, Belarus, contributed to this report.</td></tr>
