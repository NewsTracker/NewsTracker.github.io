<h3>Germanwings plane crash: pilot locked out of cockpit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Voice recordings recovered from one of the black boxes from the downed Germanwings flight 4U9525 reportedly reveal fresh clues to the plane's demise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Paris: As officials struggled to explain why a jet with 150 people on board crashed in relatively clear skies, an investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane's descent and was unable to get back in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A senior military official involved in the investigation described "very smooth, very cool" conversation between the pilots during the early part of the flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Then the audio indicated that one of the pilots left the cockpit and could not re-enter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>French investigators sift through wreckage at the crash site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The guy outside is knocking lightly on the door and there is no answer," the investigator said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"And then he hits the door stronger and no answer. There is never an answer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said: "You can hear he is trying to smash the door down."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While the audio seemed to give some insight into the circumstances leading up to the crash, it also left many questions unanswered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Night falls on the alps near the area where the plane crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We don't know yet the reason why one of the guys went out," said the official, who requested anonymity because the investigation is continuing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"But what is sure is that at the very end of the flight, the other pilot is alone and does not open the door."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The data from the voice recorder seems only to deepen the mystery surrounding the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The plane's descent from 38,000 feet over about 10 minutes was alarming but still gradual enough to indicate that the twin-engine Airbus A320 had not been damaged catastrophically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At no point during the descent was there any communication from the cockpit to air traffic controllers or any other signal of an emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The French aviation authorities have made public very little, officially, about the nature of the information that has been recovered from the audio recording, and it was not clear whether it was partial or complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>France's Bureau of Investigations and Analyses confirmed only that human voices and other cockpit sounds had been detected and would be subjected to detailed analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Germanwings A320 crashed in a remote section of the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Asked about the new evidence revealed in the cockpit recordings, Martine del Bono, a bureau spokeswoman, declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Our teams continue to work on analysing the CVR," she said, referring to the cockpit voice recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"As soon as we have accurate information we intend to hold a press conference."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Data leaked on Wednesday showed that French air traffic controllers tried three times to radio the cockpit of the stricken Airbus A320, without any response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The German newspaper Bild published a leaked copy of a timeline, compiled by French air traffic controllers, which showed that their repeated attempts to radio the cockpit during the fateful descent had been unsuccessful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The captain's last communication with the ground was at 10.30am local time when he confirmed instructions to continue on the planned flight path, having reached the cruising altitude of 38,000 feet at that point, half an hour into the flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>At 10.31am, when the aircraft began descending without approval, air traffic controllers tried to radio the cockpit on its assigned radio frequency, without success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Four minutes later, an attempt to contact the aircraft on the international distress frequency also failed to elicit a response, and a minute after that, at 10.36am, there was another failed attempt to use the distress frequency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The aircraft disappeared from the radar at 10.40am, having flown into a mountainside at 690 km/h on a steady downward trajectory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A senior French official involved in the investigation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the lack of communication from the pilots during the plane's descent was disturbing, and that the possibility that their silence was deliberate could not be ruled out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"I don't like it," said the French official, who cautioned that his initial analysis was based on the very limited information currently available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"To me, it seems very weird: this very long descent at normal speed without any communications, though the weather was absolutely clear."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The French aviation authorities have recovered an audio file from the cockpit voice recorder, but did not say whether it was partial or complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>This official said that the lack of communication suggested that the pilots might have been incapacitated as a result of an onboard failure such as a loss of cabin pressure, which could have deprived the crew members of oxygen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>While all pilots are equipped with emergency oxygen masks, the pilots would first have to be aware that a depressurisation had occurred, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"If for any reason they don't detect the problem in time, they would black out," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"So far, we don't have any evidence that points clearly to a technical explanation," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"So we have to consider the possibility of deliberate human responsibility."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Remi Jouty, the director of the French Bureau of Investigations and Analysis said it was far too early in the investigation to speculate about possible causes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"At this moment I have no beginning of a scenario," Mr Jouty said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>However, he said there was not yet any evidence available that would support either a theory of a depressurisation or of a midair explosion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, has characterised the crash as an accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The airline has not disclosed the identities of the pilots, except to say that the captain was a 10-year veteran with more than 6000 hours of flying time in A320s.</td></tr>
