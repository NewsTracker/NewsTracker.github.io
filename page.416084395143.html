<h3>'Suge' Knight given time to hire new lawyer, appears in court in wheelchair</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Knight appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom on Wednesday April 8, 2015, in a wheelchair and was given time by a judge to hire a new attorney to represent him in a robbery case filed against him and comedian Katt Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A judge on Wednesday gave former rap music mogul Marion "Suge" Knight time to hire a new attorney in a robbery case filed after a celebrity photographer accused him and comedian Katt Williams of taking her camera last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a separate case, Knight has been charged with murder in a deadly hit-and-run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Death Row Records co-founder appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom chained to a wheelchair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He complained to Judge Ronald Coen, saying he could walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Knight fell at his previous court hearing and has been taken from courthouses four times for medical conditions since he was charged with murder in early February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The judge promised Knight, 49, that he would not be brought into court in the wheelchair again as long as he was fit to walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Coen pressed Knight about whether he wanted a new attorney in the robbery case.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Knight's attorney Matt Fletcher said he expects the hearing, during which prosecutors will present some of the evidence in the case, will go forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fletcher said the wheelchair used at Wednesday's hearing seemed to be an effort to humiliate Knight, who told Coen he walked from his jail cell onto the bus and walked into the courthouse before being placed in the chair.</td></tr>
