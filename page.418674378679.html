<tr><td>27</td><td>For most recession-weary Greeks, Monday was all about the price of goods in the shops as new tax rises demanded by creditors on everything from coffee to taxis took effect.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>"I can't put up my prices because I'll have no customers at all," said Chronis, who said sales have slid by around 80 percent since banking restrictions were imposed June 29.</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>There are few parts of the Greek economy left untouched by the increase in sales taxes on many basic goods from 13 percent to 23 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>They have been imposed on many basic goods, from cooking oils to condoms, through to popular services, such as eating out at restaurants and ferries to the Greek islands.</td></tr>

<tr><td>37</td><td>The European Union also sent a three-month loan to Athens to pay a 4.2 billion-euro debt due to the ECB Monday and clear its arrears with the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"I can confirm that Greece today repaid the totality of its arrears," IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"Greece is therefore no longer in arrears to the IMF."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Rice said the IMF "stands ready to continue assisting Greece in its efforts to return to financial stability and growth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The IMF is not directly involved in Greece's request for a third bailout as its previous rescue runs until early next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>But it has expressed doubts on the measures that Greece's European creditors are demanding without significant debt relief for Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The higher taxes formed a key plank of last week's bailout agreement between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and European creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Following months of growing distrust, Greece's partners in the 19-country eurozone wanted to see measures enacted before bailout talks could begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Other austerity measures included cuts to pensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The green light to the opening of discussions, which are expected to last around a month, was given Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>They will include economic targets and reforms deemed necessary in return for an anticipated 85 billion euros ($93 billion) over three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Though the potential bailout has eased fears of a potential Greek exit from the euro, capital controls of some sort are expected to remain in place for months if not years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The controls were introduced because negotiations with creditors had reached an impasse, fueling fears of a Greek exit from the euro and a bank run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>On Monday, the first easing saw banks reopen their doors for limited services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>There were no reports of any problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Though the daily cash withdrawal limit stayed at 60 euros ($65), the government has given individuals a new weekly limit of 420 euros from this coming Sunday so they don't need to trudge to the ATM every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Since the Greek parliament passed the austerity measures demanded, creditors have relieved the pressure on Greece, though the country's acute difficulties were evident in the fact that the Athens Stock Exchange remained closed with no indication of when it will reopen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Further relief for Greece may come if lawmakers back another set of creditor-demanded measures on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Paying off the IMF and ECB will give Greece some breathing space but the country will need bailout funds to meet upcoming debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Some of the bailout money will also go to restoring the financial health of the banks, which would help speed up the removal of the controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The agreement to open up bailout discussions has not gone down well in large parts of Tsipras' radical left Syriza party, which was elected in January on a promise to end austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Cabinet-level dissenters were replaced Friday, but even their replacements have angrily denounced the new austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>"The government was obliged to make a tactical retreat to save the country," new Labor Minister Giorgos Katrougalos said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>"This was the result of a soft, post-modern financial coup that was handled by the prime minister in a responsible way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Getting the Greek economy back to normal will take time though especially as credit - the lifeblood of a modern economy - remains restricted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Louka Katseli, head of the Greek Banking Association, said Monday it was too early to say how long the cash controls would last, adding that there wouldn't have been a problem if people hadn't taken their money out of the banks.</td></tr>
