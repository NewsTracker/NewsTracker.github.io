<h3>Greece PM Tsipras fights party rebellion as Athens prepares for crunch bail-out vote</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GREEK Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was facing a rebellion in his own party as his crisis-hit country prepares for its second vote on urgently needed reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Introduction of harsh austerity measures, including tax hikes and budget reductions, last week saw a backlash within the Syriza party and only got through thanks to backing from pro-EU opposition MPs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The PM has confronted his critics in a desperate attempt to quell any further protest as the parliament tonight prepares for its second package of reforms, which cover rules for dealing with failed banks and speeding up the justice system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They are both conditions set out by the eurozone and International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Greece to get access to a 86billion ( 60bn) rescue loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Although the reforms look set to be voted through Mr Tsipras is under huge pressure after 32 of his party refused to back the vote last week and more could this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The PM told the rebel MPs the Greek people had "pinned their hopes" on the party to find a solution to the debt crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Health Minister Panagiotis Kouroumplis told Greek TV: "We are making an effort to have fewer dissenters."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the hardline left of the Syriza party, who opposed last week's bill, said they will reject this week's law as well and they complained about the length of the law, which covered more than 900 pages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Tsipras himself, who is associated with the moderate wing of his party, has publicly said he disagrees with measures demanded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But after he made a U-turn by accepting a deal at the 11th hour to keep his country in the euro, he told party hardliners on they should face reality and back the package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Together with his coalition partners from the right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks, Mr Tsipras has 162 seats in the 300-seat parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But last week's rebellion cut his support to just 123 votes and government officials have said elections are likely in September or October once the package is agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said it was "extremely important" tonight's vote can pass through so talks on the bail-out can begin before the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dissent also continued on the streets of the Greek capital where several thousands rallied in front of parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, eyewitnesses said the violence of last week, which included petrol bombs being hurled at the legislature in Athens, was not being repeated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The country received a boost from the European Central Bank earlier tonight when officials increased the emergency liquidity available to Athens by 900million ( 630m).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greece showed signs of returning to normal on Monday when banks reopened after being closed for almost three weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Holidaymakers, however, are still being warned to take cash on trips to the crisis country.</td></tr>
