<h3>Your guide to trying on, ordering Apple Watch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The smartwatch is Apple's first new product category in five years and comes in 54 configurations - more than any other Apple gadget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>So starting Friday, Apple stores will have staff trained to help you choose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Even after the watch starts shipping on April 24, you'll still have to book a try-on visit to buy the watch in stores and wait for it to arrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There's no walking in and walking out with a watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Of course, you can bypass all this by ordering online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>No smartwatch has gotten as much attention as the Apple Watch, given Apple's devoted fan base and the company's knack for designing products consumers can't live without.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By insisting on customers ordering ahead of time, Apple can manage inventory at its stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prices range from $349 to $17,000 depending on the watch case, band and size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A standard model with the cheapest band costs $549 for the 38-millimeter model and $599 for the 42-millimeter version, as measured on the watch face from top to bottom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Here's what you need to know about buying one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If you know the specific configuration you want, you're best off ordering it online, starting at 12:01 a.m. PDT Friday (3:01 a.m. EDT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They will start to ship on April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Popular models might not be available right away if you're not among the first to order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Your watch will get shipped to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There won't be an in-store pick-up option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Besides the United States, the watch is available to customers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Starting Friday, Apple Store staff will be able to help you choose from the array of options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Apple recommends that you make a reservation to see a sales representative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Apple will start taking reservations through its website at 12:01 a.m. PDT Friday as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Appointments will be in 15-minute increments, though you can take more time at the store if you need.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>You might be able to walk in and try one out, but initially there will likely be a long wait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Once you choose, you'll still need to place the order online, though you can do that at a Web terminal inside the store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Again, your only option is to have the watch shipped, at least for the foreseeable future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>For the most part, watches will be available for viewing when stores open Friday, so many overseas stores will actually show the watch before orders are accepted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Apple's 24-hour store on New York's Fifth Avenue will close temporarily to set up the displays; it will reopen at 9 a.m. Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Only some stores will carry the 18-karat gold luxury models known as Edition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>When you make the try-on reservation, you'll have to specify whether you're looking for these models or the cheaper ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Specialists will handle these luxury appointments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>If you're just interested in seeing them, all stores will have them available for viewing in glass cases.</td></tr>
