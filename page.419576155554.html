<h3>Palmyra: Islamic State publishes images of Syria temple destruction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamic State have released pictures purporting to show the destruction of the 2000-year-old temple of Baalshamin in Syria's ancient city of Palmyra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Beirut: Islamic State militants published photos on Tuesday purporting to show the destruction of a Roman-era temple in the central Syrian city of Palmyra, an act the UN cultural agency UNESCO has called a war crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Five photos were distributed on social media showing explosives being carried inside, being set around the walls of the temple, the large explosion and then rubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The militants blew up the temple of Baalshamin on Sunday, according to the Syrian antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim, but had not published pictures until now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Reuters could not independently verify the images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Militants lay explosives around the temple complex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The temple was built nearly 2000 years ago and UNESCO has described it as a symbol of Syria's historical cultural diversity, which it says Islamic State is seeking to obliterate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Such acts are war crimes and their perpetrators must be accountable for their actions," UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She also condemned the killing of Khaled al-Asaad, an 82-year-old archaeologist who had looked after Palmyra's UNESCO World Heritage ruins for four decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Islamic State militants in Palmyra also placed explosives on the ancient temple's columns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Abdulkarim said last week Islamic State had beheaded Mr Asaad and hung his body from one of Palmyra's Roman-era columns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Before the capture of Palmyra by Islamic State, Syrian officials said they moved hundreds of ancient statues to safe locations out of concern the militants would destroy them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Islamic State, which holds parts of Syria and Iraq, seized the desert city of Palmyra in May from government forces but had initially left its ancient sites undamaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In June it blew up two shrines that were not part of its Roman-era structures but which it regarded as sacrilegious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It had also used Palmyra's Roman amphitheatre as a place for killing people it accused of being government supporters, according to a Syria monitoring group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Islamic State militants in Palmyra released this photo purporting to show the remains of the Baalshamin temple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Baalshamin temple's inner area was severely damaged by the explosion, which also caused surrounding columns to collapse, according to UNESCO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The art and architecture of Palmyra, standing at the crossroads of several civilisations, is a symbol of the complexity and wealth of the Syrian identity and history," Ms Bokova said.</td></tr>
