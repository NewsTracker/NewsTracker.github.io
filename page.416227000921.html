<h3>Durst 1st federal court appearance scheduled Tue afternoon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Jailed millionaire Robert Durst has his first court appearance in connection with the newest charge against him - a federal charge of possessing a gun after a felony conviction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. District Judge Lance Africk has ordered U.S. Marshals to take temporary custody of Durst by 2 p.m. Tuesday so he can enter a plea on the charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Durst is an estranged member of the wealthy family that owns 1 World Trade Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also faces a murder charge in California and two state weapons charges in Louisiana - one of possessing a .38-caliber revolver after a felony conviction and one of possessing the firearm along with an illegal drug: about 5 ounces of marijuana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend - allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was arrested early March 15, less than 12 hours before HBO aired the final segment of "The Jinx," in which - off camera in a bathroom but with the microphone still live - Durst whispers, "There it is. You're caught!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After about 10 other short sentences and disjointed phrases, he says, "What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Durst is being held without bail in a state prison where the Orleans Parish mental ward is located, because the sheriff's office says experts found him a suicide risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Federal prosecutors moved that part of the case to federal court Monday; Durst's attorneys have not filed their response and have said they would not comment until they do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Durst's lawyers say his arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the conclusion of "The Jinx."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Durst had registered at the Marriott under the name Everette Ward and was lying low while HBO aired the final chapter of his life story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Authorities said they found a passport, a head-and-chest latex mask, a handgun and marijuana in his room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His lawyers say it was searched illegally.</td></tr>
