<h3>Odor homers, gets into testy exchange as Rangers beat Astros (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HOUSTON (AP) -- Texas Rangers manager Jeff Banister certainly didn't like the melee between his team and the Houston Astros on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He'll take the intensity and emotion the team showed in it any day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Rougned Odor homered early, then got into a testy exchange at home plate in the ninth inning that escalated into a shouting match between the managers as the Rangers beat the Astros 7-6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I think you saw some passion from our guys, some emotion from our guys,'' Banister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''One, they're not going to be pushed around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Odor hit a two-run homer in the third and later singled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He came up in the ninth and exchanged words with Houston catcher Hank Conger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Conger moved toward Odor and Texas slugger Prince Fielder raced from the on-deck circle to push the Astros player out of the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both benches and bullpens cleared as Fielder and Houston manager A.J. Hinch jawed in the middle of the scrum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There was some pushing before Banister stepped in front of Fielder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hinch and Banister engaged in a brief shouting match before order was restored and the game resumed with no ejections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Everyone gets shoved in these things; the whole pile moved a couple different times,'' Hinch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Banister and Odor declined to discuss specifics of the incident, but Conger shed some light on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I wasn't too pleased about him taking his time getting in the box and having (Fielder) wait there,'' Conger said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fielder acknowledged he was simply trying to protect Odor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''You just don't want anybody to get hurt, suspensions or anything,'' Fielder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Houston starter Scott Feldman wasn't pleased with the actions of the 21-year-old Odor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''I don't really know that Odor guy much, but he's got some good veterans he can learn the game from over there like (Adrian) Beltre and Prince,'' Feldman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Odor followed with a triple to Tal's Hill in center field and scored on a single by Beltre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Josh Hamilton added an RBI double that extended the lead to 7-4.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>Colby Lewis (9-4) allowed four hits and two runs in 7 1-3 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Feldman (4-5) gave up nine hits and four runs in 5 2-3 innings in his first start since May 26 following arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Jon Singleton singled to start Houston's third before Lewis retired the next 12 in a row, including striking out the side in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Hamilton, who finished with three hits, sent an 86 mph fastball by Joe Thatcher into the bullpen in right-center to push the lead to 5-1 in the eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It was his first home run since hitting his only two of the season on May 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''After my first two (at-bats) I was like: 'I'm going to go up and try to see strikes and be aggressive when I see them and cut it loose instead of kind of feeling for it,''' Hamilton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Hamilton began the game in a 0-for-10 rut with just two hits in his last 21 at-bats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Astros: 1B Chris Carter sat out a day after spraining his ankle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He said the swelling had subsided and he's hopeful that he can avoid a trip to the disabled list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''There's a lot of soreness right now,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Coming off his start in the All-Star game, Houston ace Dallas Keuchel (11-4) will oppose Yovani Gallardo (7-8) when the series wraps up on Sunday.</td></tr>
