<h3>White House Notebook: Kenya says it's no 'hotbed of terror' as Obama opens visit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI, Kenya - Kenyans eager to have their country in the spotlight during President Barack Obama's visit have been irked by a news report describing the East African nation as a "hotbed of terror."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kenyans quickly mobilized a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #SomeoneTellCNN to correct what many here have called an exaggeration by the television network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>President Uhuru Kenyatta even joined in, telling attendees at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit that they will find Kenya to be "a hotbed of vibrant culture, spectacular natural beauty, and a wonderful people with infinite possibility."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The crowd laughed and applauded at his remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kenya has struggled to contain the threat from al-Shabab militants based in neighboring Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Al-Shabab, a group linked to al-Qaeda, has conducted major attacks in Kenya, including the 2013 attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall and an April attack in Garissa town that killed nearly 150 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>CNN later added an editors' note to its story on its website that read: "The headline and lead of this article has been recast to indicate the terror threat is a regional one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kenyan troops are deployed in Somalia to counter al-Shabab, and the United States has carried out drone strikes against suspected militants there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Obama says a major initiative he launched to help Africa double its access to electricity is empowering folks in ways not seen before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Obama commented Saturday while touring five "Power Africa" exhibits on display at the business summit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The initiative's progress has been slow, though, and its future is uncertain because Congress hasn't renewed its major source of funding, the U.S. Export-Import Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some of the exhibits Obama toured used solar panels to help generate electricity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Obama said entrepreneurship combined with the electricity initiative will help Africa "leapfrog" over dirty energy - meaning fossil fuels like coal and oil that must be burned - to cleaner sources of energy, like the sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said ultimately millions of people will have reliable electrical power, which can boost productivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's promising," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>One presenter told Obama that his invention repurposed biofuel, as he showed off a set-up included a device resembling a pot with a hose snaking out from the top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Either that or you're making moonshine," Obama told him.</td></tr>
