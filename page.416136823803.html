<h3>Iowa St coach Fred Hoiberg to have heart valve replaced (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hoiberg skipped the neckwear because it made him dizzy - one of many signs that further heart surgery was inevitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 42-year-old Hoiberg said Friday that he's scheduled to have open heart surgery to replace his aortic valve, a procedure he put off twice during the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hoiberg, who retired from the NBA following the 2004-05 season because of heart issues, will have the surgery next Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hoiberg is the second high-profile person in the Iowa State athletic department to go through serious heart issues in the past month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Athletic director Jamie Pollard is on temporary leave after having a heart attack in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I knew that this was something that would need to be done at some point,'' said Hoiberg, who first replaced his aortic valve in June of 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''My valve has severe regurgitation and the time has come to get it replaced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He just completed his fifth season at Iowa State, leading the Cyclones to four straight NCAA Tournament appearances and back-to-back Big 12 tournament titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hoiberg said Iowa State's success played a part in his decision to ask doctors to push the surgery until April, though he acknowledged that his heart condition was on his mind all year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Cyclones won 25 games last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They rallied to beat rival Kansas in the Big 12 title game and were a trendy Final Four pick before 14th-seeded UAB stunned them in the NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''I can't tell you how lucky I am that I know about this, that I can have this done,'' Hoiberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He is expected to need about 4-6 weeks to recover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He's hopeful he'll be healthy enough to recruit in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hoiberg will return to a team that could be his best yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Cyclones return six of their top eight players in 2015-16 and are expected to open the year in the top 10.</td></tr>
