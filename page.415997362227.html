<h3>Kenya's Easter prayers mark start of official mourning for university attacks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Easter ceremonies across the country were due to be held in the memory of the students and security personnel killed in a country where 80% of the population is Christian, with flags flying at half-mast in a show of respect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Islamist militants lined up non-Muslim students during the massacre on Thursday, taunting them and then executing them in al-Shabaab's bloodiest attack to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>President Uhuru Kenyatta warned they would face justice for the "mindless slaughter" and vowed to retaliate in the "severest way" to the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The siege in the north-eastern town of Garissa, close to the border with Somalia, claimed the lives of 142 students, three police officers and three soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The massacre was Kenya's deadliest attack since the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi, and Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning beginning Sunday, calling for the killings to unite the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Earlier on Saturday, al-Shabaab warned of a "long, gruesome war" unless Kenya withdrew its troops from Somalia, and threatened "another bloodbath".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After the threat, police in Garissa paraded four corpses of the gunmen piled on top of each other face down in the back of a pickup truck followed by a huge crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Police insisted the grim display was to see if anyone could identify the assailants, but some onlookers threw stones at the bodies as they passed, while others jeered and shouted at the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Nairobi's ethnic Somali district demonstrators took to the streets protesting against al-Shabaab, calling for unity in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Five men have been arrested in connection with the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Meanwhile, forensic investigators continued to scour the site where one student emerged unharmed from a wardrobe where she had hidden for over two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Her appearance shocked security forces, who had said all students were accounted for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A Kenya Red Cross spokeswoman said the 19-year old was traumatised and dehydrated, but physically unharmed and undergoing assessment by doctors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Over 600 students from the now closed college boarded buses for home towns around the country on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said five arrests had been made, including three "co-ordinators" captured as they fled towards Somalia, and two others in the university.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The names of the three suspected organisers were not given, but Njoka said the two arrested on campus included a security guard at the university, and a Tanzanian named as Rashid Charles Mberesero, allegedly found "hiding in the ceiling" and holding grenades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A $215,000 ( 150,000) bounty has also been offered for alleged al-Shabaab commander Mohamed Mohamud, a former Kenyan teacher said to be the mastermind behind the Garissa attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Kenyatta said it was clear terrorist masterminds were operating inside Kenya and not just Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Related: Are the terrorists of al-Shabaab about to tear Kenya in two?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Hurling grenades and firing automatic rifles, the gunmen stormed the university at dawn on Thursday as students were sleeping, shooting dead dozens before setting Muslims free and holding Christians and others hostage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Just before darkness fell, Kenyan troops moved in on the dormitory where the gunmen were holed up, apparently determined to prevent a drawn-out siege like that seen in the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in September 2013, also carried out by al-Shabaab fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The militants vowed to carry out more attacks against Kenya, which invaded southern Somalia in 2011 and is now fighting alongside the African Union force battling al-Shabaab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We will ... stop at nothing to avenge the deaths of our Muslim brothers until your government ceases its oppression and until all Muslim lands are liberated from Kenyan occupation," al-Shabaab said in a statement released on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Until then, Kenyan cities will run red with blood ... This will be a long, gruesome war of which you, the Kenyan public, are its first casualties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>On Saturday, US embassy vehicles were seen entering the campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In past attacks, including the Westgate massacre, FBI investigators helped Kenyan police with forensic examinations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Forensics and investigations are still going on," Njoka said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Al-Shabaab on Saturday described how it had specifically singled out non-Muslims to kill, gathering them together before executing them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Survivors who hid from the attack have recounted how the gunmen called on people to come out of their dormitory bedrooms and lie on the ground face down, but then killed them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The mujahedeen stormed the university compound and swiftly proceeded to the halls of residence where they had gathered all the occupants," the al-Shabaab statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"And since the attack targeted only non-Muslims, all Muslims were allowed to safely evacuate the premises before executing the disbelievers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Kenya's National Union of Teachers has called for extra security measures, warning "all teachers in northern Kenya to leave if they feel unsafe".</td></tr>
