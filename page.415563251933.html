<h3>US Fed drops 'patience' pledge and brings interest?rate rise closer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At a press conference following the statement, Chair Janet Yellen told reporters that any decision to raise rates in June would depend on the data as it is made available to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She said: "Just because we removed the word 'patient' does not mean that we are going to be impatient."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Just last month, Ms Yellen said that the Fed would look at increasing the cost of borrowing on a meeting-by-meeting basis, but continued evidence of strong US economic performance may mean a rate rise as soon as June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, the Fed is looking for signs of continued strength in the US jobs market before raising rates, and yesterday noted that growth has "moderated".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The committee also trimmed its economic growth forecasts for the next three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Wall Street rallied on the back of the statement, with the Dow Jones up more than 150 points within minutes of its release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Fed said: "Labour market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment The committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labour market as nearly An increase in the target range for the federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April FOMC meeting."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ms Yellen noted that the US economy remains somewhat mixed, despite several good recent headline numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Similarly to January's post-meeting statement, the Fed highlighted the weak energy market, slower export growth, household spending and below-target inflation as areas of concern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Not only has inflation remained below the long-term 2 per cent target, Ms Yellen told reporters that energy costs - with the oil price slumping since last summer - have driven inflation even lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Fed's more hawkish approach to interest rates is a another sign that the US economy is finally returning to normality after the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Rates have been held at almost zero since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The big takeaway is flexibility, as is the Fed's willingness to watch data as it becomes available," said William Waite, managing director of Semnia, the economics consultancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This takes the handcuffs off, giving them the additional ability to respond as the situation warrants."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Read more: The head of the Fed says it should be apolitical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Others, however, were more cautious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The Fed is in no rush," said Ward McCarthy, chief US economist at Jefferies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The word 'patient' was removed, but the meaning of patient remained."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Markets were cautious ahead of Ms Yellen's statement, in part due to comments made on Tuesday by Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>At an appearance at India's central bank, Ms Lagarde warned of another market "temper tantrum", like the sell-off in 2013 that was sparked by the end of the Fed's quantitative easing programme.</td></tr>

<h3>Producer of latest Bond film denies Mexico changed script</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Earlier, the website Tax Analysts said leaked emails indicated that Mexico made suggestions on the nationality of an actress and the villain, the villain's intended victim and some film shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Implicitly, Mexico's incentives for the film were at stake, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Producer Michael G. Wilson said Wednesday: "There is nothing in the script that we hadn't had before. The villain was always an Italian ... we already shot that in Rome."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Asked about Mexico's purported insistence on a Mexican actress in a role known as "Estrella," Wilson said, "We always had a Mexican actress playing this part."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The film has cast Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman in the role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Officials in Mexico City have declined to comment on possible incentives offered on the movie, which is scheduled to begin its Mexico filming Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Relying on emails leaked as part of the recent hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Tax Analysts said that the target of the villain "Sciarra" should be an international leader rather than Mexico City's mayor and that a "special police force" should appear in the film instead of Mexican police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Wilson confirmed there are incentives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Everywhere we go we have incentives," he said at a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Sometimes they're taxes; sometimes they're other kind of incentives. You can get cooperation, you can get things you would usually pay for for free and all that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But it wasn't just incentives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Wilson confirmed that Mexico's "Day of the Dead" traditions will be seen in the film, or at least a Bond version - "where everything is sort of magnified."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mexicans remember departed relatives and friends on the Day of the Dead at the beginning of November with orange flowers, candy skulls and other death-related decorations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The writers thought the day of the death would be an excellent background in the opening sequence, very colorful, very mysterious," Wilson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"You can only do that in Mexico. There is no other place that offers that but Mexico."</td></tr>
