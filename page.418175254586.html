<h3>US court agrees Apple violated antitrust law in e-book entry</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This June 11, 2015 photo shows the Apple logo on an iMac at an Apple store in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple violated antitrust laws by colluding with publishers to raise electronic book prices when it entered a market in 2010 that had been dominated by Amazon.com, a federal appeals court said Tuesday, June 30, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple violated antitrust laws by colluding with publishers to raise electronic book prices when it entered a market in 2010 that had been dominated by Amazon.com, a divided federal appeals court panel said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled 2-to-1 that a lower-court judge correctly found Apple Inc. violated the law to upset Amazon.com Inc.'s control of the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The appeals court also agreed that U.S. District Judge Denise Cote was right to order injunctive relief to ensure the Cupertino, California-based company didn't commit additional violations of antitrust laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a statement, Apple said the ruling did nothing to change the fact that it did not conspire to fix e-book pricing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are disappointed the court does not recognize the innovation and choice the iBooks Store brought for consumers," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"While we want to put this behind us, the case is about principles and values. We know we did nothing wrong back in 2010 and are assessing next steps."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Cote ruled against Apple after a civil trial in summer 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She ordered the technology giant to modify contracts with publishers to prevent price fixing and appointed a monitor to review the company's antitrust policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The appeals court last month upheld the appointment of the monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a majority opinion written by Judge Debra Ann Livingston, the 2nd Circuit said Cote's finding that Apple orchestrated a conspiracy among publishers to raise electronic book prices was "amply supported and well-reasoned."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We also conclude that the district court's injunction is lawful and consistent with preventing future anticompetitive harms," the appeals court said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In a dissent, Judge Dennis Jacobs defended as "eminently reasonable" the actions Apple took as it fought to raise the price of e-books when Seattle-based Amazon had 90 percent control of the market selling the most popular books online for $9.99.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Afterward, its share of the market dropped to about 60 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said it was a mistake by Cote and his fellow appeals judges to assume "competition should be genteel, lawyer-designed, and fair under sporting rules, and that antitrust law is offended by gloves-off competition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Apple took steps to compete with a monopolist and open the market to more entrants, generating only minor competitive restraints in the process," Jacobs wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the majority opinion, though, Livingston said it was "startling" that Jacobs would agree Apple intentionally organized a conspiracy among publishers to raise e-book prices and then say the company was entitled to do so because the conspiracy helped it become an e-book retailer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Fundamentally, the dissent's theory - that the presence of a strong competitor justifies a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy - endorses a concept of marketplace vigilantism that is wholly foreign to the antitrust laws," Livingston wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"By organizing a price-fixing conspiracy, Apple found an easy path to opening its iBookstore, but it did so by ensuring that market-wide e-book prices would rise to a level that it, and the publisher defendants, had jointly agreed upon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The U.S. Justice Department and 33 states and territories originally sued Apple and five publishers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The publishers all settled and signed consent decrees prohibiting them from restricting e-book retailers' ability to set prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Two publishers joined Apple's appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In a release, Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division said the government was gratified with the ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The decision confirms that it is unlawful for a company to knowingly participate in a price-fixing conspiracy, whatever its specific role in the conspiracy or reason for joining it. Because Apple and the defendant publishers sought to eliminate price competition in the sale of e-books, consumers were forced to pay higher prices for many e-book titles," he said.</td></tr>
