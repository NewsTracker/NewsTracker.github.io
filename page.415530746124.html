<h3>Lawyer for Pakistan doctor who helped CIA find bin Laden shot dead</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Samiullah Afridi represented Dr Shakil Afridi, who was jailed in 2012 for 33 years for running a fake vaccination campaign believed to have helped the U.S. intelligence agency track down bin Laden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That sentence was overturned in 2013 and the doctor is now in jail awaiting a new trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Samiullah Afridi was shot dead on Tuesday as he was returning to his home in the northwestern city of Peshawar, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>According to media, he had recently returned there from abroad after leaving Pakistan for his safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He was returning home when armed men opened fire. He died on the spot," police official Jamal Hussain said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A hospital spokesman added that Samiullah Afridi was shot twice, in the abdomen and the neck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two Pakistan militant groups claimed responsibility for the laywer's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jundullah, a Taliban splinter group, said: "We killed him because he was defending Shakil, who is our enemy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Taliban faction, Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan Jamaatul Ahrar (TTP-JA), later said it had shot him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Dr Shakil Afridi had spied on our respected and supreme leader Sheikh Osama to the CIA," TTP-JA spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Samiullah Afridi had represented his case," Ehsan said, "that's why we decided to eliminate him when we can't approach Dr Shakil."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>U.S. officials have hailed Shakil Afridi as a hero for helping pinpoint bin Laden's location before a 2011 raid by U.S. special forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed the al Qaeda leader after more than a decade of searching for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Samiullah Afridi stopped representing the doctor last year, saying he had become a target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I have been receiving threats from various organizations, and because of those threats I even went to Dubai some time back," he told Reuters TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Some organizations do not want us to continue defending this case ... Not only is my life in danger, my family is also in danger. I have therefore decided to quit this case."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Shakil Afridi's original sentence damaged ties between Pakistan and the United States that were already strained over the bin Laden raid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Angry U.S. senators withheld $33 million in aid from Pakistan in retaliation.</td></tr>
