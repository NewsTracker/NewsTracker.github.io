<tr><td>4</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece's prime minister said his country was in the "final stage" of talks for a new bailout, as his left-wing government on Wednesday rejected the idea of extending the negotiations beyond this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government is racing to complete talks with bailout lenders for a new package of loans worth 85 billion euros ($92 billion) ahead of an Aug. 20 deadline, when it has to make a big debt repayment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is, however, under mounting pressure from dissenters in the ruling Syriza party to abandon the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are at the final stage of completing an agreement with the (creditor) institutions," Greek leader Alexis Tsipras said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His ministers of finance and economy, Euclid Tsakalotos and Giorgos Stathakis, were holding held new meetings with bailout negotiators in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The negotiators are pressing Greece to speed up a program to cut early retirement rights, impose stricter rules for tax arrears payments, and allow stronger creditor oversight of a privatization fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The European Union's executive Commission, one of the main negotiators, said the talks are progressing in a satisfactory way and believes an agreement can reached by Aug. 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This is an ambitious yet possible timetable if everyone sticks to the commitments," the Commission spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lead eurozone lender Germany refused to say whether a deal was possible within that timeframe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"A series of points still have to be cleared up," German Finance Ministry spokesman Marco Semmelmann said.</td></tr>
