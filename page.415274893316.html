<h3>Not stellar noise: Potentially habitable super-Earth Gliese 581d exists, new study claims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A new study shows Gliese 581d had been the victim of bad analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In 2009, as scientists searched for far-away planets that were in the habitable zone orbiting around their host stars, a spectrometer picked up 581d's 'wobble' - which is a slight change in the wavelength of light caused by a celestial body passing by its star and changing the amount of light the star gives off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The now-suspected planet and its siblings orbit a red dwarf named Gliese 581.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Because the distance is some 20 light years from Earth, any determinations on the nature of things are always subject to heated debate among scientists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Last year's study dismissed the discovery as "noise", or interference created by the star system itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Two whole planets that were potentially habitable were dismissed by a study in the journal Science - 581d and 581g, which were discovered at different times orbiting their host star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But a new study published in the same journal wipes the slate clean again and criticizes the previous one as "inappropriate" and "promoting inadequate tools."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Revisiting the 'flawed' data dismissed by Pennsylvania State University, a team from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and University of Hertfordshire proved that just a minor tweak to the technique makes a difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Previous methods could account for only larger celestial bodies, where calculations did not have to be as painstaking and smaller errors went unnoticed, because of the very obvious effect of the planet on the star's light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That is according to Dr Guillem Anglada-Escude, who authored the new paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The existence, or not, of GJ 581d [Gliese 581d] is significant because it was the first Earth-like planet discovered in the 'Goldilocks'-zone around another star and it is a benchmark case for the Doppler technique," he said of the method used to detect spectral shifts in the wavelength of a star's light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There are always discussions among scientists about the ways we interpret data but I'm confident that GJ 581d has been in orbit around Gliese 581 all along. In any case, the strength of their statement was way too strong. If their way to treat the data had been right, then some planet search projects at several ground-based observatories would need to be significantly revised as they are all aiming to detect even smaller planets. One needs to be more careful with these kind of claims."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As part of their advice in the new paper, Anglada-Escude and team recommend a re-evaluation of the standard methods for detecting exo-planets.</td></tr>

<h3>Russia: 2 Suspects Detained in Murder of Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Alexander Bortnikov, in comments shown on state television, said the two suspects were from Russia's North Caucasus region, but gave no details other than their names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said they were "suspected of carrying out this crime," but it was not clear if either of the suspects was believed to have fired the shots that killed Nemtsov as he and a companion walked over a bridge near the Kremlin on Feb. 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>No charges were immediately announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nemtsov's killing shocked Russia's already beleaguered and marginalized opposition supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Suspicion in the opposition is high that the killing was ordered by the Kremlin in retaliation for Nemtsov's adamant criticism of President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 55-year-old was working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Russia's top investigative body said it was investigating several possible motives, including that he was killed in an attempt to smear Putin's image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It also said it was looking into possible connections to Islamic extremism and Nemtsov's personal life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Many believe that Nemtsov's death in a tightly secured area near the Kremlin wouldn't have been possible without official involvement, and could be an attempt to scare other government foes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Putin dubbed Nemtsov's killing a "provocation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One of Nemtsov's closest allies in the opposition, Ilya Yashin, said on Fcebook after the announcement that "It's hard to judge whether these are the real performers of if the investigation went down a false track."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In any case, he said, "it's extremely important that the matter not be limited to detention of the shooters, whether these are the real killers or not. The key task is the identification and detention of who ordered" the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"For the time being, it's very skimpy information, which tells us little, but it's good that the first results of the investigation has appeared," another opposition leader, former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, was quoted as telling the news agency Interfax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In some previous killings of Kremlin critics, especially the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006, there has been wide criticism that those who ordered the killing have not been identified or prosecuted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The North Caucasus region from which the suspects reportedly come includes Chechnya, where two separtatist rebels fought two wars against Russian forces over the past two decades and which now is in under the tight control of Kremlin-backed leader Ramzan Kadyrov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Kadyrov has been widely criticized for brutality against opponents, including summary executions and abductions, and is a vehement defender of Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He blamed Western security services for Nemtsov's killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The suspects were identified as Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>No further information was given about them, but opposition figures unearthed a statement from the Chechen government from 2010 in which a Zaur Dadaev was among the police troops awarded medals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kremlin critics say the spiteful nationalist propaganda on state television, which cast Nemtsov and other liberals as Western stooges, helped prepare the ground for his killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The atmosphere of mad aggression created by the state television & has signaled that you could do anything to the people expressing a different view, this will benefit the Motherland," Dmitry Muratov, the editor of the Novaya Gazeta, a newspaper critical of the Kremlin, told the AP on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Nemtsov was walking with a young Ukrainian woman, Anna Duritskaya, when he was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The woman has returned to Ukraine after questioning by police and the state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday quoted her lawyer Vadim Prokhorov as saying she has not been called back to Russia for testimony in connection with the detentions.</td></tr>
