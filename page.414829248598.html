<h3>As Bali nine duo wait on death row, US states look to bring back firing squad executions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Here it is an accepted means of carrying out the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Utah House of Representatives narrowly passed legislation last week that would allow firing squads to carry out executions in situations where lethal injection drugs could not be procured within 30 days of a planned execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The legislation must now go to the state Senate for approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Getting a sufficient supply of the drugs usually used to carry out lethal injections - the primary method of execution in all states that still administer capital punishment in the USA - has become a significant problem in recent years, after at least two major drugs companies in Europe, which previously exported the substances to the US, refused to continue to do so on the grounds they did not want to be involved in the implementation of capital punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This disruption has led to some states looking either for alternative new drug combinations or other methods of execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Utah Republican Representative Paul Ray is the chief sponsor of the bill, called HB11, which would, in his words, make the firing squad a "back-up" option if the state was unable to procure the drugs required to carry out a lethal injection in the 30 days before a scheduled execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A lethal injection execution chamber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A shortage of the drugs used in lethal injections has led to some US state's exploring alternative methods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He believes it is "definitely more humane" than other methods, and says the State still has the infrastructure to carry it out, given the firing squad was used in the recent past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Until 2004, prisoners sentenced to death could opt to choose the firing squad over lethal injection as method for their own death, with the last execution by firing squad in Utah carried out in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It was not controversial here in Utah," Mr Ray told Fairfax Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It was in Europe and other places, more liberal places, but here it is an accepted means of carrying out the death penalty. The media circus that we get is international press and press from the East Coast here in the US."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, two of the Bali nine members, are facing death by firing squad in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A similar push is gathering pace in Wyoming to reintroduce firing squads, with legislation there also recently passing the State House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An eyewitness report from the 2010 execution of Ronnie Lee Gardner in Utah described how the prisoner was strapped to a chair surrounded by sandbags, with a target affixed to his chest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A journalist from the Associated Press described how Mr Gardner clenched his fists and tried to lift his arms as the bullets tore through him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Critics of the bill oppose it both on the grounds of broad opposition to the death penalty, and concerns about the specific method.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"If not shot in the heart, the prisoner bleeds to death slowly," said Utah Representative Brian King, a Democrat, according to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He also raised concern about the the impact on those in the firing squad who may experience "psychological trauma of participating in a cold-blooded execution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Representative Sandra Hollins, an African American woman and Democrat, objected on the grounds that capital punishment "disproportionately affects my community... [it] also is not fairly given over social economic status, race or gender lines."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Attempts to get around the drug supply shortage through experimentation with new combinations of drugs has led to claims of prolonged, painful botched executions and sparked a Supreme Court Review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Centre (DPIC), told Fairfax Media he believed states pushing for the reintroduction of firing squads would prefer to continue lethal injections, which are viewed as a more "clean" and "modern" and a less controversial method.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Firing squad may be quick but if anything goes wrong then you bleed to death and it's slow, there have been instances in the US where just a slight movement by the inmate caused the shooter to miss the heart and so, slowly, the person dies from loss of blood," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I think they'll find a way to get different drugs or make the drugs themselves, these efforts are an attempt to tell the courts not to interfere with secrecy and trying new drugs," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"If the death penalty is to survive it's got to look at least technologically adept and modern and humane... the firing squad... it's messy, it's loud... it would be very surprising if that became our method."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Support for the death penalty as punishment for murder has dropped substantially in the past few decades in the USA but 55 per cent of Americans remain in favour of the practice, according to a 2013 Pew study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Though lethal injection is the primary method of execution in the US, several states still allow electrocution, gas and hanging, while Oklahoma, like Utah, also allows firing squad in the event lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional, according to the DPIC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, two Australian members of the Bali nine, may soon face a firing squad in Indonesia, although their transfer from Bali has been delayed giving some small amount of hope to their supporters and families.</td></tr>
