<h3>Young forwards, Halak lift Islanders past Caps 4-1 in Game 1 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Entering Wednesday night, the trio of New York Islanders forwards owned these combined career NHL playoff numbers: seven games, zero goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>So much for the supposed importance of postseason experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nelson scored twice, Strome and Bailey added a goal apiece, Jaroslav Halak made 24 saves against a familiar foe, and the Islanders beat Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals 4-1 in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference first-round series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Bailey (2008), Nelson (2010) and Strome (2011) were all first-round draft picks by New York, far-less-heralded than their teammate who went No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>1 overall in 2009, John Tavares, who finished second in the league in points this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But while Tavares did have an assist, it was that other trio that made the biggest impact in the series opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I liked their composure, the way they held their emotions in check, and they came up big for us tonight,'' Islanders coach Jack Capuano said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''They skated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And, you know, they played with confidence and poise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Said Bailey, who added an assist: ''There might have been question marks outside of the dressing room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Game 2 in the best-of-seven series is at Washington on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Capitals will need to figure out a way to slow down New York's transition offense, avoid lengthy lulls, and get more from Ovechkin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The three-time NHL MVP scored 53 goals this season to lead the league for the third year in a row and fifth time overall, but all eight of his shots Wednesday were turned aside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''We're going to have to be a lot sharper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That goes right through the whole lineup,'' Capitals coach Barry Trotz said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Aside from one bad blip - when he lost the puck behind his net, leading to Marcus Johansson's goal in the final minute of the first period - Halak was mostly superb after struggling late in the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There's real history between this goalie and this opponent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Halak stymied Ovechkin and the rest of his Presidents' Trophy-winning Capitals while leading eighth-seeded Montreal to a first-round upset in the 2010 playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Last season, Washington acquired Halak at the trade deadline, but he wasn't able to get them into the postseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Indeed, neither of these teams qualified for the playoffs a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Capitals made it six straight seasons prior to that, although they failed to get past the second round in that span.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''Our desperation level could be a little bit better than it was tonight,'' Washington defenseman Brooks Orpik said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Islanders were aggressive on the penalty kill, holding the Capitals' NHL-best power play to three shots and no goals during two opportunities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There were plenty of problems for Washington, starting with a poor pass by Troy Brouwer about six minutes into the game, a turnover that led to Nelson - who would later add an empty-netter with 79 seconds left - taking a pass from Bailey and putting a wrister past Braden Holtby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''That's not the way we want to start the series - or the game,'' Brouwer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''Some of that is trying to make something happen right away, where sometimes your best option is to play small ball, if you will,'' Trotz said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>NOTES: Play was delayed for about five minutes in the second period while a broken pane of glass behind Holtby's net was replaced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Less than 30 seconds after action resumed, Tavares beat Michael Latta on a faceoff, setting up Strome's goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Trotz said Latta took the faceoff because Eric Fehr was off the ice, dealing with an equipment problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>... New York was without D Travis Hamonic, injured last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He missed the regular-season finale.</td></tr>
