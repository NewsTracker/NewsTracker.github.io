<h3>Pew: Nearly One-Third Of Americans Hide Information Online</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But as a country, we're deeply divided - nearly 50-50 - over whether to be concerned about massive government surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And while there are signs that privacy is a partisan issue, it's not partisan in the way you might think.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>All that is according to the latest privacy study by the Pew Research Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Privacy Market Has Grown - To Critical Mass?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Among the Americans who've heard about the NSA revelations (not everyone has - which is a whole other story!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>, 25 percent say they've changed how they use online technology "a great deal" or "somewhat."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Respondents say things like: "I don't search some things that I might have before" and "Can't joke about stuff that could be taken as a threat."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>People have changed the privacy settings on their Facebook and Twitter accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They've uninstalled mobile apps that are data-moochers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They've used search engines that depart from the norm and do not keep a running tab on every site you visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And some respondents report taking the dramatic step of talking - face to face, in the physical world - to avoid having a digital trail of communication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While one-quarter is not the majority, it is eye-grabbing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Pew study indicates that the niche market for privacy tools may go mainstream.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Companies like Wickr and Dstrux offer self-destructing tools for email and social media posts, with the promise of "zero digital footprint."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Abine Blur let's you shop online without revealing your personal email and credit card number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>These are hardly household names, but that could change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The problem with privacy tools, as reflected in the Pew study, is that they're hard for the average person to use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>For example, search engines that don't record search history, like DuckDuckGo, have been around for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But only 10 percent of respondents say they've used one, and 13 percent don't know these browsers exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While people say they'd like to do more, they also say things like: "I do not feel expert enough to know what to do to protect myself, and to know that the protection chosen is effective. Technology changes very fast."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Clearly there's a lot of work for tech entrepreneurs to do, in terms of marketing their goods and designing them to be more user-friendly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>What Kind Of Partisan Issue Is This?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Politically, we are a nation divided over the government's blanket surveillance of American citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Just over half of respondents say they're concerned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Just under half say: not really.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But here's an interesting tidbit: Republicans and those who lean Republican are more likely than those in the Democrats camp to say they are losing confidence that surveillance programs serve the public interest (70 percent vs. 55 percent).</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It'll be interesting to see how public sentiment shapes up in one emerging debate: While the public and private sectors are both amassing stockpiles of data on us, they are starting to butt heads over encryption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Companies like Yahoo want to encrypt more, to regain consumer trust; and government officials say that gets in the way of intelligence-gathering.</td></tr>

<h3>What is Robert Durst really worth?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He's been called a "real estate baron," a "rich scion" and even a "billionaire."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yet Robert Durst, the real estate heir who was arrested in New Orleans on murder charges, may be none of those things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While Durst is indeed wealthy, which no doubt has helped turn an old unsolved murder into a new media sensation, his wealth is a tiny fraction of the riches held by his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And it's unclear how much wealth he still has after his legal and personal troubles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In this Aug. 15, 2014 file photo, real estate heir Robert Durst leaves a Houston courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The HBO documentary on Durst, called "The Jinx," doesn't give an accounting of his current wealth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yet reports suggest that he's not a billionaire, he's not a real estate baron and while he is a scion, he's been essentially cut out of the family fortune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Read MoreA $60,000 speeding ticket!</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Durst family's real estate empire is worth more than $4 billion, according to the 2014 Forbes list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The family business started in 1915, when Joseph Durst, Robert's grandfather, an Austrian-Jewish immigrant, bought a building on 34th Street in New York that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Joseph's son Seymour expanded the business to bigger skyscrapers in midtown and downtown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The family's projects now include the Bank of America Tower near Bryant Park, the Conde Nast building in midtown and a partnership in the World Trade Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Yet in 1994, Seymour Durst made his younger son, Douglas, the head of the family business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Robert Durst left the business, but later waged a legal battle against the family to remove the family's trustees for a larger share of the trusts and fortune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>During that time, he reportedly received more than $2 million a year from the family trusts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Read MoreHere's 2014's best collectible investment....</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In 2006, he reached a settlement, with the family agreeing to pay him around $60 million to $65 million, according to report from The New York Times and other media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It's unclear how much of that $60 million has been spent on legal fees and other expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>According to The Real Deal, he has dabbled in real estate investing in recent years, buying a portfolio of rental properties in New York's Cobble Hill and Williamsburg as well as a $1.75 million townhouse in Harlem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While he may not be as rich as his brother or family, Durst has never been hurting for cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>During his trial in Galveston, Texas, in 2003, in which he was acquitted of murdering a neighbor, Durst told jurors, "I've always had more money than I could possibly spend."</td></tr>
