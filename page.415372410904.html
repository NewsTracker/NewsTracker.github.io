<h3>Nemtsov Suspect Tortured, Forced to Confess, Activist Says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Investigators didn't confirm or deny the accusations made by Andrei Babushkin, a member of a Russian human rights commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But they said Babushkin may have broken the law by making the comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Babushkin told The Associated Press that he visited the detention center where main suspect Zaur Dadaev had been held on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Babushkin said there were abrasions on Dadaev's body and that he had been "tortured by those who detained him" and later taken to the Investigative Committee, where "he was forced to confess."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Five people have been detained in connection with Nemtsov's shooting on Feb. 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dadaev was the only one who, according to a judge, confessed to the killing, though in court he didn't admit guilt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The commission that Babushkin belongs to is an unofficial advisory body to the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It operates under the auspices of the Kremlin, but many of its members are respected activists with decades-long careers in human rights work in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement that Babushkin and a journalist accompanying him had been allowed to visit Dadaev's prison cell only to see the conditions under which he was being held, but had broken the law by publicizing details about the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Such actions may be regarded as interference in the investigation," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The committee said that this was "a violation not only of the rules (of visiting rights) but also of the law," and said that both Babushkin and the journalist would be questioned by investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The committee, however, didn't confirm or deny Babushkin's claims that Dadaev had been mistreated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In an interview published with the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets by journalist Eva Merkacheva, Dadaev said that he had been detained for two days with a bag over his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"They shouted at me all the time: 'Have you killed Nemtsov?' I told them, 'No,'" he was quoted as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When investigators told him that a friend who had been detained "would be released if I confessed, I agreed. I thought they would save him, and that I would be brought to Moscow alive."</td></tr>

<h3>'Reinstate Clarkson' Petition Tops 250,000</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clarkson was suspended following an alleged fracas with a producer on his TV motoring show, reportedly over a lack of catering after filming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>More than 600,000 people have now signed an online petition calling for the 54-year-old star to be reinstated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clarkson - who is a friend of David Cameron and lives in his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire - laughed off his latest controversy, telling reporters he was "off to the job centre".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When asked if he planned to resign after reportedly trying to punch 36-year-old producer Oisin Tymon, he replied: "I've been suspended, haven't I?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Asked if his suspension was over a row about food, he said "no, no, no" but said "yes" when asked if he had any regrets about what had happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Cameron commented: "He's a constituent of mine, he's a friend of mine, he's a huge talent. I see that he said he regrets some of what happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Because he is a talent and he does amuse and entertain so many people, including my children who'll be heartbroken if Top Gear is taken off air, I hope this can be sorted out because it is a great programme and he is a great talent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>BBC director-general Tony Hall said an investigation was taking place into the alleged fracas, adding: "The most important thing in anything like this is to gather the facts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He went on: "I am a fan of Jeremy Clarkson but this is a serious thing that is alleged to have taken place."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Speaking about Clarkson, Top Gear co-presenter James May joked: "I've said many times before, the man is a knob but I quite like him. It's all getting a bit ridiculous."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Top Gear host was suspended and the show put on hold after he apparently became involved in a "fracas" at the end of filming in Newcastle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Daily Mirror quoted a source as saying Clarkson "snapped" when he discovered no food had been laid on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He and his fellow presenters and crew are believed to have been staying at Simonstone Hall Hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire, at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The three remaining episodes in the current series, including one that was due to air this Sunday, have been postponed, it is understood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>No one else has been suspended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Clarkson's Top Gear contract runs out at the end of the month, making it easier for the BBC to part company with him should it wish to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The star, who has been involved in a number of high-profile gaffes in recent years, was put on what the corporation called his final warning in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It followed claims he used the n-word while reciting the nursery rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny Moe during filming of the BBC2 programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Over the years, there have been numerous calls for Clarkson to be sacked, including online petitions signed by thousands of people, but all have been ignored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Talking to Sky News, former BBC chairman Michael Grade described him as "the Kevin Pietersen of broadcasting".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Top Gear is one of the BBC's biggest money spinners, pulling in millions of pounds from a devoted - and international - audience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At the end of 2012, the corporation paid Clarkson 14m, which included buying out his 30% stake in Bedder 6, the company that owns the Top Gear brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sunday's episode was due to feature Clarkson with co-hosts Hammond and May getting to grips with classic cars such as a Fiat 124 Spider, an MGB GT and a Peugeot 304 cabriolet.</td></tr>
