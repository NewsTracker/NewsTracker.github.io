<h3>Israel's leading parties tied, exit polls show</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Exit polls by Israel's leading television channels showed that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party drew even with Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union in the election on Tuesday, making the formation of the next government a serious challenge for both candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As polls closed, Israel's Channel 10 and Channel 1 said Likud and the Zionist Union had secured 27 seats each in the 120-member parliament, known as the Knesset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, Channel 2 said Netanyahu had eked out a narrow victory, winning 28 seats to 27 for Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Netanyahu took to twitter to declare "a great victory for Likud" adding the result was a "major victory for the people of Israel".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Final results are not expected until early on Wednesday morning (local time).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A narrow loss for Mr Netanyahu would still put him in a better position than the opposition Zionist Union to cobble together a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A fourth term would put Mr Netanyahu on track to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>No party has ever won an outright majority in Israel's 67-year history - with any number of allegiances possible among the 10 or 11 parties expected to win a place in the parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The party invited to try to form a government would have up to 42 days to negotiate a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It may be mid-May at the earliest before Israel has a new government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After a bitterly contested campaign, the election has turned into a referendum on "Bibi" Netanyahu, 65, who has been in power for a total of nine years spread over three terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Netanyahu took extraordinary steps to drum up support from right-wing voters, reversing policy on the eve of the election with an announcement that he would never allow a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On election day, he accused left-wing groups of trying to remove him from power by busing Arab Israeli voters to polling stations, a statement that drew a sharp rebuke from Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A fourth Netanyahu term would probably also prolong his prickly relationship with Israel's main ally, the United States, at least as long as Barack Obama is in the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Netanyahu has focused on the threat from Iran's nuclear program and militant Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Photo: Isaac Herzog (C), co-leader of the center-left Zionist Union party, casts his ballot at a polling station in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But many Israelis said they were tiring of the message, and the centre-left's campaign on social and economic issues, especially the high cost of housing and everyday living in Israel, appeared to have won support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In a possible sign of edginess, Mr Netanyahu took to Facebook to denounce what he said was an effort by left-wing non-profit groups to get Arab-Israelis out to sway the election against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The right-wing government is in danger," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Arab voters are going to vote in droves. Left-wing NGOs are bringing them in buses."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Facebook comments drew a rebuke from Washington, where the Obama administration is already angry with Mr Netanyahu for delivering a speech to Congress opposing its nuclear talks with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Since there are more parties on the right and far-right, Mr Netanyahu would have the advantage in coalition building if the Zionist Union wins by only a small margin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But if the centre-left wins by four or more seats, it should get the nod first to try to form a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr Herzog, who has overcome criticism of his slight stature and reedy voice to lead a strong campaign, voted in Tel Aviv, where he emphasised the election was about a new direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Whoever wants to continue the way of Bibi - despair and disappointment - can vote for him," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Whoever wants to continue the way of Bibi - despair and disappointment - can vote for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But whoever wants change, hope, and really a better future for Israel, vote for the Zionist Union under my leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Isaac Herzog, Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"But whoever wants change, hope, and really a better future for Israel, vote for the Zionist Union under my leadership."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The son of a former president and the grandson of an eminent rabbi, Herzog, 54, is as close as it gets to having Kennedy-style heritage in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>While his leadership has been criticised in the past, he has shown wit and intellect on the campaign trail, bolstering his image among voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Three or four parties are likely to decide how the balance of power tips in the coalition building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Moshe Kahlon, the leader of Kulanu, a centrist party that broke away from Likud, was widely considered the most important "kingmaker".</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A former communications minister credited with bringing down mobile phone prices, MR Kahlon could ally with either Mr Netanyahu or Mr Herzog, bringing up to 10 seats with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>One of the party's candidates, Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, said whoever won would have to try to repair relations with Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, could also ally with either side, bringing 12-14 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But he did sit comfortably with religious parties, making him less flexible in coalition talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>If the centre-left was to assemble a coalition, it would also need the support of ultra-Orthodox parties, which were expected to win around 13 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Another factor is the parties from Israel's 20 per cent Arab minority, which for the first time united under one list and were expected to win around 13 seats as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>While they are unlikely to join a centre-left coalition, they could give it tacit support and create a block against Mr Netanyahu.</td></tr>
