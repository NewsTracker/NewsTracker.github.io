<tr><td>3</td><td>BEIRUT, May 30 (Reuters) - Islamic State blew up a major prison complex in the central Syrian city of Palmyra on Saturday, according to a group monitoring the war, destroying an important symbol of government control in the jihadist-held city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The prison was empty of people at the time of the detonation, said Rami Abdulrahman from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Islamic State announced the explosion in a statement on social media and supporters posted pictures of huge clouds of grey smoke above the sprawling complex in the city, also known as Tadmur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Syrian state media did not mention the explosion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The prison is not located among the city's ancient ruins, which Syrian officials have warned could be destroyed by the al Qaeda offshoot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Islamic State fighters, who captured the city from government forces earlier this month, are not reported to have harmed its 2,000-year-old monuments and the prison explosion is the first report of major destruction since the takeover.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Detailed information about inmates and conditions inside the high security prison is rare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A 2001 Amnesty International report, based on the accounts of former inmates, described the prison as "designed to inflict the maximum suffering, humiliation and fear on prisoners."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It said Lebanese, Palestinians, Jordanians, and Iraqis were also believed to have been detained in Syrian prisons, including in Palmyra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Former war crimes prosecutors said in January 2014 that a Syrian military police photographer had supplied evidence showing the systematic torture and killing of about 11,000 detainees in Syrian jails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Syrian government said the report was politicized and the images were fake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This picture released on Wednesday, May 20, 2015 on the website of Islamic State militants, shows black columns of smoke rising through the air during a battle between Islamic State militants and the Syrian government forces on a road between Homs and Palmyra, Syria.</td></tr>
