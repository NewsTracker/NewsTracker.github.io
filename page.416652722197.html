<tr><td>3</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - Life was slowly edging back toward normal in Nepal's quake-hit capital Friday as residents packed up tents and moved indoors, farmers delivered fresh produce and lines disappeared at gasoline stations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fresh croissants even emerged from a popular bakery and were quickly snapped up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As rescue workers continued to comb the rubble in Kathmandu for survivors, the government said it was handing out the equivalent of $1,000 to families for each victim killed in Saturday's earthquake, and another $400 for funeral costs, according to state-run Nepal Radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The death toll from the mammoth quake climbed to 6,198, including those who died in an avalanche on Mount Everest, plus more than 60 elsewhere in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The city got a lift Thursday when two survivors, including a 15-year-old boy, were rescued after being buried in debris for five days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Although poorer sections of the city remained strewn with collapsed buildings, there were visibly fewer tents standing in a central part of Kathmandu that had been packed with people in the first few days after the magnitude 7.8 quake hit amid repeated aftershocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Krishna Maharjan, a farmer on the outskirts, brought green onions and cauliflower on his bicycle into the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are trying to get as much fresh food to the people as possible," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I feel it is our small contribution. But that's what we can do and every little bit helps."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More than 130,000 houses are reportedly destroyed, according to the U.N. humanitarian office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Its chief, Valerie Amos, landed in Nepal for a three-day visit to meet victims and local leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She plans to visit areas outside the Kathmandu Valley, according to the deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, Farhan Haq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Inaccessibility to some remote areas, the lack of helicopters, poor communication and security concerns remain the main challenges in delivering relief," Haq said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In the past 48 hours, the U.N. Children's Fund, or UNICEF, has delivered nearly 30 metric tons of supplies, including tents, water purification tablets, and first aid and hygiene kits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A group of Nepal's Gurkhas serving the British army have rushed back home to help their quake-hit countrymen get some clean drinking water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The soldiers from the Queen's Gurkha Engineers Unit on Thursday set up a portable water purification unit on the Kathmandu grounds of the old royal palace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I am just glad I could serve my countrymen when they really needed something so necessary like clean drinking water," said Corporal Bhesh Gurung, 34.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I have been away for 13 years serving in a foreign land and finally I can do something for my motherland."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Gurung and his fellow Gurkha soldiers, helped by some Nepalese soldiers, are pumping ground water, filtering it in a purification unit and storing it in a 5,000-liter tank.</td></tr>
