<h3>Bali Nine executions imminent: lawyer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The lawyer for a Nigerian man scheduled for execution with Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran says the embassy has been summoned to Central Java, a likely sign the date is imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Utomo Karim, lawyer for Raheem Salami, says on Thursday afternoon the Nigerian embassy received a letter asking it to go to Cilacap, the port closest to Nusakambangan, on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Based on experience from the previous execution, they're going to tell them the date for the execution," he told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Indonesia is required to give 72 hours notice of the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are in the same cell block as Salami on Nusakambangan, where they and six other drug offenders await execution by firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Utomo says based on the experience of the Nigerian embassy in January, when six people were executed, the Saturday meeting means the date is drawing near.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Last time, when we were asked to gather in the district prosecutor's office, we were then taken to Nusakambangan to tell the convict about the execution time," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"And three days after that, they were executed. I don't know whether other embassies have been notified at the same."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Attorney-General's spokesman Tony Spontana confirmed reports his office has sent letters to prosecutors advising them to prepare for the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Asked if a date was set he replied: "up to tonight, not yet".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The letters asked prosecutors to make preparations, and were not the notification letters for the convicts themselves, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran have lodged a new appeal in the constitutional court but the attorney-general says the Bali Nine pair have exhausted their legal avenues and he won't recognise the latest action.</td></tr>
