<tr><td>3</td><td>WELLNGTON, New Zealand (AP) - Winds from an extremely powerful cyclone that blew through the Pacific's Vanuatu archipelago were beginning to subside Saturday, revealing widespread destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Communication systems in many of the hard-hit outer islands remained down, meaning it could take some time before the full extent of the damage caused by Cyclone Pam is known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer who is in Port Vila, said the capital's streets were littered with roofs blown from homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She said she's hearing reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She said there is no power or running water in the capital and that communication remains unreliable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's still really quite dangerous outside. Most people are still hunkering down," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The damage is quite extensive in Port Vila but there are so many more vulnerable islands. I can't even imagine what it's like in those vulnerable communities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact and scope of the disaster wasn't yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>The U.N. said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>"I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Morrison said the winds seemed to peak between midnight and 1 a.m. Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said she was in a fully boarded-up cyclone-proof house but still spent a frightening night as a tree and a tin roof from a nearby home hit her house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A westward change of course put populated areas directly in the path of Cyclone Pam's 270 kilometer (168 mile) -per-hour winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were unconfirmed reports of deaths in Vanuatu's northeastern islands after Cyclone Pam moved off its expected track.</td></tr>
