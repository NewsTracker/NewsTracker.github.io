<h3>Egypt stock market falls to lowest level in almost 2 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt's stock market fell to its lowest level in almost two years on Sunday, as global markets sag and investors sober up from a buying binge surrounding a much-hyped economic conference last spring, analysts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The main EGX 30 stock index kicked off the trading week by closing at 6784.09, its lowest level since December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 5.43-percent drop came after a steady fall last week, and as other Middle Eastern markets also tumbled, and it follows an overall global slowdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dubai's stock market closed nearly seven percent lower after a further slide in oil prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's a global sell-off; there's lack of foreign investments, given the macro-economic headwinds," said Amr Elalfy, global head of research at Mubasher Financial Services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"But there were also great hopes and expectations surrounding the economic development conference last March, but people are realizing now that most of them have not yet materialized and that these reforms take time."</td></tr>
