<h3>Greece news live: Tsipras quells rebellion as Greeks set to pass tougher three-year rescue package</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>&#x2022; The meeting of the 19 finance ministers of the eurozone is underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It started at 10am BST and will continue for most of the afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>&#x2022; At 3pm BST, the heads of the eurozone will arrive - so Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor and Francois Hollande, France's president, will meet Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>&#x2022; Leaders will "take stock of the situation and set out the political guidelines for the next steps", according to a press release sent out this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"President Donald Tusk confirmed that the euro area authorities were ready to do all that is necessary to ensure financial stability in the euro area," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Next to arrive is Pierre Moscovici.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He says he is still hopeful that a deal can be reached, but sugggests the ball remains in Greece's court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece needs to commit to reforms, he tells reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has also just arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>No words from her this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One of the most vocal opponents of a new Greek bail-out is Slovakia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Its finance minister Peter Ka&#x17e;imir has been speaking to reporters this morning - reluctantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I cannot speak to media because I'm Catholic and I don't work on Sundays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nothing. It's not possible to reach a deal today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, has just arrived in the back of a grey Mercedes Benz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He didn't stop to talk to reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sajid Javid, the UK business secretary, has been speaking to Andrew Marr about Greece this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It certainly sounds like they don't have a deal yet, that's certainly clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It's also a reminder of just how difficult it's been for the Greek people for a number of years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>For any country to go through a decline of GDP of 25pc , the Greek people are really suffering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>We want to see a resolution to the solution to this as soon as possible, but clearly it's got to be something that comes from within the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>I hope they can reach a deal as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>I've always said the euro was a flawed proposal right from the start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It was always gonig to lead to these types of problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I think it was entirely predictable, and countries that are in the eurozone - they have to draw lessons and realise if they want to have a single currency, have to have a single country to go with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Finland, which has always been uneasy about Greece's bail-out, insisted this morning that "no-one is blocking a deal".</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mr Stubb said: "We are all constructively terying to find a solution in a very difficult situation. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>We are very far away from the conditionality that we need.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>If this was a negotiation from one to 10, I think we&#x2019;re still standing somewhere between 3 and 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>So making progress but not there yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>There are basically three litmus tests here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Number one is the stability of the euro zone and Greek finances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Number two is debt sustainability and then number three is basic financing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>No one is blocking a deal, we&#x2019;re all constructively trying to find a solution in a very difficult situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The conditionality that has been presented by the Greeks is simply not enough at this stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>We need to have clear commitments, clear conditionality and clear proof that those conditions will be implemented at the end of the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>You can read all about events yesterday here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Eurozone finance ministers have already started to arrive for day two of crunch talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Hans Jorg Schelling, Austria's finance minister, says there are still "many differences" between the Eurogroup and Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Alexander Stubb, his Finnish counterpart, also told reporters this morning that the 19 nation bloc was still "very far away" from reaching a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the Greek debt crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Today was meant to be the day when the crisis was either solved or Europe prepared for a Grexit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Just days after Donald Tusk, the president of the European Union, said "loud and clear that the final deadline ends this week", he's just announced that a summit of the 28 leaders of the European Union - including UK prime minister David Cameron has been cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Greece: what does the 'No' vote mean?</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>How big is Greece's debt?</td></tr>
