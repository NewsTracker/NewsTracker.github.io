<h3>Egypt executes man for throwing 2 to their deaths from roof</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Interior Ministry, which is in charge of police, said in a statement that Mahmoud Ramadan was behind the deaths of a young man and a child who were thrown off a rooftop in Alexandria, during large protests demanding Mohammed Morsi's reinstatement after the military removed him from power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The famous murderer of children thrown from a rooftop during the violence, intimidation and thuggery carried out by supporters of the former president ... was executed this morning," chief prosecutor Hisham Barakat said later in a separate statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said Ramadan and others convicted of crimes that day used weapons including firearms to sow panic and were responsible for the violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rights group Amnesty International said that the execution came after an unfair trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"According the defense team the primary lawyer (in the case) was arrested ahead of the trial and released after it finished," said Amnesty's Egypt researcher Mohamed Elmessiry, adding that the trial did not address police unwillingness to stop the day's violence, investigate the killing of Morsi supporters killed the same day, and that it used video evidence that did not reflect the whole picture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Another man was also sentenced to death for the killings, which happened two days after Morsi's July 3, 2013 overthrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Footage repeatedly aired on national television showed one of the men roaming the roof raising a black flag often used by Islamic militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At least 16 others were also killed in Alexandria that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of those killed was a child, who witnesses including an Associated Press journalist said was stabbed and then thrown off the roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A young man was hurled to his death and Morsi supporters were seen beating his lifeless body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The violence set the tone for months to come.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Authorities launched a harsh crackdown on Morsi supporters and banned his Muslim Brotherhood group, killing hundreds of protesters and flooding jails with tens of thousands of detainees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The move largely stamped out dissent, although small scale attacks and bombings still take place regularly in Cairo and other cities and a militant insurgency continues in the restive northern part of the Sinai Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Interior Ministry Spokesman Maj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Gen. Hany Abdel-Latif said Ramadan's execution was the first involving Morsi supporters implicated in violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Also Saturday, a bomb exploded in front of an Emirati bank branch north of the capital, killing a policeman and a civilian and wounding 16, the latest of several attacks by suspected militants seeking to destabilize the government over the last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Security and health officials from Gharbiya province said the bomb went off overnight in Mahalla, 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Cairo, near a local Emirates NBD branch.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>The other victims were still receiving treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to brief reporters, said the policeman was passing by coincidence and that two bank employees were among the wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The bank, Dubai's largest, declined to comment and did not make executives available to discuss the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>United Arab Emirates is one of several Gulf countries that have sent billions of dollars in aid to back Egypt's current government, led by ex-army chief President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the overthrow of Morsi.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td>French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius delivers remarks during a news conference with Secretary of State John Kerry, on Saturday, March 7, 2015, in Paris.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Secretary of State John Kerry speaks to the medi during a news conference with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, on Saturday, March 7, 2015, in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>PARIS (AP) - U.S. and European diplomats said Saturday they are united in their strategy and goal in trying to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are on the same page," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said after talks with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We know what we are chasing after and we are chasing after the same thing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kerry and Fabius, who met with the British and German foreign ministers after their session, cited progress in the talks, with the last round just wrapping up Wednesday in Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But they also acknowledged big gaps that must be bridged if the sides are to reach a deal by the end of March deadline set by negotiators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There is progress in certain areas but there are also divergences," Fabius said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said more work needed to be done on the length of the proposed agreement and on how to verify Iranian compliance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Added Kerry: "We have exactly the same assessments. We have made progress but there are gaps. We need to close those gaps."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Their comments appeared to be at odds with those of a senior Iranian official said some roadblocks hindering an agreement had been cleared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Iran's vice president, Ali Akbar Salehi, said technical impediments in the way of a final nuclear accord had been eliminated during the ongoing discussions with American negotiators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Salehi, who is also in charge of Iran's nuclear agency, told Iranian state television on Saturday that Tehran offered proposals to remove "fake concerns" over the country's nuclear program, paving the way for a final deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The next round of nuclear talks is set to begin March 15, involving mainly U.S. and Iranian representatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A small European delegation also will participate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That configuration has led to some complaints that the talks involving the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Germany and Iran have become more of an American-Iranian project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Objections, notably from France over certain provisions, held up agreement on an interim deal with Iran in November 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kerry denied such suggestions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He noted that he and Fabius would join German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier and British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond as well as the European Union's foreign policy chief, Frederica Mogherini, for more detailed discussions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"This is not a bilateral negotiation ... and all of our partners are consistently sharing information, sharing ideas," Kerry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Steinmeier said after the meeting that he was hopeful of having "a possible deal wrapped up by the middle of the year at the latest."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We negotiate knowing full well that our responsibility is also to negotiate for others and that means only a lasting and resistant deal," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Kerry stressed that Iran still needs to make decisions to prove to the world it is not trying to develop nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tehran claims its nuclear program is peaceful and exists only to produce energy for civilian use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We have a critical couple of weeks ahead of us," Kerry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"But we are not feeling a sense of urgency that we have to get any deal. We have to get the right deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In an address to the U.S. Congress last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned against making a deal that could leave Iran on the path toward nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I would rather have no deal than a bad deal," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Associated Press writers Elaine Ganley in Paris and Ali Akbar Dareni in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.</td></tr>
