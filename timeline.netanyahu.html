<li>White House spokesman Josh Earnest reaffirmed President Barack Obama's focus on a two-state solution and said that based on Netanyahu's comments, the United States "will evaluate our approach to this situation moving forward".</li>
<li>The question is whether Netanyahu - who shifted sharply to the right in the last days of his campaign, using messages such as the 'no-state' pledge to successfully draw right-wing votes away from ultranationalist parties - really meant what he said.</li>
<li>Netanyahu later qualified his pre-election statement in an interview with the U.S. television network, MSNBC, on Thursday, saying he still seeks a two-state solution but the time may not be right for one just now.</li>
<li>There is no active discussion along those lines, or of a two-state solution, because the last peace talks broke down last April and Netanyahu has said repeatedly that he does not see Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has struck a unity deal with the Islamist group Hamas, as a partner for peace.</li>
<li>But a U.S. official said it was possible the Obama administration would now allow a Security Council resolution on a two-state solution to proceed by withholding its veto, a move that would alarm Netanyahu's government.</li>
<li>For the Palestinians, Netanyahu's intransigence - and his honest acknowledgement that he doesn't want a Palestinian state - may end up bolstering their cause while further isolating Israel internationally, particularly among its chief trading partners, the European Union and United States.</li>

<li>Netanyahu row casts doubt on Obama pledge to 'have Israel's back'</li>
<li>As internal discussions proceeded on Friday, the White House appeared in no rush to lower the temperature in the worst U.S.-Israeli crisis in decades, sparked by Netanyahu's campaign declaration that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch.</li>
<li>The White House made clear for a second straight day that it had little faith in Netanyahu's effort to backtrack since winning Tuesday's election and insist he was in favor of a two-state solution, long a cornerstone of U.S. Middle East policy.</li>
<li>There was no sign of any imminent move to turn the administration's heated rhetoric against Netanyahu into a tangible shift in policy.</li>
<li>As a result, some analysts questioned whether Washington was merely posturing to put the Israeli leader on the defensive at a time when an end-of-March deadline looms in U.S.-led nuclear diplomacy with Iran that Netanyahu vehemently opposes.</li>
<li>"The administration is putting everything on the table except security assistance - and this will allow Netanyahu time to walk back his comments more credibly," said Daniel Kurtzer, former U.S. ambassador to Israel.</li>
<li>White House officials have left little doubt that Netanyahu's U.S. ambassador, Ron Dermer, has been largely frozen out by parts of the administration for his role in orchestrating Netanyahu's speech to Congress this month against Obama's Iran diplomacy.</li>
