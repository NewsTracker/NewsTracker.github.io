<li>The Palestinian news agency WAFA says Abbas told Netanyahu it is important to reach a peace deal next year.</li>

<li>Hammond said he understood Netanyahu's concerns, but added "We have always been clear that this deal was about the nuclear file."</li>
<li>Getting in the last word, Netanyahu also spelled out his opposition to the gradual lifting of sanctions against Iran, which he told Hammond would allow Iran to foment "more terrorism, more aggression," in the Middle East and beyond.</li>
