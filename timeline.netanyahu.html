<li>Obama, Netanyahu make dueling appeals on Iran to US Jews</li>
<li>"The nuclear deal with Iran doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb. It actually paves Iran's path to the bomb," Netanyahu said in his remarks.</li>
<li>Netanyahu, one of the fiercest critics of the nuclear accord, also disputed Obama's assertion that opponents of the diplomatic deal favor war.</li>

<li>Carter on Tuesday did avoid a public tongue-lashing by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</li>
<li>A Carter aide who attended the talks in Jerusalem later told reporters that Netanyahu bluntly expressed his opposition to the Iran deal but did not get angry or upset with Carter.</li>
<li>The U.S. official said neither Carter nor Netanyahu raised the issue of potential U.S. compensation to Israel in the form of increased defense assistance to counter Iran-related threats.</li>
<li>He was the first Cabinet-level U.S. official to meet with Netanyahu since the signing of the Iran deal.</li>
<li>They shook hands and Netanyahu quickly steered Carter upstairs, to Carter's apparent surprise that Netanyahu was bypassing a chance to publicly attack the deal.</li>

<li>While the investigation shows no sign of threatening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hold on power, it nonetheless gave him a new headache at a time of growing international isolation and domestic turmoil with a narrow and fractured coalition.</li>
<li>Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, have for years faced scrutiny over their spending and have fended off accusations that their lifestyles are out of touch with regular Israelis.</li>
<li>The Justice Ministry declined to comment on what or who exactly would be investigated, but Israeli media said those charges, as well as another involving unusually high payments for Netanyahu's longtime electrician, would be at the centre of the probe.</li>
<li>Netanyahu has faced a bumpy few months since being re-elected for a fourth term in March.</li>
<li>Under Netanyahu, Israel also has faced broadening international isolation.</li>
<li>Perhaps the biggest blow to Netanyahu was the signing last week of the international deal meant to curb Iran's nuclear program, which he had battled relentlessly and unsuccessfully to thwart.</li>

<li>Hammond said he understood Netanyahu's concerns, but added "We have always been clear that this deal was about the nuclear file."</li>
