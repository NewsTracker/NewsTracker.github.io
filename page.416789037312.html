<h3>Israel's Netanyahu reportedly close to forming coalition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Wednesday, April 22, 2015 file photo, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaves the podium after speaking during a Memorial Day ceremony to commemorate the country's fallen soldiers at Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With a little over 24 hours to go, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scrambling to get his governing coalition together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu has had a tough time striking deals with potential partners to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If he fails by midnight Wednesday then President Reuven Rivlin will task someone else with the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>With the clock ticking toward a midnight deadline, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday inched closer toward a deal to form a new government as he rushed to work out the details of an emerging agreement with his final coalition partner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A last-minute deal with the hawkish Jewish Home Party was necessary to prevent an almost-unimaginable scenario by which Netanyahu would be forced out of office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With Jewish Home, Netanyahu would secure a narrow 61-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If he fails by the end of the day, President Reuven Rivlin must appoint someone else to form a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Israeli TV stations said Netanyahu's Likud and the Jewish Home were closing in on a deal that would give the Jewish Home control of the influential Justice Ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One person familiar with the talks said the sides were finalizing the details of the agreement, since Netanyahu is seeking to retain control over some of the ministry's responsibilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing secret negotiations, said a deal was expected before the midnight deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After Netanyahu's Likud Party won March 17 elections with 30 seats, it seemed he would have a relatively easy time forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But talks stalled this week when Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman unexpectedly stepped down and announced his secular nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party was joining the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That left Netanyahu dependent on Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett, a former aide who has a rocky relationship with Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Netanyahu has secured deals with three partners controlling 53 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They include Kulanu, a centrist party focused on economic issues, and two ultra-Orthodox religious parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Fuming over the deals giving ultra-Orthodox parties ministerial power over religious services, Bennett was driving a hard bargain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Slated to serve as education minister, Bennett also demanded the job of justice minister for a senior party member, Ayelet Shaked, who is an outspoken critic of the country's judiciary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Jewish Home party is linked to the West Bank settler movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Despite its anger toward Netanyahu, it was unlikely to push for his ouster, a move that could open a potential path to government of the more dovish Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But even if they reach a deal, Netanyahu would have a thin majority, leaving him vulnerable to the demands of any individual coalition lawmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A narrow coalition would have a difficult time passing economic reforms favored by Kulanu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It also would be averse to Palestinian peace moves and likely favor expanded settlement construction, putting it on a collision course with the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Likud officials concede such a government would not be effective or last long, raising speculation that Netanyahu will ultimately reach out to the Zionist Union and its leader, Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He insists on serving as the opposition leader.</td></tr>
