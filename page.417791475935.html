<tr><td>13</td><td>Chad also is a close ally of France in its counter-terrorism Operation Barkhane in five countries in the Sahel region and the French army has set up its headquarters for the campaign in N'Djamena.</td></tr>

<tr><td>21</td><td>"It's an international problem now," he said.</td></tr>
