<h3>Boston Marathon bomber files for new trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lawyers for Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have applied for a new trial, saying it is "required in the interests of justice".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has filed a motion for a new trial, less than two weeks after he was formally sentenced to death for the 2013 attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers filed a preliminary motion for a new trial on Monday for his conviction and death sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The motion did not contain any details on what grounds they plan to argue, saying only that a new trial is "required in the interests of justice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 21-year-old Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 charges in the bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The same jury recommended the death penalty, and a federal judge on June 24 sentenced him to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers call the motion a "placeholder" until they can file a more detailed motion next month.</td></tr>
