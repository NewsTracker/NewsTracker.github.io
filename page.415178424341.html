<h3>Snipers and booby traps slow Iraq forces from retaking Tikrit from Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baghdad: Iraqi forces have closed in on Tikrit, their progress slowed by jihadist snipers and booby traps, on the second day of Baghdad's largest operation yet against the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The government has mobilised a 30,000-strong force for the push to retake Tikrit made up of Shiite militiamen and Sunni tribesmen as well as troops and police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Iraqi forces reload.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Outnumbered and outgunned, the jihadists who have held Tikrit since June 2014 have been resorting to guerrilla tactics to disrupt the government's three-pronged advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They are using urban warfare and snipers, so we are advancing in a cautious and delicate way, and we need more time," a lieutenant general on the ground said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Iraqi forces are moving on Tikrit from three directions, with units targeting the towns of Al-Alam and Ad-Dawr to the north and south, while another large contingent drives on the city from the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Smoke rises from an explosion as Iraqi forces, Shiite militiamen and Sunni tribal fighters battle Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We are close to Ad-Dawr, but Daesh is still in the centre," the senior officer said, using an Arabic acronym for IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, who has helped coordinate Baghdad's counter-attacks against Islamic State since it seized much of northern Iraq in June, was overseeing at least part of the operation, witnesses told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His presence on the frontline highlights neighbouring Iran's influence over the Shi'ite fighters who have been key to containing the militants in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In contrast the US-led air coalition which has been attacking Islamic State across Iraq and Syria has not yet played a role in Tikrit, the Pentagon said, perhaps in part because of the high-level Iranian presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The recapture of Tikrit is of both strategic and symbolic importance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Located about 160 kilometres north of Baghdad, it is the hometown of former president Saddam Hussein, the remnants of whose Baath party have collaborated with IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Military commanders have said Tikrit is a stepping stone for an even more ambitious operation aimed at retaking Mosul, the large northern city which has been the main Iraq hub of IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Analysts said the battle for Tikrit, which the government has already attempted and failed to retake several times, would be a test of how effectively such diverse fighting units work together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The battle for Tikrit and other towns in Salaheddin province will provide a mini-preview of what awaits further to the north in Mosul," the Soufan Group intelligence consultancy said in a brief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tikrit and its surroundings are Sunni and some local tribes have been accused of involvement in the massacre of hundreds of new, mostly Shiite, recruits at a nearby base called Speicher in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Some leaders, including the powerful head of Iraq's Popular Mobilisation units Hadi al-Ameri, have explicitly said the Tikrit operation would be an opportunity to exact revenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A senior US defence official had suggested last month that the Mosul offensive should begin in April or May, a move that irked Iraqi commanders who argued the timing was theirs to decide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Monday, US President Barack Obama's envoy for the fight against IS stressed there was no timeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The point about Mosul, or the point about any aspect of the counter-offensive, is less about the timing than about the preparation," John Allen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Australia announced on Tuesday it will send another 300 troops to Iraq in a joint mission with New Zealand to help prepare Iraqi forces for the fightback.</td></tr>
