<h3>Greece 'seeking a new loan' from the IMF in step closer to bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos wrote Greece was "seeking a new loan" from the IMF in a letter to managing director Christine Lagarde.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Debt-crippled Greece took a step closer to a huge third international bailout by formally requesting IMF help, but sources said "logistical problems" were delaying the start of talks in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Greek government, which is seeking a three-year bailout worth up to 86 billion euros ($129 billion) to avert financial meltdown and a chaotic exit from the eurozone, had initially planned to go without fresh help from the IMF as it considered the agency too wedded to draconian austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But in a letter to IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos wrote Greece was "seeking a new loan" from the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He noted Greek parliament had passed two laws enshrining a series of tough reforms demanded by the creditors, including tax rises and a pensions overhaul, in a step closer to finalising the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The Greek authorities have committed to implement a number of policies that would enhance fiscal sustainability, strengthen fiscal stability, sustain long-term growth and, importantly, spread the cost of economic adjustment in a fair way," Mr Tsakalotos wrote in the letter, dated July 23 and released to the public on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Tsipras is greeted by boos and cheers at the European parliament, says Greece will submit "credible" reform plans and wants to prevent a "divided Europe".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It is our belief that it will take several quarters before the Greek economy faces up to these challenges and returns to a vigorous and sustainable path to growth with fairness and social inclusion," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Tsakalotos confirmed Greece, which has been bailed out by the European Union, European Central Bank and IMF twice since 2010, had already formally requested a new three-year loan from the eurozone's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Greece's existing aid program from the IMF runs until early 2016, and the letter appears to have been a gesture of goodwill as a new request is not technically necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The request came amid an apparent delay in getting the ball rolling on talks to finalise the package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Negotiators from the creditors, known collectively as the troika, have not set foot in Athens for more than a year as hostility has grown between the two sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Thursday, Greece said negotiators would fly in to Athens to begin the talks on Friday, but this swiftly became "in the coming days", according to a European Commission spokeswoman, with the location of the talks and offices for the creditors apparently among the sticking points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The mission is being prepared. We are still discussing a location as we have to find an accessible place to work, near the ministries," a source close to the negotiations said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The two sides are under enormous pressure to hammer out the rescue deal before August 20, when Athens is scheduled to make a loan repayment of 3.2 billion euros to the ECB that it cannot currently afford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The IMF warned finalising the deal, which is conditioned on Greece implementing painful reforms, would not be easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Fund took part in the two previous bailouts but has said it will only participate this time around if European creditors reduce Athens' debt burden to a level it considers "sustainable".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The key points of the agreement between Greece and its eurozone partners that includes punishing austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Clearly it's a difficult path ahead, we're just at the beginning of the process," IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the early hours of Thursday, Greek parliament passed further reforms demanded by creditors for the talks to begin, including changes to the justice system, a bank deposit protection scheme and measures to shore up the liquidity of Greece's banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The bill passed by a resounding 230 votes out of the 298 members of parliament present, after a five-hour debate that once again exposed deep divisions in the governing Syriza party over whether to accept more austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While the result is a victory for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in that he managed to convince parliament to back him on the bailout, he did suffer a major rebellion from Syriza MPs for the second time in a week - prompting analysts to predict he may be forced to call early elections.</td></tr>
