<tr><td>43</td><td>Despite the bleak forecasts, some Greeks appeared to take the latest turmoil in stride, saying the measures Greece will have to pass are harsh but that the alternative would have been worse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"We aren't in a good position within the European Union under the current measures and under this present situation," said Kostas Plafoutzis, an Athens merchant.</td></tr>
