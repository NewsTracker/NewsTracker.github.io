<h3>Boko Haram gears up for battle in Nigeria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Boko Haram fighters are massing at their headquarters in the northeast Nigerian town of Gwoza in preparation for a showdown with multinational forces, residents and an intelligence officer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A woman trapped there since Gwoza was seized in July told her daughter that Islamic extremists are urging civilians to leave town to avoid being killed in crossfire in an anticipated major battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hajiya Adama said her mother said the fighters also have released young women being held against their will, including some made pregnant during their captivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She said her mother left last week and escaped to the town of Yola, in neighbouring Adamawa state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"She told me that Boko Haram terrorists asked them to leave suddenly, that they were preparing grounds for a major battle," Adama told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"She said while being helped by other women to leave through Madagali, they saw many Boko Haram terrorists in trucks and some on bikes moving toward Gwoza."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An intelligence officer said security forces are moving slowly for fear of harming civilians, and especially since Boko Haram is surrounding Gwoza with land mines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Boko Haram in August declared an Islamic caliphate across a swath of northeast Nigeria where it held sway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In recent weeks, Chadian and Nigerian troops have retaken a score of towns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the militants continue to kill scores in suicide bombings and village attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Retaking Gwoza would be a major coup for Nigeria and for the campaign of President Goodluck Jonathan for re-election at critical March 28 ballots.</td></tr>
