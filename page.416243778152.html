<tr><td>6</td><td>(AP) - A jury was seated Tuesday in the death penalty trial of Colorado theater shooter James Holmes after a selection process that experts say was among the largest and most complicated in U.S. history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and injuring 70 others in the July 2012 attack in suburban Denver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His attorneys don't dispute that he pulled the trigger but say he was in the grips of a psychotic episode when he slipped into the packed movie theater and opened fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jurors will decide whether he was legally insane at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If they find him guilty, they must also decide whether he should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison without parole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 12 jurors and 12 alternates were chosen in a process that began Jan. 20 after court officials summoned an unprecedented 9,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There are 19 women and five men, all of whom will sit through the entire trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The group of 24 people and the public will not know who is a primary juror and who is an alternate until they begin deliberations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Among those chosen are a union plumber; a woman who cares for her elderly parents; a woman who once worked at a detox center; and a woman with depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Also on the jury are a Denver Public Schools employee, a teacher and a man who was a survivor of the 1999 Columbine High School shootings who said he could be fair despite having been childhood friends with the shooters and the prom date of a victim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>One juror said during the questioning process that she was nervous about what her community would think of her verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The case is "big and serious, and it's going to have a huge impact on me and everyone else, the defendant and people in the community," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Attorneys on Tuesday questioned 93 remaining jury candidates about their interpretations of the law, how they would gauge witnesses and experts' credibility, and whether they could handle serving on such a high-profile trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>District Attorney George Brauchler characterized it as a "four- to five-month roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He asked prospective jurors if they could serve even if they hear no evidence of a motive, since prosecutors are required to prove only the 165 charges against Holmes - not why they believe he committed the crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Holmes' attorney, Tamara Brady, focused on perceptions of Holmes and whether the jury candidates could be objective given the litany of charges against him and the public scrutiny they will face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She asked how they felt listening for nearly two hours as Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. read a list of the charges, including each victim's name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She wondered if prospective jurors would be too sympathetic to survivors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She said she was nervous "about whether Mr. Holmes can get a fair trial in this case or whether it's just too big."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Potential jurors told attorneys they worry about what their neighbors might think if they reach an unpopular verdict and whether reporters would harass their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>One man said he was reassured when the judge told him steps were taken to shield his identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Many pledged they would not let their decision-making be influenced by concern about what others think.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Other candidates expressed trepidation about hearing graphic testimony and perhaps being overwhelmed by emotion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Some prospective jurors have asked the judge why it has taken nearly three years for the case to come to trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Samour has said it's not an unusual amount of time for a trial this complex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The death penalty and insanity plea introduced complicated and time-consuming legal requirements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In the amount of time it has taken to pick a jury in Denver, federal jurors in Boston convicted marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
