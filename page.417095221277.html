<tr><td>5</td><td>The capture of the two wounded men, one of whom is shown confessing in a video posted by a Ukrainian lawmaker, has delivered fresh proof to the embattled government in Kiev that Russian forces are providing arms and backing to the separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The interception of the Russians coincided with reinvigorated U.S.-Russian diplomacy after Secretary of State John Kerry's meeting last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.</td></tr>
