<h3>EU agency noted 'non-conformity? with Germany's air safety rules before Germanwings crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The concerns over "non-conformity" were said to be especially on air crew health monitoring, a spokesman for The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reportedly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Confirming earlier reports, EASA spokesman Dominique Fouda continued: "On the basis of the EASA recommendations the European commission launched, in late 2014, a process calling for accountability from Germany."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The comments came after 150 people were killed when Germanwings flight 4U9525 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf crashed into the French Alps last month - in the worst of such disaster on French soil in decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The aircraft's co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, is suspected of deliberately accelerating the plane into the mountainside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Reports suggest that the 27-year-old was diagnosed with depression some years ago while training to become a pilot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Germanwings said last week it was unaware Lubitz had suffered depression while training, despite parent company Lufthansa having records of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Responding to recent reports, Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr called Lubitz "100 per cent airworthy" and said the airline were unaware of any health issues that could have compromised his fitness to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meanwhile, German prosecutors said that the co-pilot had researched online for information about suicide and cockpit doors just 24 hours before the devastating Germanwings crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Medical records showed that Lubitz was also taking medicines for depression, anxiety disorders and panic attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The co-pilot is alleged to have lied to doctors telling them he was on sick leave rather than flying commercial planes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He had also sought medical help to try to cure an eye condition, according to German newspaper Bild.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Although Lubitz had informed doctors of his job as a pilot, and in some cases about his employer Germanwings, he deliberately concealed that he was still working.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>According to Saturday's edition of the Wall Street Journal, "EU officials said Germany's air-safety regulator suffered from chronic staffing shortfalls that could undermine its ability to run checks of carriers and crew, including medical checks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An EU commission spokesman said that, based on the EASA findings, it had "told Germany to get its aviation industry in conformity" with the rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Germany's responses are currently being evaluated," he said - adding that it is "part of a continuous system of supervision".</td></tr>
