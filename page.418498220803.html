<h3>MH17 The Sunflowers: Quinn Schansman's father learning to accept 'the unacceptable'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The whole appalling drama of the MH17 tragedy plays in the heart and mind of 55-year-old Thomas Schansman as much as it does on his doorstep in the small Dutch city of Hilversum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Schansman lost his 18-year-old son, Quinn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But living in Hilversum, which saw three entire families wiped out in the air crash, his family also were participants in the ceremonial repatriation of the remains of all 298 victims of the crash, just as they were helpless bystanders to the painstaking process of DNA identification of their remains at a local military facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>MH17 victim Quinn Schansman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>City officials have decided to deck Hilversum in sunflowers for the July 17th first anniversary of the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mayor Pieter Broertjes has decreed that all traffic roundabouts be planted with sunflowers - a low-growing Dutch variety that will not constitute a traffic hazard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But five special sunflower plants, one for each local family affected, are to be featured outside the town hall; the railway station; a church, which was the venue for a memorial service; and the military facility where victims are being identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They have been grown from seeds collected at the MH17 crash site by Fairfax Media, a quantity of which were relayed to the mayor by Thomas Schansman - who also presented the mayor with a one-centimetre seedling grown from one of the Ukrainian seeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Explaining that the Ukraine-sourced seeds would also be distributed to sports clubs and schools attended by local victims, Mr Broertjes told a local newspaper: "This creates a powerful and subtle symbol of our sorrow over the disaster and our unwavering support for the relatives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In Quinn, Schansman describes a son of whom any father would be proud - and reveals himself as the father any son would be proud to have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"At 18 he was beginning to see that he needed to be more responsible. He was strong and athletic; proud of his six-pack and that he was stronger than me. He was getting serious with his girl and doing well in English studies at the International School of Business," Schansman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He had started asking for guidance. At a family gathering for my birthday in June 2014, he said that he wanted to be the youngest CEO ever," Schansman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"He was looking ahead, to doing his master's degree and maybe completing his studies in the US."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Unlike many of the families and friends of the Australian victims, Schansman spoke openly and easily on the toll that grief takes on family life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The year since the crash has gone so fast," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's in the news all the time. We had to try to get back on our feet - when I asked our 11-year-old Xander to go back to school in August or September last year, I argued that it was as Quinn would have expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"But I was telling him what I needed to hear - I had to get back to work; my wife Katinka too. Then I have to deal with papers from Malaysia and go through catalogues of personal belongings to identify what might be Quinn's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's all so painful. It was his birthday in November - but Quinn wasn't here. Same at Christmas and New Year | all these are first times that Quinn was not here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We have to cope in accepting the unacceptable. Life prepares you for the inevitable death of your parents - but losing an 18-year-old child as he is falling in love and planning his future is something I can't understand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On the good days, he takes comfort from seeing his 11-year-old son wearing Quinn's oversized T-shirts; on a bad day, he's grateful that he has an understanding employer who allows him to fade out when he needs to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Sometimes I'm awake at 5am, crying and staring at photos of Quinn. It's all a part of mourning and I don't know how to do it - I have to help the other children and be strong for my partner and be available for my work."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In the midst of such pain, Schansman clings to the sunflower project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It keeps getting bigger and bigger and more and more people become involved," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The mayor is taking such good care of all the plants, which now are 60 to 70 centimetres tall. It will be up to the kids in the schools and sports clubs to keep the plants alive to keep alive the memory of the dead."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He has shared the Ukrainian seeds provided to him by Fairfax Media with eight members of his extended family, hoping that the attention of eight gardeners will produce a good quantity of seed to grow even more plants next summer.</td></tr>
