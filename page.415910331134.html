<h3>Kansas freshman Kelly Oubre Jr headed for NBA draft (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kansas plays New Mexico State on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LAWRENCE, Kan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) -- Kansas swingman Kelly Oubre Jr. announced Wednesday he is leaving for the NBA draft, skipping his final three seasons of eligibility after an up-and-down freshman year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Oubre revealed his intentions in a statement released by the school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It's always been a dream to play in the NBA,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 6-foot-7 Oubre started 27 games this past season, helping the Jayhawks win their 11th straight Big 12 title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He averaged 9.3 points and five rebounds, and showcased his potential when he poured in 25 points in a victory over TCU in the Big 12 Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His decision to leave for the NBA is based more on potential than productivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He scored three points on 1-for-3 shooting in a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 title game, then had just nine points in in a loss to Wichita State in the round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But with impressive athleticism, stifling defense and a deft outside touch, Oubre left a strong impression with NBA scouts who came through Lawrence last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''This should come as really no surprise to anybody that has followed us,'' Kansas coach Bill Self said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Kelly came in being well thought of by NBA personnel and certainly, nothing has changed in that regard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Oubre, who is expected to be among the first 20 players chosen in the June draft, said he spoke with several former Kansas players before making his decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Among them was Joel Embiid, who was chosen third overall last year - two spots behind Jayhawks teammate Andrew Wiggins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''JoJo said he knows what I am going through and he told me his process and some of the things he went through,'' Oubre said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Oubre is the first player to announce he is leaving Kansas, but he may not be the last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Fellow freshman Cliff Alexander's future remains in question after he was forced to miss the final few weeks of the season due to an investigation into improper benefits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Leading scorer Perry Ellis could also opt to skip his senior season, though few mock drafts have him rated highly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kansas has already signed five-star power forward Carlton Bragg, and Self has met with 7-foot center Mike Thorn Jr., who is transferring from Charlotte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Jayhawks are also deeply invested in Jaylen Brown and Malik Newman, two of the top uncommitted recruits in the country.</td></tr>
