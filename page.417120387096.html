<h3>Tweets Fly Back into Google Search Results After Four Years of Exile</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It&#x2019;s been a long time coming, but tweets are finally viewable on Google (again).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company announced a partnership that&#x2019;ll see real-time shares from Twitter re-embedded within search results, nearly four years after the end of an earlier agreement forced Google to remove them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tweets are returning to mobile first &#x2014; &#x201C;any browser on your phone or tablet,&#x201D; Google says &#x2014; and desktop in the near future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They&#x2019;re limited to English, for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tweets integrate as you might expect &#x2014; searching for a specific Twitter account, hashtag, or trending topic (e.g., &#x201C;NASA Twitter,&#x201D; &#x201C;#MadMenFinale,&#x201D; or &#x201C;NBA Finals&#x201D;) yields a scrollable carousel of relevant tweets at the top of search results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The tweets themselves are a little pared down from what you might see on Twitter, but still replete with pertinent media like photos, links, and post timestamps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As far as tweet discovery goes, it seems quite useful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Related: Drowning in a deluge of tweets?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The integration doesn&#x2019;t come as a surprise, necessarily &#x2014; Bloomberg reported back in February that Google and Twitter had agreed to a data-sharing deal that&#x2019;d manifest &#x201C;in the first half of this year&#x201D; &#x2014; but it&#x2019;s nonetheless a significant reversal for Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Mountain View-based company launched the microblogging competitor Buzz in 2011, a service which it was quickly forced to shutter because of low usage numbers and controversy surrounding its opaque privacy controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For years, Google has featured content from its own social network, Google+, prominently in its search results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For Twitter, the partnership couldn&#x2019;t come at a better time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>According to Bloomberg, Google&#x2019;s paying a &#x201C;data-licensing&#x201D; fee to access the social network&#x2019;s firehose of real-time data, a line item which brought in $41 million in revenue last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That likely won&#x2019;t placate the investors who sent Twitter stock tumbling 20 percent over the company&#x2019;s Q1 2015 earnings, but it could help to stem its widening losses as it searches for more profitable means of monetization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>If you can&#x2019;t see the integration yet, don&#x2019;t fret &#x2014; Google says it&#x2019;s working on bringing tweet integration &#x201C;to more languages&#x201D; soon.</td></tr>
