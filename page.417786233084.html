<h3>Greek talks failure hits shares, buoys low-risk debt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON Failure in the latest talks aimed at averting a Greek default hurt shares in Europe and Asia on Monday, drove investors into the safety of low-risk government bonds and weighed on the euro.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's clear that each day that passes we come closer to a potential Greek default and this risk aversion is a natural reaction by the market," said KBC strategist Mathias van der Jeugt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The euro EUR= fell against the dollar, with the single currency also under pressure on investor caution before a U.S. interest rate-setting meeting later in the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Talks between Greece and its creditors broke up after less than an hour, raising prospects of Athens being unable to repay 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion dollars) owed to the International Monetary Fund by the end of this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>European Union officials blamed Athens, saying it had not offered new concessions to secure the funding it needs.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 stock index fell 0.8 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Athens stocks fell 6.2 percent while the exporter-heavy German DAX index .GDAXI lost 1.2 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There's been no progress on Greece, so I expect European stock markets will undergo further selling pressure in the near term," said Berkeley Futures' associate director Richard Griffiths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Contagion also affected Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dropped 0.9 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tokyo's Nikkei 225 .N225 index fell 0.1 percent, with traders citing concern over Greece and the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which ends on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Solid U.S. data last week reinforced expectations that the Fed is on track to raise rates for the first time since 2006, possibly as soon as September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Investors will focus on any changes in Fed Chair Janet Yellen's language in a post-meeting news conference.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>Euro/dollar one-month volatility EUR1MO=, a gauge of how sharp swings in the exchange rate are expected to be, hit its highest for 3-1/2 years.</td></tr>
