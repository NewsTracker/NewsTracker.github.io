<h3>Mexico City cabbies slam regulations on ride-sharing apps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Representatives of Mexico City's regular cab drivers are criticizing new regulations published this week on ride-sharing apps such as Uber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pedro Soria of the medallion drivers' group in the capital said at a news conference Friday that the new rules "are totally in favor" of the apps and will create "a playing field that's anything but level."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Under the rules, 1.5 percent of each fare from ride-sharing cabs will go to a "Taxi, Mobility and Pedestrian Fund."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Much of that money may go to regular cabs, to improve their service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The number of ride-sharing cars won't be limited, but drivers won't be allowed to accept cash payments and must keep their vehicles at home.</td></tr>
