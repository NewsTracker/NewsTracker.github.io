<h3>Nintendo President Satoru Iwata dies after leading Japan game company through success, woes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TOKYO - Satoru Iwata, who led Japanese video game company Nintendo Co. through years of growth with its Pokemon and Super Mario franchises, died July 11 of a bile duct tumor, the company said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was 55.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Iwata, president from 2002, died in a Kyoto University hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He had not been seen recently at game events, such as E3 in Los Angeles, where he was usually a participant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Iwata led Nintendo's development into a global company, with its hit Wii home console and DS handheld, and also through its recent woes caused by the popularity of smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His replacement was not immediately announced, but the company said star game designer Shigeru Miyamaoto will remain in the leadership team along with Genyo Takeda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Iwata had been poised to lead Nintendo through another stage after it recently did an about-face and said it will start making games for smartphones - meaning that Super Mario the plumber will start arriving on cellphones and tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The falloff in appetite for game machines in the past few years was partly because people are increasingly playing games or doing social media and other activities on smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nintendo has repeatedly had to lower prices on gadgets to woo buyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Until the recent shift in strategy, company officials including Iwata had repeatedly rejected the idea of developing games for mobile devices, a market that they brushed off for years as irrelevant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In March, Nintendo announced an alliance with Japanese mobile game company DeNA Co. to develop games for mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The company returned to profit in the fiscal year ended March 2015 after several years of losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nintendo pioneered game machines since the 1980s, developing one of the first machines and the hit Game Boy hand-held machine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Its main rivals in the business are Sony Corp. with the PlayStation machines and Microsoft Corp. with the Xbox One machine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Both companies have done better in adapting to the era of online and mobile games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Iwata succeeded Hiroshi Yamauchi, who ruled over the Kyoto-based company for half a century, transforming it from a traditional playing-card company to a technological powerhouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Yamauchi died in 2013 at 85.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Iwata was picked, with Yamauchi's blessing, and Yamauchi remained adviser for many years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Iwata was a respected and popular figure in the game industry, partly because he was relatively more approachable than executives at other Japanese companies, who tend to be aloof and rigid in demeanor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A funeral service will be held on July 17.</td></tr>
