<h3>Robert Durst questioned for 3 hours without attorney: lawyer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>High-powered defense attorney Dick DeGuerin made the claim in an interview with CBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"A prosecutor came out here and took him aside and, you know, questioned him for three hours," DeGuerin told "48 Hours Presents" in an episode that airs Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I would have hoped they would not try to trick him without his lawyer present."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>DeGuerin, who got Durst acquitted for the 2001 murder and dismemberment of neighbor Morris Black in Galveston, Tex., said he was "astonished by the move."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Durst, 71, was arrested Saturday in New Orleans for the 2000 murder of Susan Berman - a day before the finale of an HBO documentary about the New York real estate scion in which he appears to confess he "killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I think it was great drama," DeGuerin said of the snippet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But it's not the truth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>DeGuerin said he understands why the public is fixated on the cross-dressing scion of a Manhattan real estate empire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But, the lawyer added, "I think the case ought to be tried on the facts and not on an effort to win an Emmy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The case against Durst is based on a "junk science letter and a bathroom confession," DeGuerin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In addition to being a Durst confidante, Berman was a Las Vegas mobster's daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And at first Los Angeles police detectives suspected it might have been a mob hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The case was cold until the LAPD learned what Durst said in Andrew Jarecki's film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cops also resurrected an anonymous "cadaver" note tipping them off about Berman's death that an expert concluded - way back in June 2003 - was written by the suspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Retired LAPD Det.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Paul Coulter, who investigated the Berman killing, said he believes they have the goods on Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I'm pretty confident it's Bobby Durst," he told CBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Prosecutors suspect Durst rubbed out Berman to keep her from talking to cops about the disappearance of his first wife, Kathie Durst, who vanished in 1982 without a trace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Durst denies playing any role in her disappearance, but to avoid investigators he high-tailed it to Texas and started dressing like a woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When he was nabbed in NOLA, Durst was reportedly making plans to flee to Cuba.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He had a latex mask to disguise his appearance and $42,000 in cash and a fake Texas ID with the name Everette Ward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Since his arrest, police in Northern California, where Durst lived for a time, are also looking into whether he was involved in the 1997 disappearances of two teenage girls, Kristen Modafferi, 18, and Karen Mitchell, 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>DeGuerin has said that he had nothing to do with the missing teens.</td></tr>

<h3>Blood clots again sideline NASCAR driver Brian Vickers (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Brian Vickers has been sidelined again by blood clots that prevent him from safely driving a race car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Vickers' third bout with blood clots was announced Friday by Michael Waltrip Racing, which replaced him with Brett Moffitt for Sunday's NASCAR race at Auto Club Speedway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''We support Brian,'' said Michael Waltrip, the team founder and co-owner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''We love his heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 31-year-old driver must go back on blood-thinning medication, which makes it too dangerous to race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If Vickers got injured in the car, any bleeding would be difficult or impossible to stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''He's in the care of his doctors and expects to be able to operate normally today,'' Waltrip said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''That's really all the information I have on what his current state is, other than he feels really good and he's really sad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''If he wasn't a race car driver, you wouldn't know there was an issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Waltrip and Vickers were in New Orleans together on Wednesday for a sponsor event before traveling Thursday to the Los Angeles area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>MWR general manager Ty Norris learned of Vickers' condition early Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''He's getting the right treatment,'' Norris said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Norris declined to say where Vickers' blood clots were located.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Waltrip's team has only preliminary information about Vickers' condition, but the driver is in the care of doctors in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Moffitt will return to the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>55 Toyota this weekend after driving it to an impressive eighth-place finish at Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although Vickers has been sidelined by medical issues for the fourth time in his NASCAR tenure, Waltrip wouldn't speculate on whether Vickers' racing career is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''He would not say that, and therefore I can't say that,'' Waltrip said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Vickers missed the first two races of this year following offseason heart surgery to repair a patch on a hole in his heart that his body was rejecting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The heart issue was first discovered in 2010 when Vickers was sidelined with his first bout with blood clots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The blood clots caused Vickers to miss the final five races of the 2013 season because he was placed on blood thinners to treat a clot in his right calf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He also missed 25 races during the 2010 season when clots were discovered in his legs and lungs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>After his December heart surgery kept him out of the car for two weeks, Vickers returned to racing two weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He was 15th at Las Vegas in his return, but was involved in a crash on the first lap at Phoenix last week and finished 41st.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''Thankfully, because I recognized the signs and symptoms, the doctors caught this early and I'm going to be OK,'' Vickers said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''I had finished my treatment for the clot I had in my leg back in 2013 and I haven't needed to be on a blood thinner for a clot in my leg or lung since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Now I won't be able to race because I'll need to be back on a blood thinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Vickers also noted that his latest setback is occurring during ''Blood Clot Awareness Month.'' He was scheduled to help promote the issue at Fontana with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, one of his partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Moffitt had been scheduled to drive this weekend for Front Row Motorsports, a ride he landed after his impressive stint for Vickers at Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Front Row needed a driver to step in for David Ragan, who is replacing the injured Kyle Busch at Joe Gibbs Racing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Moffitt was 37th at Las Vegas and 32nd at Phoenix for Front Row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The MWR development driver was using the Front Row opportunity to get seat time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Chris Buescher will take over for Moffitt at Fontana, making his Sprint Cup Series debut in Front Row's No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>34 Ford.</td></tr>
