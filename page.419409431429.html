<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greek authorities say they are planning to use a ferry currently docked at the island of Kos to transport up to 2,500 migrants to a northern port.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said Tuesday the Eleftherios Venizelos is expected to leave Kos by Wednesday morning to travel to Thessaloniki.</td></tr>
