<h3>Aurora borealis? At this time of year? In this part of the country?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Did you see the aurora borealis last night?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NASA says that an intense geomagnetic storm will mean lots of disturbed particles around earth, and a better chance to see the aurora borealis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This photo was taken in Waterloo Region on Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Thanks to an intense G4 category geomagnetic storm, residents of Waterloo Region could get the chance to see the northern lights again Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The storm means the sun is sending more charged particles our way - and when those particles strike the Earth's magnetic field, they become visible as the aurora.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Tuesday night, region residents looking at the night sky saw the aurora dancing overhead, an unusual sight this far south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Della Stroobosscher sent us this lovely photo of the northern lights in her backyard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But it's not just Waterloo Region - the skies over much of Canada, including the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and parts of B.C., Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador are lighting up in the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Did you see any aurora last night?</td></tr>
