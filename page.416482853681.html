<h3>Android peeing on Apple logo spotted on Google Maps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rivalry between Google and Apple has always been fierce, but now Google Maps appears to have been emblazoned with the image of the Android mascot urinating on an Apple logo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The origin of the image is unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some have suggested it could be Google&#x2019;s idea of an Easter Egg (hidden joke), while others claim it was added by a user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The image is most likely a result of a user abusing Map Maker, the tool that allows users to contribute to Google Maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One Hacker News user claims to have tracked down the culprit &#x2013; a user called nitricboy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We've terminated the Android figure involved in this incident, and he'll be disappearing from Google Maps shortly," a Google spokesperson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Meanwhile, another Hacker News user has spotted an image in the Takht Pari Forest, just a few miles east of the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other images include a smiley face to the east of Islamabad and a Skype logo to the north of Lahore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Still waiting for your Apple Watch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>What is Tesla going to unveil on April 30?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>What is Apple secretly working on?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Is this what an Apple drone would look like?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Should Apple ever choose to manufacture a drone quadrocopter, a German graphic designer has a few ideas for how it should look.</td></tr>
