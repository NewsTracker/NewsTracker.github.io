<h3>MH17 appeal for Buk missile witnesses</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An international crime team investigating the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine last July has produced a video urging witnesses who saw a missile launcher to come forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Describing the Buk launcher as one of the main scenarios, the team says it can provide witnesses with protection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>All 298 people on the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A preliminary Dutch report said the plane broke up after being penetrated by "high-velocity objects".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, the Dutch Safety Board did not specify the involvement of a Russian-made Buk launcher and its final report will not be released until October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Ukrainian government and the West have accused the Russian authorities of supplying the separatists with the Buk missile launcher, providing witness statements and photographs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the Kremlin has argued that Ukrainian forces were responsible for the Malaysia Airlines crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dutch broadcaster RTL said this month it had new evidence from a metal fragment found at the crash site that the plane was hit by a surface-to-air missile, launched from a Russian-made Buk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the video, investigators involved in the criminal investigation show photographs and footage of the launcher being moved around areas of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian rebels, before and after the plane was brought down on 17 July, and the following day when the launcher is alleged to have crossed the border into Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Three phone intercepts are also produced, including two that have not been made public until now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dutch prosecutors say the appeal for witnesses does not mean that the Buk missile launcher is seen as the definitive scenario, as it is too soon to draw conclusions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In the first conversation, separatists are heard at 09:08 on 17 July, several hours before the disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A man in Donetsk asks where the Buk should be taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It needs to be unloaded somewhere in order to hide it," he is heard saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In the second conversation, some five hours after the plane is brought down, a crew member from the Buk has apparently become lost and two separatists are discussing how he can be reunited with his colleagues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A video is then produced appearing to show the launcher being transported on the back of a Volvo low-loader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the final conversation, at around 08:00 on 18 July, a phone intercept suggests the Buk launcher is already over the border in Russia and one of the speakers refers to a "mess" and a "disaster".</td></tr>
