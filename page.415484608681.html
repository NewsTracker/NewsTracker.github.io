<h3>Aztecs to play St. John's in NCAA</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"One of my best friends," Shepard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"He's like my brother, man."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They split for opposite coasts in college - Shepard to San Diego State, Harrison to St. John's in New York - but they talk and text regularly, watching each other's games, wondering if their divergent paths might ever intersect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And they will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The NCAA Tournament can, serendipitously, accommodate that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>SDSU (26-8) received the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>8 seed in the South Region when the 68-team field was unveiled Sunday afternoon - its sixth straight appearance - and will face No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>9 St. John's (21-11) on Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, N.C. The winner likely gets top-seeded Duke on Sunday, in a 20,000-seat arena about 140 miles from its campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We're from the same neighborhood," Shepard said of Harrison, a 6-4 guard who leads the Red Storm in scoring at 17.5 points per game, "and now I have a chance to play against him on a national stage, on national TV, in the tournament. We've never played against each other."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Aztecs have never played the Red Storm in men's basketball, but the connections don't stop with two kids from Missouri City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fifth-year senior Dwayne Polee II spent his freshman season at St. John's before transferring to SDSU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Polee didn't play with anyone on the current Red Storm roster (although he did host Harrison on his recruiting trip).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And he didn't leave out of spite or a lack of playing time, as most transfers do, instead returning to Southern California to be closer to his ill mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I don't feel like I have anything to prove," Polee said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's just going out there and doing what I've got to do to win the basketball game."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Aztecs do, though, have something to prove after a dismal performance in the Mountain West tournament final Saturday in Las Vegas, an ugly 45-43 loss to a Wyoming team they swept during the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But Steve Fisher's team has won 17 straight games following a loss - the longest such active streak in the nation - and, all things considered, probably couldn't have asked for a better opening draw, with more pros than cons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>--A few hours before the brackets were announced, St. John's announced starting center Chris Obekpa has been suspended for two weeks for an undisclosed violation of team rules that New York media reported stems from a failed drug test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Obekpa averages just 5.8 points, but he is the school's career blocks leader (324) and second in rebounding (7.0) on a team that starts four guards, brings no other big off the bench and has struggled on the boards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>--The Red Storm has been wildly inconsistent, capable of producing some genuine clunkers, and it's not exactly soaring into the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Their last two outings: a 105-68 loss at Villanova (in which Obekpa didn't play) and a 74-57 loss to Providence in the Big East tournament opener after sweeping the Friars in the regular season.</td></tr>
