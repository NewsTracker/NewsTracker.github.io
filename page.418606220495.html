<h3>Yahoo Files to Spin Off Alibaba Shares</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The name selected for the new public company is Aabaco Holdings Inc., Yahoo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After the spinoff, Aabaco will own about 384 million Alibaba shares, representing about a 15% stake in the Chinese electric-commerce giant, and a 100% stake in a new entity that will own Yahoo Small Business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yahoo Small Business is a division that sells tools to help small-business owners market and sell their goods online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Aabaco will operate as a closed-end fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Its investment objective "is to seek returns for its stockholders primarily through owning the Alibaba shares," the filing said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fund plans to invest at least 80% of its total assets in Alibaba shares under normal market conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Alibaba's blockbuster IPO in 2014 provided about $6.3 billion in cash for Yahoo, after taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Yahoo said in January that it would spin off its remaining stake in Alibaba into a new company owned by Yahoo shareholders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yahoo expects the transaction to occur in the fourth quarter, after its one-year lockup agreement with Alibaba expires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tax treatment is a key question for the transaction, which Yahoo is planning as a tax-free spinoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Yahoo shares fell after a May 19 Bloomberg News report that said the Internal Revenue Service was considering changes to its rules governing spinoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At the time, a Yahoo spokeswoman said the company didn't expect that any IRS changes would affect its previously filed ruling request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In the filing Friday, the company said it is still awaiting a ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Yahoo noted the risk that the agency may not issue a favorable ruling, or that administrative guidance "could adversely impact the tax-free treatment."</td></tr>
