<h3>Netherlands pulls out of hosting 2019 European Games</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BAKU (Reuters) - Netherlands has surprisingly pulled out of hosting the 2019 European Games two days before the inaugural continental multi-sports competition starts in Azerbaijan, the European Olympic Committees (EOC) said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Dutch government were the only bidders for the Games, a new concept along the lines of the Pan-American and Asian Games, when they were awarded the event less than a month ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The decision could not have come at a worse time for the EOC, desperate to pitch the Games as a valued addition to the already crowded international sports calendar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This news is disappointing, but we would like to thank the Dutch for their interest," said EOC chairman Patrick Hickey in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I have no doubt that we will be able to present a strong host for the 2019 European Games, but right now our focus remains on ensuring this inaugural edition is the best possible launch pad for Europe's first continental Games."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Azerbaijan spent millions building new venues and refurbishing existing ones for an event that will include 20 sports, 16 of which are Olympic ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A dozen sports are offering direct or indirect qualification for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Dutch had submitted a nationwide proposal rather than staging the Games in one city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The EOC said it would now resume talks with other potential hosts but said all discussions will be held in private.</td></tr>
