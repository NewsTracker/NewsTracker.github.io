<h3>World leaders slap Netanyahu?s call for Jews to flee</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Some leaders accused the Israeli prime minister of exploiting terror attacks to boost his chances in an upcoming election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I can't allow things to be said in Israel that would lead one to think that Jews have no place in Europe and particularly France," French President Francois Hollande said near Paris after vandals damaged about 300 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in northeastern France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Many Western lawmakers see Netanyahu's rhetoric as aimed at boosting his standing ahead of a closely contested March reelection bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The fact that you're in an election campaign doesn't mean you can just make any statement," French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The place for French Jews is France."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Following dual terror attacks in Copenhagen that included the fatal shooting of a man guarding a synagogue during a bat mitzvah, Netanyahu suggested on Sunday that European Jews move to Israel for safety.</td></tr>

<h3>Imagine Dragons drummer Daniel Platzman discusses 'second album syndrome', Grammy feud</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>How would they have reacted if raging rapper Kanye West attempted to hijack their moment in the spotlight while they were collecting their award at last year's ceremony?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I would have had the mindset of, 'Oh my goodness, we're big enough that Kanye just stormed the stage!' laughs Dragons drummer Daniel Platzman from across the pond in London, England, where the group is in the midst of a media blitz in support of their brand new album, Smoke + Mirrors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And even though Kanye didn't win over a ton of music fans after his recent Grammy tirade aimed at Beck, Platzman manages to put a positive spin on the controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Speaking of winning, let's recap the victorious last few years for the Las Vegas foursome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Buoyed by the success of the band's debut album, 2012's Night Visions, which contained the mega-selling and infectious single Radioactive, the group quickly ascended from playing tiny clubs to selling out arenas across North America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Millions of albums sold later, the band is tasked with following up that record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mobile users, click here to watch a music video for Shots off the band's new album Smoke + Mirrors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a Canadian newspaper exclusive, Platzman touches on the band's meteoric rise, the dreaded 'second album syndrome' and the Grammy controversy surrounding rockers Queens of the Stone Age - which led to their frontman, Josh Homme, declaring "f--- the Imagine Dragons!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The album seems like a natural progression from the first record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Was this the goal?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That was the goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>We weren't trying to fall into any of the pitfalls that come with a second album.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Night Visions was really successful and so I feel like we could have gone into it with the mindset of, 'Let's re-create everything we just did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Let's do it again because everyone seemed to like it.' But that's not coming from an honest place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Really, we just wanted to make music we could stand behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Did you feel any pressure going into the studio from either yourselves or from outside sources?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>We pretty much live in a bubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Our friends and family were the ones telling us 'Things are changing, things are crazy.' For us, we were just continuing to write music and playing shows the audience was slowly getting bigger and bigger and the back wall was getting further and further back (laughs).</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We didn't have a chance to feel any of that pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>We were pretty focused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Going from playing tiny clubs to arenas in a few short years, winning a Grammy, a platinum album in 12 countries does the rapid and successful rise of the band blow you away at all?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It's definitely not something that we expected or felt entitled to at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Does is surprise me?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Sure. But we are also doing this because we love playing shows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>All the awards and record-breaking stuff is incredible but it's not why we're doing this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>We're still very satisfied to get up on stage and to bring our music around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That's what it's really all about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>When you guys played the Air Canada Centre in Toronto last year, lead singer Dan Reynolds said, "We have Vegas luck on our side."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Do you think this is the case, or do you think you make your own luck with hard work and determination?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>There are plenty of amazing bands out there that had all the hard work and determination in the world, but didn't get the opportunities they deserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Luck absolutely plays a part in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Detractors inevitably come with success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>How do you guys deal with negative press or the backlash that any band gets after gaining a huge amount of popularity?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>We're starting to get a little bit of negative press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>We were just talking about this last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Our bass player Ben McKee said, 'When we started this band, we were dreaming about being successful enough to get negative press' (laughs).</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>It's pretty amazing that we're at a point that we're getting it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>We take it with a grain of salt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme was pretty upset that you beat his band for the Best Rock Performance Grammy last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>What did you think of him dropping an F-bomb in the direction of your band?</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>We've actually hung out with Josh since then and we're totally cool.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>It's rock 'n' roll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>I don't think he was that upset with us we've buried the hatchet since then, and we even did a photo for his charity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>I'm a huge QOTSA fan they kick ass.</td></tr>
