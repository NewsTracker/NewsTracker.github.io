<h3>Ukraine's rebels mete out rough justice in authority vacuum</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A man stands tied to a post by pro-Russian rebels, accused of stealing from local people, with a poster around his neck reading "I am marauder, I beat and steal from civilians", standing next to a highway in Krasnyi Partyzan, Ukraine, Thursday, April 23, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>KRASNYI PARTYZAN, Ukraine (AP) - A bruised rebel fighter in battle fatigues is tied to a traffic pole, avoiding glances as a crude message hung about his neck flutters in the wind: "I am a marauder. I beat up and robbed my countrymen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The man's captors were not his foes, but fellow separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the maelstrom of conflict, summary justice has become commonplace in rebel-controlled areas, and it targets civilians and combatants alike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rebel unit commander Alexander Nazarchenko stood a few paces away from the humiliated fighter in the town of Krasnyi Partyzan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said he consulted with superiors before taking such a drastic measure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The man's offenses, he explained, were particularly outrageous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He assaulted a civilian, stole his car, took cash from his relatives," Nazarchenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"He said he was borrowing the money, but that isn't exactly how you borrow money."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The victim reported the fighter to rebel authorities, who sentenced him to trench-digging duties - the standard punishment among the rebel militia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Undeterred, the fighter got drunk and stole back the car from the same victim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>These types of incidents are fruit of the chaos - judicial, bureaucratic and economic - that has prevailed in eastern Ukraine throughout the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Andrei Pasichnik, deputy head of police in Luhansk, the second largest separatist-held city, condemned the arbitrary justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But he conceded that much work remained to get a proper justice system in rebel areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When officials loyal to the central government in Kiev were forced out last year, they appear to have taken much of the cash and resources with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pasichnik said efforts are now focused on installing police departments in areas under nominal Luhansk rebel control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There are no judges, so sentences are directly passed down by prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Things are slightly better in the neighboring Donetsk region, where rebels have fashioned a would-be breakaway state dubbed the Donetsk People's Republic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In early April, the head of the top rebel court, Eduard Yakubovsky, said tribunals had only resumed administering civil, family and criminal cases three months earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The separatist justice system is modeled on the old Soviet one, albeit on a far smaller scale than earlier as money is short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Before, in the territory of the Donetsk region, there were 55 local courts ... employing 3,262 people. That's the size of a full-fledged mechanized infantry unit," Yakubovsky said at a press conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The number of judges has now been reduced fourfold."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That has provided fertile ground for kangaroo courts, particularly in areas under control of Cossack commanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Cossacks are members of a semi-military group that traditionally guarded the far-flung outposts of the Russian empire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Pasichnik said that anybody taking the law into their own hands and administering punishments such as whipping or even executions would face criminal charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Vigilante justice? No. Only the law-enforcement system has the right to that," Pasichnik said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"The Cossacks ... did cooperate with us before, of course, but there were certain individuals that tried to create their mini-states."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That was a veiled reference to Cossack commanders like Nikolai Kozitsyn, a Russian national who ruled over the town of Perevalsk in defiance of Ukrainian and rebel authorities alike.</td></tr>
