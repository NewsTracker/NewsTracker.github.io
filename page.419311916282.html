<h3>Coghlan hits 2 HRs, Rizzo goes deep, Cubs beat White Sox 6-5 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) -- Chris Coghlan hit two home runs, Anthony Rizzo also went deep, and the Chicago Cubs made it eight straight wins and 14 in 15 games with a 6-5 victory over the crosstown White Sox on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Cubs, coming off a 7-0 homestand, extended their longest win streak since a nine-game run during the 2008 NL Central championship season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Coghlan hit a three-run homer in the top of the third, and then he and Rizzo added back-to-back solo drives off the struggling Jeff Samardzija (8-8) in the fifth to give the North Siders a 6-5 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dexter Fowler tripled, double and scored two runs, and the Cubs won again even though Kyle Hendricks got knocked out in the fourth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Four relievers combined to shut down the White Sox the rest of the way, with Clayton Richard (3-0) working two innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pedro Strop escaped a first-and-second jam in the eighth, striking out Adam Eaton and Tyler Saladino to end the inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hector Rondon pitched the ninth for his 20th save in 24 chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But with Samardzija getting hit hard while dropping his third straight start, the White Sox came up short after sweeping three games from the Los Angeles Angels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The longtime Cubs pitcher went six innings, allowing six runs and nine hits in his first appearance against his former team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Samardzija's ERA in his past three starts is 12.91.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Cubs, trailing Pittsburgh by 1 1/2 games for the first NL wild card and leading San Francisco by 4 1/2 for the second when the day began, were up 4-2 after Coghlan's three-run homer in the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The White Sox answered with three in the fourth while chasing Hendricks, the big blow being a two-run homer by Eaton after Geovany Soto's RBI single.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But two swings by Coghlan and Rizzo with two out in the fifth put the Cubs back on top, 6-5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Coghlan's drive to center gave him two multi-homer games this season and five in his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rizzo followed with his 23rd homer and second in as many games when he sent a drive to right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was the fourth time this season and second consecutive game that the Cubs hit back-to-back homers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Cubs: Manager Joe Maddon said RHP Rafael Soriano (right shoulder inflammation) is getting close to pitching in simulated games and will then go on a rehab assignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>White Sox: INF Emilio Bonifacio (strained left oblique) was reinstated from the 15-day disabled list and INF Leury Garcia was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Cubs: With a career-high 17 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings, RHP Jake Arrieta (13-6, 2.38 ERA) looks to keep the streak going.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He is 7-1 in his past 10 starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>White Sox: LHP Jose Quintana (6-9, 3.59) goes for his first career win against the Cubs.</td></tr>
