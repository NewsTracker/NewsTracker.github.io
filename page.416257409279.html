<h3>Teens not keen on Apple Watch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Varieties of the new Apple Watch are on display in the demo room after an Apple event in San Francisco on Monday, March 9, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Just 11 per cent of U.S. 13-19-year-olds are planning to buy the iPhone maker's first smartwatch, according to a new survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The biannual Taking Stock with Teens report, compiled by investment bank Piper Jaffray from responses from over 7000 participants, shows that interest in the Apple Watch is actually declining -- the October edition of the report found that 16 per cent of teens had an Apple Watch on their shopping list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>According to the latest edition of the report, only five per cent of U.S. teens currently sport a smartwatch of any description and, of the 11 per cent of respondents that are going to buy an Apple Watch, the device's style and focus on design are the driving forces behind the decision -- not health or fitness tracking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In fact, less than half of those interested in getting Apple's first smartwatch are interested in those functions or features.</td></tr>
