<h3>Separatist commander killed in Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A separatist commander in eastern Ukraine was killed along with several other fighters after their car came under attack on Saturday, rebel authorities have announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The defence ministry of the self-proclaimed Lugansk republic confirmed that Alexey Mozgovoy, the commander of a police battalion in the war-torn region, was among the dead and said it was hunting for the assailants behind the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The incident happened around 3pm GMT near the town of Alchevsk, some 40 kilometres (27 miles) from Lugansk, the official press agency of the self-declared republic said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"According to the preliminary information, the vehicle carrying Mozgovoy was hit by a bomb and then by machine-gun fire," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There are seven dead in total," deputy Lugansk prosecutor Sergei Gorenko said at a press conference broadcast by Russian media, though he stressed that the toll was based on early information and could still change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"One of the lines of inquiry is that it was an act of sabotage by a group of spies," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mozgovoy was the well-known leader of the so-called Prizrak (Ghost) brigade that has taken part in some of the heaviest battles in Ukraine's pro-Russian east since the start of the conflict last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In December, the United States added his name to a list of people subject to sanctions for their involvement in the crisis, which has left more than 6,200 people dead so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A leader of the neighbouring separatist region of Donetsk, Andrei Purgin, told Russian news agencies that he wanted to see a speedy investigation, warning that Kiev would "use the situation to pour oil on the fire".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A shaky European-brokered ceasefire agreed in February has largely held despite sporadic flare-ups of fighting in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>According to a daily toll update by the Ukrainian army on Saturday, one soldier was killed and five others injured in the conflict zone over the past 24 hours.</td></tr>
