<h3>Egypt executes man for throwing 2 to their deaths from roof</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Interior Ministry, which is in charge of police, said in a statement that Mahmoud Ramadan was behind the deaths of a young man and a child who were thrown off a rooftop in Alexandria, during large protests demanding Mohammed Morsi's reinstatement after the military removed him from power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The famous murderer of children thrown from a rooftop during the violence, intimidation and thuggery carried out by supporters of the former president ... was executed this morning," chief prosecutor Hisham Barakat said later in a separate statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said Ramadan and others convicted of crimes that day used weapons including firearms to sow panic and were responsible for the violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rights group Amnesty International said that the execution came after an unfair trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"According the defense team the primary lawyer (in the case) was arrested ahead of the trial and released after it finished," said Amnesty's Egypt researcher Mohamed Elmessiry, adding that the trial did not address police unwillingness to stop the day's violence, investigate the killing of Morsi supporters killed the same day, and that it used video evidence that did not reflect the whole picture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Another man was also sentenced to death for the killings, which happened two days after Morsi's July 3, 2013 overthrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Footage repeatedly aired on national television showed one of the men roaming the roof raising a black flag often used by Islamic militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At least 16 others were also killed in Alexandria that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of those killed was a child, who witnesses including an Associated Press journalist said was stabbed and then thrown off the roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A young man was hurled to his death and Morsi supporters were seen beating his lifeless body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The violence set the tone for months to come.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Authorities launched a harsh crackdown on Morsi supporters and banned his Muslim Brotherhood group, killing hundreds of protesters and flooding jails with tens of thousands of detainees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The move largely stamped out dissent, although small scale attacks and bombings still take place regularly in Cairo and other cities and a militant insurgency continues in the restive northern part of the Sinai Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Interior Ministry Spokesman Maj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Gen. Hany Abdel-Latif said Ramadan's execution was the first involving Morsi supporters implicated in violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Also Saturday, a bomb exploded in front of an Emirati bank branch north of the capital, killing a policeman and a civilian and wounding 16, the latest of several attacks by suspected militants seeking to destabilize the government over the last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Security and health officials from Gharbiya province said the bomb went off overnight in Mahalla, 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Cairo, near a local Emirates NBD branch.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>The other victims were still receiving treatment.</td></tr>

<tr><td>21</td><td>The bank, Dubai's largest, declined to comment and did not make executives available to discuss the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>United Arab Emirates is one of several Gulf countries that have sent billions of dollars in aid to back Egypt's current government, led by ex-army chief President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the overthrow of Morsi.</td></tr>

<h3>Official: Some black players not true victims of racism</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Artur Grigoryants, head of the Russian Football Union's disciplinary committee, was commenting on cases in which his commission had issued multi-game bans to black players who made rude gestures to fans following racist abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Speaking to The Associated Press, Grigoryants referred to the players in question - including former Queens Park Rangers defender Christopher Samba - as "so-called, in inverted commas, victims" and insisted it was right to punish them for losing "control."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Russia, the 2018 World Cup host, has only "rare cases of racism" at stadiums, Grigoryants added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Samba was banned for two games in September for gesturing to Torpedo Moscow fans who taunted him with monkey chants while he played a Russian Premier League game for Dynamo Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He showed an unpleasant gesture to the stands and that's a punishable offense," Grigoryants said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Yes, there was a provocation from the stands but a player should keep himself under control and so we decided to punish the club for the occurrence and we punished Samba."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Torpedo was ordered to close part of its stadium for one game as a result of the abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In similar cases in Russia, Ivorian defender Dacosta Goore was banned for two games in 2013 for gesturing to racially abusive Spartak Moscow fans, and Gabonese midfielder Guelor Kanga received a three-game ban for the same offense in November, also while playing against Spartak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Goore's case, Spartak was fined for racist abuse, but it was not punished over Kanga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Grigoryants said the disciplinary committee had not been able to prove there had been racist abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Grigoryants also said that Russia has only "rare cases of racism" at stadiums, adding: "We're on the way to liquidating it completely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His comments clash with a report published last week by two anti-discrimination organizations, which detailed more than 200 cases of discriminatory behavior linked to Russian soccer over two seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In response to the report, FIFA president Sepp Blatter told the AP that Russia could face sanctions if its record on racism does not improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Tuesday, the football union's general secretary Anatoly Vorobyov told the AP that the organization would crack down on the "virus" of racism ahead of the World Cup and suggested that enforcement of existing anti-racism measures had been lax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We have enough disciplinary measures which are laid out in our regulations. On the other hand, perhaps they need to be used more strictly," Vorobyov said.</td></tr>
