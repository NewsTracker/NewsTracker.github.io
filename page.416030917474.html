<tr><td>3</td><td>PRAGUE (AP) - Czech President Milos Zeman and the U.S. ambassador to Prague are in a rare public dispute over Zeman's decision to attend a Russian military parade, and the country's prime minister together with Czech lawmakers are siding with the American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In an interview with online publication Parlamentni Listy on Sunday, Zeman bristled at the envoy's implied criticism of his decision to attend Moscow's traditional May 9 military parade despite the crisis in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Zeman said U.S. Ambassador Andrew Shapiro is no longer welcome in the Prague Castle, the seat of presidency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I think that the reaction of President Zeman was not adequate," Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said.</td></tr>
