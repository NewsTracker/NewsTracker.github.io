<h3>Dozens feared killed in Vanuatu by 'catastrophic' Cyclone Pam</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The full extent of the damage is unknown, with limited communications in place after Super Cyclone Pam, a maximum category five storm, slammed into the island nation late on Friday with gusts up to 320km/h.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The UN had unconfirmed reports of 44 people killed in one province, and said late on Saturday there was no clear number of deaths or injuries but the impact of the cyclone had been "catastrophic".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The eye of the storm passing over Vanuatu early on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale used a speech at a UN conference in Sendai, Japan, to appeal for international assistance on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and people of Vanuatu to the global community to give a lending hand in responding to these very current calamities that have struck us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Aid agencies were preparing to send teams to Vanuatu, whose main island is home to more than 65,000 people, with a UN disaster assessment and coordination team expected to arrive late on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"While it is too early to say for certain, early reports are indicating that this weather disaster could potentially be one of the worst in Pacific history," UNICEF New Zealand's Executive Director Vivien Maidaborn said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The sheer force of the storm combined with communities just not set up to withstand it, could have devastating results for thousands across the region."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Aurelia Balpe, head of the Pacific regional office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said there were unconfirmed reports of casualties in the capital Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But they had greater fears for outlying southern islands, home to more than 33,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are very worried just because there are less permanent structures in that part of the country," Balpe said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Residents of Port Vila spent the night hunkering down as the storm raged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The scene here this morning is complete devastation - houses are destroyed, trees are down, roads are blocked and people are wandering the streets looking for help," said Save the Children's Tom Skirrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The storm crossed the main Vanuatu island and a group of islands further south after affecting the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, where there were no reports of fatalities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Aid agencies have launched appeals and are hoping to start flying in emergency supplies of food, shelter and medicine from Sunday, when the airport in Port Vila is expected to reopen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said medical and search and rescue staff were on standby while New Zealand announced $NZ1 million ($A959,500) in initial funds to assist Vanuatu, Fiji, Tuvalu and the Solomon Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The European Union also pledged 1 million euros ($A1.38 million) for emergency relief efforts while the UK promised 2 million pounds ($A3.87 million).</td></tr>

<h3>Rain delays next leg of solar plane's round-the-world trip</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The aircraft had been due to leave Ahmedabad city in the western state of Gujarat on Sunday and travel on to Myanmar after a short stopover in the holy city of Varanasi in northern India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But weather forecasts showed there was a good chance of rain in Ahmedabad on Saturday night (local time), and organisers said that "due to the weather", the plane would now take off on Tuesday, March 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A senior Ahmedabad airport official who asked not to be named said the team would assess the flying conditions on Monday evening, adding that "moisture levels are higher than usual at this time of the year".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Solar Impulse 2 landed in Ahmedabad about midnight on Tuesday, finishing its second leg in little less than 16 hours after taking off from the Omani capital Muscat to break a distance record for solar planes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The sea legs pose the greatest challenge for the Solar Impulse team as any loss of power over the water would leave the pilot no alternative but to bail out and await rescue by boat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Much bigger crossings lie ahead as Swiss pilots Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, who alternate at the controls of the single-seat aircraft, traverse the great oceans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The longest single leg will see one of them fly solo non-stop for five days and nights across the Pacific from Nanjing, China, to Hawaii, a distance of 8,500 kilometres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Muscat was the first of 12 planned stops on the plane's journey around the world from Abu Dhabi, with a total flight time of around 25 days spread over five months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Monday's maiden leg took Borschberg 13 hours and two minutes, while Piccard's flight to Ahmedabad of 1,468 kilometres was said to be the longest point-to-point distance flown by a solar-powered plane.</td></tr>
