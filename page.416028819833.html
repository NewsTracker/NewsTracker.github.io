<h3>Prince Ali expects sponsors to snub FIFA if Blatter stays</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali bin al-Hussein believes the scandal-hit organization will struggle to replace sponsors and be hurt financially if Sepp Blatter remains in charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Five of FIFA's top 14 sponsors decided in recent months not to extend their deals, leaving a void ahead of the high-profile qualifying draw event for the 2018 World Cup in Russia in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>None of the departing sponsors, including Sony and Emirates airline, spoke out publicly against world football's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Prince Ali of Jordan has used his FIFA manifesto, which was launched on Monday, to express concerns that corruption allegations around FIFA are putting off commercial backers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Make no mistake: the damage which is being exacted upon 'Brand FIFA' has financial implications," the FIFA vice president writes in the manifesto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Sponsors have begun to vote with their feet. If drastic action is not taken urgently to restore the image of our governing body, we can expect revenues to reduce and, in turn, monies available to national associations to also go down."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FIFA said in January it was in "advanced negotiations" with potential partners for the 2018 World Cup, but no information on new sponsors have been announced since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We should have a situation where sponsors are not only willing to come back but we should have sponsors fighting to sponsor FIFA," Prince Ali said in an interview with The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Obviously I would like to see (the sponsors) back but we also like to see other options as well. It is important to have an organization that has a good reputation that sponsors feel totally confident in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>FIFA revenue topped $2 billion last year, adding $91 million to its reserves, which now stand at $1.523 billion after a widely-praised World Cup in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"FIFA is riding on the success of the World Cup," Prince Ali said from Cairo where he is campaigning at a Confederation of African Football meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We could gain so much more if there was more faith and more trust in how FIFA is run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If it is run correctly, if confidence is brought back into the organization by sponsors, by fans and so on there is so much more revenue we can gain and that revenue in itself will go back into our national associations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prince Ali is one of three candidates trying to stop Blatter being re-elected for a fifth, four-year term in May along with Dutch FA head Michael van Praag and former Portugal international Luis Figo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Prince Ali is more reluctant than his rivals to talk up expanding the World Cup beyond 32 teams for political reasons ahead of the May 29 poll.</td></tr>
