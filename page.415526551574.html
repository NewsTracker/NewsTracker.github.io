<h3>Tuberculosis and superbug strains "ravaging" Europe, WHO warns</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At current rates, the region has little chance of meeting a target to eliminate it by 2050, according to a joint report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"MDR-TB (multi-drug resistant TB) is still ravaging the European Region, making it the most affected area of the entire world," Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO's regional director, said as the report was published.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>TB is a contagious bacterial lung disease that occurs mainly in areas of poverty and deprivation and spreads via the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is hard to treat, requiring months of antibiotic treatment, and drug resistant strains are rapidly gaining a foothold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>TB in all its forms killed around 1.5 million people worldwide in 2013 and the WHO warned last year that rates of MDR-TB were "crisis levels".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The WHO's European region covers 53 countries with a population of nearly 900 million, of which around 508 million live in the European Union and European Economic Area EU/EEA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tuesday's WHO/ECDC report said the overall trend across the region showed TB rates falling in some high-priority countries, while the disease is fighting back in other low-incidence countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the EU/EEA, some 65,000 TB cases were reported in 2013, it said, with 360,000 cases in the whole WHO European region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"At the current pace of an annual 6 percent decline, the EU/EEA will only be free of tuberculosis in the next century," said Marc Sprenger, director of the Stockholm-based ECDC which monitors disease in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said that for Europe to reach elimination -- defined as less than one case of TB per 1 million population per year -- by 2050, it would have to cut down cases at least twice as fast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Our data show a Europe in need of tailored interventions which target each country's settings," Sprenger said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In most countries were TB is relatively uncommon, rates are either stable or going down only very slowly, he said, and the majority of patients are of foreign origin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Countries with larger TB problems, however, also have higher rates of re-infection and report many more cases of multi-drug resistant TB.</td></tr>

<h3>Kremlin rules out handing back Crimea to Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Russian and Crimean flags flutter in the wind during celebrations marking the first anniversary of Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, in central Simferopol March 16, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia ruled out handing Crimea back to Ukraine on Tuesday and a Defense Ministry official said nuclear-capable long-range bombers were being sent to the Black Sea peninsula as part of war games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The huge military exercises, in which the Northern Fleet was put on full alert on Monday and will range from the Arctic to the Black Sea, appear to be a show of force and defiance on the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Russia's parliament approved the annexation on March 21 last year after Russian forces took control of the peninsula, which is home to Russia's Black Sea Fleet, and residents backed joining the Russian Federation in a referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dismissing a U.S. pledge to keep economic sanctions in place on Russia over the annexation, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "Crimea is a region of the Russian Federation and of course the subject of our regions is not up for discussion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Russia announced the start of military drills on Monday involving more than 45,000 troops as well as war planes and submarines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Interfax news agency quoted an unidentified Defense Ministry official as saying on Tuesday the exercises would include the deployment of Tu-22M3 bombers in Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The official also said long-range Iskander ballistic missiles were being sent to the Kaliningrad exclave bordering NATO members Lithuania and Poland for the war games, which also involve the Baltic Fleet and the Southern Military District.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The military exercises - after President Vladimir Putin's first public appearance since March 5 - are the latest sign of Russia flexing its muscles since the start of the crisis in Ukraine, where Russia backs separatists fighting Kiev's forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, said in January that Crimea, Kaliningrad and the Arctic would be priority areas this year as the military strengthens its combat capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>NATO's top military commander, General Philip Breedlove, has said Russia's "militarization" of Crimea could be used to exert control over the Black Sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Any military build-up on NATO's doorstep in Kaliningrad is also a concern for the Western alliance, while the Arctic's mineral riches and energy reserves ensure that territory there is contested by several nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Russian forces seized control of Crimea after the overthrow of a Ukrainian president backed by Moscow, a move described by Russian officials as a coup which threatened the safety of Crimea's mainly Russian-speaking population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday Washington would keep economic sanctions in place on Russia as long as Crimea remains under Russian rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the 28-nation bloc would also stick to its policy of not recognizing the annexation and pursuing sanctions.</td></tr>
