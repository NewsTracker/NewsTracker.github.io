<h3>Rep. Schock billed taxpayers for private plane to Bears game</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Schock repays taxpayers more than $1,200 for private plane to Bears game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Aaron Schock billed taxpayers at least three times for a total of more than $14,000 in private air travel last fall, including for a trip to a Chicago Bears football game, The Associated Press has learned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The newly revealed expenses encompass plane travel around Illinois and to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They add to the list of more than a dozen flights worth $40,000 aboard planes owned by donors, which led to a formal ethics complaint against the Peoria Republican.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>U.S. Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Aaron Schock's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week has turned into his terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Monday, a spokesman for Schock said the congressman has reimbursed the U.S. government for more than $1,200 for travel to the Bears game last November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Schock previously charged the private air travel to his House office account, which is funded by taxpayers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Schock will continue a thorough review of his office procedures, the spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Schock earlier brought on board a team of campaign finance lawyers and public relations experts to address the controversy about his expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Congressional rules updated two years ago generally allow the use of private aircraft as long as trips are fairly compensated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the latest revelations about Schock's travel expenses raise questions about why taxpayers would be billed for a trip to Chicago when he represents the Peoria and Springfield areas at least 150 miles away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Newly released House records show $10,802 incurred last November for "commercial transportation" to Keith Siilats, a New York-based pilot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Siilats told the AP he flew the congressman between Washington and Peoria for a series of meetings, and attended the Bears game with Schock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That trip was first reported Sunday by the Chicago Sun-Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The records also show Schock's office spent about $2,270 with Peoria-based Byerly Aviation, as well as $1,590 to Lobair LLC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Both were previously paid for Schock's travel on aircraft owned by his financial contributors, records show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Byerly expense aligns with a same-day journey on a plane owned by Springfield businessman Todd Green between Peoria and Quincy, Illinois, on Dec. 12, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That same day in Quincy, Schock toured a local dam that he said needed repairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Byerly was previously paid $11,433 from Schock's office account for four days in November 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The AP found Green's plane traveled to and from Washington and Peoria during that same period - and hours before Schock posted a photo about his "Schocktoberfest" fundraising event in his district.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A Schock spokesman on Monday referred to the congressman's earlier statements that he takes compliance with funding rules seriously and has begun a review of his expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Schock previously told the AP he travels frequently throughout his district to stay connected with his constituents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Schock, 33, has been under scrutiny for using congressional funds to redecorate his Capitol Hill office in the style of the TV show "Downton Abbey."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Last week, his office said he made good on his promise of personally reimbursing those costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A liberal-leaning group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, had requested an investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics, an outside panel that reviews ethics complaints against House members.</td></tr>

<h3>Department of Justice to criticize Ferguson police in report due soon: NY Times</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The police department's behavior created a tense racial environment and culture of animosity between black residents and police in Ferguson, the newspaper said, citing several officials who have been briefed on the report's conclusions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That tension erupted in massive protests against police after Brown, who was unarmed, was shot by white police officer Darren Wilson in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Justice Department launched a pair of investigations into the police department after the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Attorney General Eric Holder said after visiting Ferguson last year that many black residents expressed mistrust and fear of police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One of his department's probes sought to determine whether police created a culture that was so unfair to certain racial groups that it infringed on their civil rights.The Justice Department said it would examine how Ferguson police use force, conduct stops and treat detainees, and whether they engaged in discriminatory practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The final report could lead to a civil rights suit against Ferguson police unless officials are able to reach a settlement with the Justice Department, The New York Times said.</td></tr>
