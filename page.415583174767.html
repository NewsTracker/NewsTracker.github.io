<h3>Ivan Rakitic helped beat Man City... but who is the midfielder who almost joined Chelsea at 16?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Of all the players Manchester City might have expected to drive the final nail into their Champions League coffin Ivan Rakitic was a long way down the list, but it was the former Sevilla midfielder who got the goal on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Here MailSport takes a closer look at the Croatian midfielder more than proving his worth in his first season at the Nou Camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When he signed in the summer what was the reaction?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There was no hysteria but it was considered a welcome addition for two reasons - firstly they need midfielders after selling Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea and Thiago to Bayern Munich, and second Rakitic was, along with his fellow countryman Luka Modric, the best midfielder in La Liga last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Is he an improvement on the aforementioned Fabregas and Thiago?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Thiago has the potential to be the best of the three but appalling luck with injuries has stalled his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Is Rakitic better than Cesc?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Probably not but he has many of the same characteristics so that has made him a worthy replacement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And those characteristics are?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He is versatile in as much as he can play behind the striker and score goals as he did regularly for his former club Sevilla and he can play deep in front of the centre-back as he also did, although less so for his former team, and as he did for Barca last Saturday away at Eibar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Much like his compatriot at Real Madrid Modric, he can tackle, pass, and shoot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He's a very complete midfielder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Who brought him to Spain?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sevilla signed him from Schalke for 2.5m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It was another work of genius from the club's Sporting Director Monchi because within a very short space of time it was clear Rakitic was destined for bigger things and would make the club a tidy profit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His wife, Raquel Mauri, is a hairdresser from Sevilla, and so he preferred to stay in Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>When Barcelona came calling it was a no-brainer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He was close to going to Chelsea as a 16-year-old but his father advised him to move to Schalke instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The language was not going to be a problem wherever he went because the Swiss born Croatian international speaks five languages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And his battle with Modric will be one to look out for on Sunday?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And even more so because Rakitic was denied the chance to face his international team-mate in the first Clasico of the season because he was left out of the starting eleven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>How did that work out for Luis Enrique?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Badly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Many had tipped the coach to resist the temptation of giving Luis Suarez his debut after so long out, move Iniesta forward to the front three and bring in Xavi alongside Rakitic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Instead Luis Enrique dropped Rakitic despite the fact that he had been playing well and lined Xavi up alongside Andres Iniesta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>'They are great players but they are not getting any younger,' Paul Clement told me after the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Barca started well but lost control of midfielder and ultimately the match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Without Rakitic they were completely out-run in the middle of the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>When he is at his best, he is their engine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Now he's back in the team for good?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He didn't start against Malaga and Barca lost 1-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He then played and scored against Granada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He is becoming a leader on the pitch and has bought into the ideas of sacrifice and generosity at Barcelona having been very much the talisman of the team at Sevilla.</td></tr>

<h3>U.S. has flown 2,320 strikes against Islamic State at a cost of $1.83 billion: official</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The strikes by U.S. forces amounted to about 80 percent of the total number carried out by a multinational coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In all, the partners have flown 2,893 air strikes, with 1,631 in Iraq and 1,262 in Syria, hitting 5,314 targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>More than 60 countries are in the coalition against Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom conduct air strikes in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The United States, Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates carry them out in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pentagon spokesman Army Colonel Steve Warren confirmed that U.S. and Iraqi forces had also dropped propaganda leaflets on the city of Mosul to undermine support for Islamic State and its recruiting efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Coalition strikes have hit 73 tanks, some of them U.S.-made Iraqi M1A1 Abrams tanks seized when Islamic State militants overran northwestern parts Iraq last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They also destroyed 282 Humvee vehicles that had been taken from Iraqi forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The strikes targeted 408 Islamic State staging areas, 1,003 fighting positions and 87 oil collection points, Warren said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>An air strike can involve multiple weapons against multiple targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The tally covered air strikes conducted between Aug. 8, 2014, and March 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Pentagon has said that as a result of the strikes oil sales are no longer the primary source of revenue for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As of March 12, the Pentagon had spent about $1.83 billion on the strikes, an average of about $8.5 million daily, Warren said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Warren confirmed that around March 16 coalition forces had destroyed a drone operated by a militant near the Iraqi city of Fallujah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>U.S. forces believed the device was essentially a model aircraft that would have been commercially available to anyone, Warren said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The drone was not shot down. We observed it flying for approximately 20 minutes. We observed it land. We observed the enemy place the drone in the trunk of a car and we struck the car, destroying both the vehicle and the model airplane in the trunk," Warren said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said it was unclear how the pilot had been using the drone or if it was carrying devices such as a camera to conduct reconnaissance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"To my knowledge this is the first time we've observed ISIL using these types of equipment," Warren said, using an acronym for the group.</td></tr>
