<h3>US clears officer in Ferguson case, criticizes police force</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Federal officials concluded there was no evidence to disprove Wilson's testimony that he feared for his safety, nor was there reliable evidence that Michael Brown had his hands up when he was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The decision in the August 9 shooting had been expected, in part because of the high legal standard needed for a federal civil rights prosecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wilson, who has said Brown struck him in the face and reached for his gun during a tussle, also had been cleared by a Missouri grand jury in November and later resigned from the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The grand jury decision prompted street protests that turned violent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Federal officials concluded there was no evidence to disprove testimony by Wilson's, that he feared for his safety, nor was there reliable evidence that Michael Brown had his hands up in surrender when he was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A separate report said blacks in Ferguson are disproportionately subject to excessive police force, baseless traffic stops and citations for infractions as petty as walking down the middle of the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Justice Department issued more than two dozen recommendations to improve the closely aligned police department and court system, including training officers to de-escalate confrontations and better oversight of its recruiting, hiring and promotion procedures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Federal officials described Ferguson city leaders as cooperative and open to change, and said there were already signs of improvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Similarly broad federal civil rights investigations of troubled police departments have led to the appointment of independent monitors and mandated overhauls in the most fundamental of police practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Justice Department maintains the right to sue a police department if officials balk at making changes, though many investigations resolve the issue with both sides negotiating a blueprint for change known as a consent decree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's quite evident that change is coming down the pike. This is encouraging," said John Gaskin III, a St. Louis community activist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's so unfortunate that Michael Brown had to be killed. But in spite of that, I feel justice is coming."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Others said the federal government's findings confirmed what they had long known and should lead to change in the police department leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The findings of the investigation, which began weeks after Brown's killing last August, were released as Attorney General Eric Holder prepares to leave his job following a six-year tenure that focused largely on civil rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The report is based on interviews with police leaders and residents, a review of more than 35,000 pages of police records and analysis of data on stops, searches and arrests.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>All the surveys indicated Netanyahu had more potential political allies with whom to build a new governing coalition after the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Israel's parliamentary election system, the public chooses parties rather than individual candidates, and the head of the party with the most political allies is the one who usually wins a presidential mandate to form a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Israeli critics said that Netanyahu, seeking a fourth term in office, risked damaging Israel's strategic alliance with Washington by speaking in the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, for the sake of wooing voters before the closely contested election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Netanyahu came under strong criticism from the Obama administration for his speech, which Washington said had injected destructive partisanship into U.S.-Israeli ties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Republicans, who control Congress, had invited Netanyahu to speak without consulting President Barack Obama or other leading Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As many as 60 of the 232 Democratic members of Congress boycotted the address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Netanyahu rejected Obama's charges that his speech had offered "no viable alternatives" to an international deal being worked out with Tehran, saying he had presented a practical alternative in Washington to a "deeply flawed" nuclear accord being negotiated with Iran.</td></tr>
