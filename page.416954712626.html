<tr><td>18</td><td>A large part of population could not be reached easily as roads have been damaged by the earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Some are even difficult to reach by helicopter. We are facing monumental challenge here to support the government in these districts to have credible response," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Meanwhile, a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter carrying six Marines and two Nepalese soldiers was reported missing while delivering disaster aid Tuesday in the country's northeast, U.S. officials said, although there have been no indications the aircraft crashed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>30</td><td>The U.S. Geological Survey said Tuesday's earthquake was the largest aftershock of that quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But while the recent quake was terrifying and deadly, it was significantly less powerful than April's and occurred deeper in the Earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Working from U.S. Geological Survey data, calculations done by University of Michigan earthquake geophysicist Eric Hetland indicated that about 65,000 people were exposed to "violent" shaking Tuesday - compared to 1.5 million on April 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>While the first quake exposed just under 8,000 square kilometers (3,100 square miles) to severe shaking, Tuesday's exposed only about 660 square kilometers (255 square miles) to the same intensity, he said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>35</td><td>"That's really the key difference, in terms of how the earthquake affects people," Hetland said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The first quake also drove many people to leave damaged homes, which were empty when Tuesday quake caused more damage and collapses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Impoverished Nepal appealed for billions of dollars in foreign aid after the first quake, as well as medical experts to treat the wounded and helicopters to ferry food and temporary shelters to hundreds of thousands left homeless amid unseasonal rains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>On Wednesday, McGoldrick said the U.N. has revised its appeal to international donors to provide $423 million as against $415 million sought earlier for relief work to last three months given the magnitude of the task.</td></tr>
