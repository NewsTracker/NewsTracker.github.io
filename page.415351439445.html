<h3>Bali nine executions: Indonesian minister threatens to release 'human tsunami' of asylum seekers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Indonesia could release 10,000 asylum seekers to Australia if Canberra continues to antagonise the republic over the execution of the Bali nine duo, an Indonesian minister has warned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This would create a "human tsunami", according to the Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The former Navy chief, who is a controversial political figure in Indonesia, said Australia was trying to pressure Indonesia into cancelling the executions by raising the issue of its $1 billion in Boxing Day tsunami aid and discouraging visitors to Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He reminded Australia that Jakarta had been working hard to prevent asylum seekers attempting to travel to Australia in boats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If Canberra keeps doing things that displease Indonesia, Jakarta will surely let the illegal immigrants go to Australia," Mr Tedjo said on Metro TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"There are more than 10,000 [asylum seekers] in Indonesia today. If they are let go to Australia, it will be like a human tsunami."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Tedjo has previously supported isolating the 10,500 refugees and asylum seekers on a remote island in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The chief security minister said it was "no big deal" if Australia stopped trading with Indonesia in the wake of the execution of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We have calculated, in fact, Australia enjoys the surplus on the Indonesia-Australia trade," Mr Tedjo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Australia will in fact receive pressure domestically if it stops its livestock exports to Indonesia since Indonesia is Australia's main market."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Tedjo, who was delivering a speech on nationhood at the School of Law at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, said Australia needed to respect the Indonesian judicial system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said a prisoner swap, which was proposed by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in a last-ditch attempt to save the lives of Chan and Sukumaran, was "unethical".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We respect other countries' legal systems, Australia must learn about ethics here in University of Gadjah Mada," Mr Tedjo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Tedjo recommended the appointment of graft suspect Budi Gunawan as national police chief and outraged many in January when he lashed out at supporters of the popular and widely trusted Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In December, Mr Tedjo also provoked anger when he suggested unresolved human rights cases were things of the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Views are divided on capital punishment within government ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>MP Prananda Surya Paloh, who is a member of the same party in the ruling coalition as Mr Tedjo, said the government should have seen the positive side of the Bali nine pair in jail, according to news website Okezone.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"With regard to the execution of Bali nine duo Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, I, Prananda Surya Paloh, would like to say that today is a very sad day with regard to humanity," he wrote on his website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Prananda, whose father is media mogul Surya Paloh, the chairman of Nasdem Party, tweeted that replacing the death penalty with another form of punishment was not a sign of weakness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Meanwhile, Indonesian demonstrators took five bags of coins to the Australian embassy to 'repay' Australian aid after the 2004 tsunami and warned they would bring their government down if the Bali nine executions were cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The coins were not accepted by the embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Fairfax Media understands the police have been given the names of several charities to which the coins could be donated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The noisy but small protest was part of the #coinforAustralia campaign that was launched after Tony Abbott asked Indonesia to reciprocate for the $1billion in aid money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Prime Minister's comments caused widespread offence across Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>About 20 protesters, some of whom were from a Muslim students' organisation called PII, called on Tony Abbott "aka the big mouth" to apologise to the Indonesian people.</td></tr>

<h3>12 rich companies can afford to pay you more</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Investors love to see companies deliver massive profit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But they want their piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There's a group of mega-profitable companies that could easily afford to kick up their dividends - especially coming off a banner year for profit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There are 12 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500, including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Google and gadget maker Apple, that are paying dividends that are well below their means or not at all, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>To make this list, these companies' dividends over the past 12 months must be less than 30% of their net income during the period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If a company earned $100, that means it's paying $30 or less to investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That's an extraordinarily low payout ratio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Profitable companies in the S&P 500 have an average payout ratio of 50% over the past twelve months, S&P Capital IQ says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And that payout ratio is 60%, on average, among the companies that pay a dividend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Expect dividends to become even more important with investors as companies continue to let billions of cash pile up on their balance sheets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Investors would much rather get their hands on this cash than allow companies to squander capital chasing acquisitions that might have disappointing returns or let cash sit on their balance sheets collecting rock-bottom interest rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>When it comes to a profit giant that could easily afford to increase dividend payments to investors it's Berkshire Hathaway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The diversified investment company is a cash-flow machine, using the cash thrown off by its insurance and rail operations to fund other businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the company pays absolutely no dividend, despite generating net income of $19.9 billion in the past twelve months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Warren Buffett himself has huge holdings in companies that pay large dividends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Coca-Cola, for instance, paid out a dividend that was equal to 75% of its net income the past 12 months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But Berkshire itself pays zilch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Granted, investors will give Berkshire a pass since the stock does so well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The value of Berkshire just passed Exxon Mobil as the second most valuable U.S. stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It's not just Buffett, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tech has several examples of companies hauling in profit - that pay shockingly low dividends or none at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Google continues to be an example of a company that investors keep clamoring to pay more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The company is the second most profitable company, after Berkshire, that pays no dividend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>If Google finally heeds investors, and starts to return cash to investors, that could be "the biggest driver of upside for shares but no announcement is imminent," according to a report by UBS analyst Eric Sheridan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Yahoo may not pay a dividend, but it is at least attempting to address the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Web portal announced plans to spinoff its Alibaba Group stock to investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>There are yet other techs that pay dividends, but that are curiously low compared to their profit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Take database king Oracle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The company is currently sporting a dividend yield of 1.1%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But that means it's only paying out just shy of 20% of its net income the past 12 months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>And of course there's Apple, which pays a below the market dividend yield of 1.5%, despite being the most profitable company known to man and sitting on cash and investments of $178 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Apple can afford to do better than that, and at least one analyst has speculated a dividend boost might be coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Not all companies are as free to bump up their dividends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Several banks are on the list, and they must face strict regulatory requirements before increasing their payouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Still, we'll see how long investors will quietly accept their puny dividends as these companies haul in huge profits.</td></tr>
