<h3>Ukraine rebels disavow ceasefire at encircled town</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Guns fell abruptly silent at midnight across much of eastern Ukraine in line with the ceasefire agreement, reached after a week of diplomacy led by France and Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But pro-Russian rebels announced they would not observe the truce at Debaltseve, where Ukrainian army forces were encircled and Kiev military said rebel attacks on the town steadily increased from mid-afternoon on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Of course we can open fire (on Debaltseve). It is our territory," senior rebel commander Eduard Basurin told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The territory is internal: ours. And internal is internal. But along the line of confrontation there is no shooting."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A statement by the Kiev military on Sunday night said the "enemy" was carrying out attacks with varied types of weapons, including Grad rocket systems, and had a plan to try to seize Debaltseve from the west.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a four-way telephone conversation with the leaders of Germany, France and Russia's Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said the position of the four at peace talks last week in Belarus had been for a ceasefire on all the front lines including at Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Poroshenko stressed that a withdrawal of military equipment and heavy weapons required a "full and unconditional" ceasefire under the Minsk agreement, his press service said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, responsible for monitoring the ceasefire, said rebels had denied its observers access to Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both sides blamed what firing there was on the enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Debaltseve has been the focus of fighting for weeks, and it will be hard to speak of a truce if Ukrainian troops remain trapped there under fire, or the rebels press on with their advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday's peace deal including the truce must be implemented "unconditionally".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But he made no mention of whether Moscow believed the truce applied to Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ukrainian forces have been holding out for weeks in the town, which sits astride a railway junction in a pocket between the two main rebel strongholds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rebels say they have completely encircled the town, but Ukraine says its forces have kept open a road to resupply it in the face of a Russian-backed onslaught.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Washington says regular Russian forces armed with tanks and missile launchers advanced on the town from all sides in the days before the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Reuters journalists operating on the rebel side have seen armored columns of troops without insignia arriving in the area in recent days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the main rebel center, Donetsk, Reuters journalists said artillery had been exploding every few seconds in the hours before the ceasefire, but halted abruptly at midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A Ukrainian military spokesman said the ceasefire was being "generally observed".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Its forces had been shelled 10 times since the truce took effect in localized incidents, and no soldiers had been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Poroshenko, wearing the uniform of the armed forces' supreme commander, announced the order to stop firing in a midnight televised address, but said there was still alarm over Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I very much hope that the last chance to begin the long and difficult peaceful process for a political settlement will not be wasted," he said, adding, however, that if Ukraine were slapped, it would not "turn the other cheek".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The ceasefire, negotiated in all-night four-power talks on Thursday, foresees creation of a buffer zone and withdrawal of heavy weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>More than 5,000 people have been killed in a conflict that has caused the worst crisis in Russia-West relations since the Cold War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Putin denies Moscow is involved in fighting for territory that he calls "New Russia" but Washington and its allies have imposed economic sanctions over Russia's role in the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The United Nations was still negotiating a Russian-drafted resolution that would welcome the ceasefire agreement and call on all parties to implement it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We're not in a position to vote a text today," Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told reporters on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Malaysian U.N. Ambassador Hussein Haniff said he wanted the draft to reflect a resolution adopted in July, which demanded access to the eastern Ukraine site where a Malaysian passenger plane crashed with 298 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Maxim, a rebel fighter at a checkpoint on a road from Donetsk to government-held Dnipropetrovsk, said he did not expect the ceasefire to hold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Truce? I doubt it. Maybe two to three days, and then they will start shooting again. This is all for show. The OSCE is driving around here, so of course they are being quiet."</td></tr>

<h3>F.A.A. Rules Would Limit Commercial Drone Use</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The rules, though less restrictive than the current ones, appear to prohibit for now the kind of drone delivery services being explored by Amazon, Google and other companies, since the operator or assigned observers must be able to see the drone at all times without binoculars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But company officials believe the line-of-sight requirement could be relaxed in the future to accommodate delivery services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The proposed regulations would cover only nonrecreational unmanned aircraft weighing up to 55 pounds, and would not apply to the recreational use of drones, which have become hugely popular with hobbyists and are covered by other rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, the F.A.A. said it was considering additional rules to cover some uses of the smallest drones, so-called microdrones, weighing less than 4.4 pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some drone evangelists believe that in the next few decades, robotic aircraft will prove as useful and transformative to government, commerce and home life as the personal computer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the exploding number of domestic drones has been accompanied by increasing safety problems, including reports of near misses involving passenger airliners and the crash of a small drone on the White House grounds last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The F.A.A. has worked on the rules for several years, and their release only begins a period of public comment and possible revision that could take as long as two years before they take effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We have tried to be flexible in writing these rules," Michael P. Huerta, the F.A.A. administrator, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We want to maintain today's outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Also on Sunday, President Obama signed a memorandum requiring government agencies to report publicly each year a "general summary" on their drone use, though the order includes a loophole allowing secrecy for operations involving national security or law enforcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The memorandum addresses worries that drone surveillance could invade privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It requires agencies to adopt rules governing "the collection, use, retention, and dissemination of information obtained by UAS," or unmanned aerial systems, and making sure their drone use complies with the law and the Constitution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The draft rules and the presidential order reflect growing official concern about the dangers posed by the unregulated proliferation of drones in many industries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After a decade in which unmanned aircraft were mainly associated with spying and killing terrorists, small drones in the last few years have been adopted by real estate agents to photograph properties, farmers to survey crops and electric utilities to inspect power lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hobbyists, who can buy a microdrone for less than $1,000, now use them to film everything from fireworks displays to football games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Amazon, the Seattle-based online retailer, complained that the proposed rules might slow the development of its proposed delivery service, Prime Air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Paul Misener, Amazon's vice president for global public policy, said the proposed rules could take one or two years for final adoption and would not permit Prime Air to operate in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The F.A.A. needs to begin and expeditiously complete the formal process to address the needs of our business, and ultimately our customers," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr. Misener suggested that the company might launch its delivery service first in other countries with more accommodating rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We are committed to realizing our vision for Prime Air and are prepared to deploy where we have the regulatory support we need," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ryan Calo, an assistant professor of law at the University of Washington, said the rules would allow many of the uses of drones that people in the commercial sector wanted, including for agriculture, which is thought to be one of the biggest markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Farmers have shown interest in using drones for crop disease detection from the air and more targeted spraying of pesticides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mr. Calo said the rules might be revised to allow the development of delivery businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"They could change, especially if someone shows autonomous flight modes can be safe," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The draft F.A.A. rules were received with relief by some commercial users who had been alarmed by earlier news reports that the agency might require commercial drone operators to have a pilot's license.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Instead, operators would have to pass a test to get a permit, and renew it every two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The agency estimates that it would cost $300 to become certified, including fees and preparation costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Commercial drones would be allowed to fly no faster than 100 miles an hour and no higher than 500 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In most cases, they could not fly over people other than the operators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Aerospace Industries Association welcomed the proposed rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The trade group's president, Marion C. Blakey, said the rules would "pave the way for additional service organizations and industries to explore expanded operations" using drones.</td></tr>
