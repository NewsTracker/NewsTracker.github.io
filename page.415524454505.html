<h3>American culture still intrigues Carlos Castro</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WOODBRIDGE, Va.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>-- Carlos Castro was 25 years old when he fled civil war in his native El Salvador in 1979 and entered the U.S. illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He was caught and deported, but entered again the following year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After a brief stint in California, he headed east to Washington, D.C., where he toiled as a factory worker, a janitor, a restaurant dishwasher and bus boy, and a Realtor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In 1990, he achieved his dream: he became a U.S. citizen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That same year, he opened Todos Supermarket in the Washington D.C. suburb of Woodbridge, Va.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>to cater to the area's growing number of Latinos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Today, the 60-year-old entrepreneur oversees a multi-million dollar business with two area supermarkets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An advocate for Latino empowerment, he became particularly vocal in the late 2000s after Prince William County, where he lives and works, passed stricter and more discriminatory rules against illegal immigrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When did you first become aware of your race?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was when I first came to the U.S. that I saw the big difference, in customs and habits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's not like in El Salvador where we are all Latino.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Here you could see the differences in everything, not just the difference in how we conduct ourselves but also how we eat, drink or even how we have fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But I'd always been intrigued by the American culture, even when I was in high school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I loved history and was always reading books written by Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>What has been your best experience and/or worst experience with someone of another race?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I will tell you about my best experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>I had a friend, an older white American woman, who lent me money so I could get out of debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That was eye-opening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When I first opened the grocery store, I also worked as a Realtor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>I was the rookie in the office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>My co-worker, she was 30 years older than me and one day asks, 'What's wrong Carlos?' I tell her nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But she jokes and tells me they call me Sunshine in the office because I'm always smiling and happy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Recently, she said, I hadn't been.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I tell her I'm in deep debt because of the store, $20,000 in debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>And do you know, she writes me a check for $20,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>How did your experience of race change you?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Hispanics, we sometimes have a short fuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>We might explode over the smallest things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But American culture isn't like that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>And that's been a great influence on me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It's helped me learn to analyze situations more, to talk more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>How are your feelings about people of different races, and your experiences with them, different from those of your parents?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>My parents don't really see race differences, but they did not come to this country to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>I brought them here when they were older to take care of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>They always felt so privileged to be here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>My father has passed away, but he always regretted not learning to speak English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>What has been your generation's biggest challenge as it pertains to race?</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>There is a certain feeling of relief or satisfaction that my generation has opened doors for younger generations of Latinos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>We were stuck with the hardships and discrimination and our children, they don't see any of the racial differences among themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>They don't see black or Chinese or any of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>What do we need to do, as a country and as individuals, to move past race as a way to divide and define us?</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>We all have strong feelings about our race, but we also are all human beings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>As for Latinos, there are two barriers, in my opinion, that we need to get over to become part of this country, language and assimilation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Hispanics tend to stay separate from the day-to-day life in the U.S. I'm not saying forget our culture, but it is important to understand the culture here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>We have to get to know Americans here and the way of life here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>For example, he says, it's damaging when we do not participate in our children's education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>You go to a parent-teacher conference and you don't see a lot of Or voting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Voting gives you power in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>That's the fastest way to ensure that politicians see that we are serious.</td></tr>

<h3>SXSW 2015: Snoop Dogg, Sam Hunt aim to stand out in a crowded music field</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>What exactly are these artists seeking at SXSW, which began in 1987 as a kind of low-key regional expo?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The short answer, of course, is buzz - the precious bit of noise needed to stand out in an increasingly crowded field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yet the specifics vary from striver to striver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Here's a look into the minds of some of them as they head to Austin with things to do and people to impress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After two acclaimed indie albums, the L.A.-based guitar-pop group is readying its first major-label record, "California Nights," for release in early May. So although SXSW is familiar territory for Best Coast, which made a splash at the festival as a so-called baby band in 2010, the group is playing higher-profile gigs this year (including a Universal Music Group showcase and a party sponsored by Rolling Stone) that seem intended to boost the act's standing from the underground to the alt-rock A-list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Here's another local with product to push: Also due in May, "Bush" will be Snoop Dogg's debut for Columbia Records, which paired the veteran rapper with producer Pharrell Williams for a set likely to emphasize Snoop's drunk-uncle charm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Instead of heading to SXSW as a performer, though, the 43-year-old Long Beach native is scheduled to deliver the festival's keynote address, a task handled in recent years by Lady Gaga, who used the occasion to defend her polarizing "Artpop" album, and Dave Grohl, who went warm-and-fuzzy rhapsodizing about the value of inspiration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>What will this year's talk entail?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Only the Doggfather knows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The adventurous country star just scored his second No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>1 country hit with "Take Your Time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But with a live show that has him covering Destiny's Child and Mariah Carey - not to mention an album that keeps hanging around the upper reaches of the iTunes chart - Hunt appears to have his sights set beyond Nashville domination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>SXSW provides an opportunity to put his shape-shifting music in front of noncountry audiences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This Swedish singer hasn't had any trouble reaching audiences: Her song "Habits (Stay High)," about going to "sex clubs" and "watching freaky people getting it on," peaked at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>3 on Billboard's Hot 100, reflecting sales of more than 3 million copies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>What Tove Lo hasn't quite done is attach her music to a recognizable presence, a la other wild-child Hot 100 habitues like Kesha and Rihanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That may change in Austin, where you can bet she'll work hard to live up to the flamboyant streak in her lyrics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>SXSW still has room for newcomers without any hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>See Summer Moon, a New York-based band so fresh it hasn't released a single tune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Then again, "newcomers" might not be the right word for a foursome that features Nikolai Fraiture of the Strokes and Tennessee Thomas of the Like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Here they'll try to put some songs behind that semi-supergroup status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>This young singer-songwriter also boasts an impressive pedigree: Last year, she toured as a member of Jenny Lewis' road band, a job held previously by such indie-rock success stories as Danielle Haim of Haim and Barbara Gruska of the Belle Brigade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Now Prass is playing SXSW behind her own self-titled debut, which has already won rave reviews for its crafty blend of classic country-pop melodies and lush Old Hollywood arrangements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Can she bring its delicate sound to life in a place well known for devouring attention spans?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>With so many demands on attendees' ears, SXSW rewards savvy recyclers: artists who don't need long to get an idea across precisely because the idea is so familiar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A sharp-dressed soul man in the vein of Sam Cooke or Otis Redding, Bridges expertly revives '60s-style R&B in the handful of tunes he's released from his coming major-label debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Adele fans tired of waiting for her new album will be ripe for his picking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>What would a major music event be without Kanye West?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The human lightning rod, who last year took part in a Samsung-sponsored throw-down with Jay Z, hadn't confirmed by late Tuesday that he'd be playing a full-on concert at SXSW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But he's scheduled to appear Friday on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," which is taping all week at Austin's Long Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Do you really think the guy would schlep all the way to Texas just for that?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>We're at South by Southwest until March 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Join us at latimes.com/sxsw for ongoing coverage of the festival.</td></tr>
