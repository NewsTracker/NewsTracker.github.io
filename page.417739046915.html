<h3>Egypt opens borders with Gaza for the first time in months</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) - Egypt opened its borders with the Gaza Strip for the first time in months Saturday, allowing Palestinians to enter and leave the isolated coastal strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Rafah border crossing will operate for six hours a day for the coming three days and 15,000 people Palestinians have applied to exit to Egypt, said Maher Abu Sabha, head of the Gaza side of the crossing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said those were humanitarian cases and included medical patients, students and Arab residents whose residency permits were about to expire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, he said only 1,500 of those were actually expected to pass through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rafah is Gaza's only gateway to the outside world with no Israeli control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Egypt has kept it mostly closed since the militant Hamas group seized control of the coastal strip in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The closure worsened after Egypt's military ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood member, in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hamas is an offshoot of the Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Egypt has opened the Rafah crossing in both directions only five days this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Last month, it allowed the return of Palestinians stranded in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Outside the crossing, hundreds of Palestinians struggled for a chance to ride one of the buses that would go inside the crossing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One hopeful traveler, Khaled Abu Okal, 27, was a doctoral student at a university in Malaysia who came to visit his family after last summer's war and has been unable to leave since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If I cannot make it through this time, I will lose just another (academic) year," Okal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I already lost one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Outside the hall, a woman and her children sat in the dirt with tears in their eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mother Youssra Abu Qouta said she wants to take her two daughters, ages 9 and 11, for treatment in an Egyptian hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I come here every time the crossing opens, but no luck," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We are thrown here like dogs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The opening of the crossing is seen as a humanitarian gesture by Egypt ahead of the Muslim's holy fasting month of Ramadan.</td></tr>
