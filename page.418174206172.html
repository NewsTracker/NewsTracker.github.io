<h3>Eurogroup refuses Greece bailout extension, talks to continue</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS: Eurozone finance ministers declined to extend Greece's bailout on Tuesday just hours before its expiry and a possible IMF default, but talks will continue on Wednesday after Athens asked for a new aid plan, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Last deadline for Greece program extension was weekend. Due to parliamentary procedures, unable to extend program beyond today," Slovakia's Finance Minister Peter Kazimir wrote on Twitter following a conference call to discuss the last-minute proposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Finnish Finance Minister Alex Stubb said an extension was "not possible" and said a request for a new rescue programme with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the EU's bailout vehicle, "is always dealt with through normal procedures."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A Greek government source said the talks had concluded for the day and were set to resume Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The Eurogroup just finished. We will continue tomorrow morning to allow finance ministers to examine the proposals of the Greek government," the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had requested a two-year rescue deal with the European Union to save the crisis-hit country, just hours before its international bailout expires later Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tsipras also requested a short extension to its current bailout programme to avoid a "technical default," with a 1.5 billion euro payment due to the IMF in just hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Eurogroup had previously rejected Greece's request for an extension to its bailout following the Greek government's announcement of a referendum on Sunday on reform demands by Athens' creditors.</td></tr>
