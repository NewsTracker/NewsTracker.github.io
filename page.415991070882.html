<h3>Kennedy, Upton lead Padres to 8-0 rout of Mexico City</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Padres, who added five star position players and ace James Shields in a dramatic winter makeover, open the season Monday at Dodger Stadium against Clayton Kershaw, who won the NL MVP and Cy Young Award last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kennedy (2-1) allowed only a walk while striking out three in three innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Red Devils didn't get their first hit until Emmanuel Avila singled to right off Brandon Maurer in the fifth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mexico City committed three errors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kemp hit a bases-loaded infield single in the third and Upton followed with a two-run double.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Will Middlebrooks, another newcomer, hit a sacrifice fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kemp had another RBI single in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Wil Myers, the new center fielder, singled twice and had a nice defensive play in the fourth, when he made a diving catch of Japhet Amador's line drive and doubled Ivan Terrazas off first to end the inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Red Devils: LHP Alberto Castillo allowed five runs and five hits in three-plus innings, walked four and struck out three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Padres: Kennedy got in his final tuneup before his next scheduled start, in the home opener Thursday against San Francisco.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Gwynn, who died on June 16, finished his Hall of Fame career with 3,141 hits, all in a Padres uniform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Padres unveiled their new HD video board in left field, which they say is the biggest in the NL and the third-biggest in MLB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Costing between $10 million and $12 million, it is 61 feet tall and 124 feet wide, nearly five times as big as the original video screen at Petco Park, which opened in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Shields gets the start against Kershaw and the Dodgers on Monday afternoon.</td></tr>
