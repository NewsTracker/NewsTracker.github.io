<h3>Greece grants nationality to 2nd generation immigrants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece has adopted legislation granting nationality to the children of foreign nationals living in the country, provided they attend or have attended school in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lawmakers approved the draft legislation Thursday, in a vote that marked a rift in the country's governing coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The minority partner, the populist right wing Independent Greeks party, rejected the bill that was submitted by the radical left Syriza party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the legislation was approved with the support of center-left opposition parties, while the conservative main opposition and the Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn party - Greece's third-largest - voted against.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new law is expected to affect up to 200,000 second-generation immigrants, many of whose parents arrived in Greece during a big migratory flow from eastern Europe since the early 1990s.</td></tr>
