<tr><td>35</td><td>Hannington Alatoa, head of the Vanuatu Red Cross Society, said flyovers by New Zealand and Australian relief teams showed much of the country had been "flattened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>At least half of the population, or about 130,000 people, has been affected, Alatoa said in Sendai.</td></tr>

<tr><td>42</td><td>The small island nation, located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, has repeatedly warned it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing resettlement to higher ground and smaller yields on traditional crops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Scientists say it's impossible to attribute single weather events like Cyclone Pam to climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"Climate change is contributing to the disasters in Vanuatu," President Lonsdale said.</td></tr>
