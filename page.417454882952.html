<h3>Temporary houses for NT cyclone victims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Almost four months after Cyclone Lam destroyed homes in Galiwinku community on the NT's Elcho Island, families have been moved into the first lot of temporary transportable houses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cyclone Lam hit on February 20 as a category four storm, followed a month later by category three Cyclone Nathan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There were no serious injuries or deaths, but over 300 people were displaced with around 200 people living in a tent city while waiting for more permanent accommodation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>More than 80 houses in Galiwinku were severely damaged and Chief Minister Adam Giles said in a statement it will take many months to rebuild them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"These transportable houses ensure these residents will have suitable, comfortable accommodation until they can move back into their homes," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The accommodation is being progressively installed around the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Each one is made up of two transportable buildings joined by a covered breezeway, providing accommodation for around ten people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Housing Minister Bess Price says they were designed in consultation with Elcho Island community leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Giles said last month's NT budget included $90 million for recovery and rebuilding work but the total cost across four communities is expected to tip $100 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said the government was working with community leaders in Galiwinku, Ramingining, Milingimbi and Gapuwiyak to create jobs, training and business development opportunities through the rebuilding process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The first phase of the rebuilding program involves repairing half of the most damaged houses to get most seriously affected families back into permanent accommodation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This will be followed by a longer-term three to four year training and jobs program so community members can make the most of the twin disasters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The last of the transportable homes are expected to be installed by the end of June.</td></tr>
