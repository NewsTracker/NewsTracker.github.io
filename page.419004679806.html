<h3>Egypt postpones Al Jazeera retrial verdict to Aug. 29</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police and army soldiers are seen in front of a tank as they guard outside Tora prison, where Al Jazeera television journalists Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were held and are having their retrial, in Cairo, Egypt, July 30, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CAIRO An Egyptian court on Sunday postponed delivering its verdict in the retrial of three Al Jazeera TV journalists, a decision a defense lawyer said was to avoid bad publicity during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other dignitaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the second time the verdict in the internationally sensitive case has been postponed, this time to Aug. 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The three men were originally sentenced to between seven and 10 years in prison on charges including spreading lies to help a terrorist organization, a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The journalists deny the charges and Egypt's high court ordered a retrial in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mohamed Fahmy, a naturalized Canadian who has given up his Egyptian citizenship, and Egyptian Baher Mohamed were released on bail in February after more than a year in custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Australian Peter Greste, was deported in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Amal Clooney, one of Fahmy's lawyers, said the adjournment appeared aimed to avoid clashing with Kerry's visit to Cairo on Sunday as well as a lavish inauguration planned on Thursday for a second Suez Canal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The verdict may be coming later; but the world will still be watching," Clooney said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri said during a news conference with Kerry that no journalists in Egypt were in jail over their reporting.</td></tr>
