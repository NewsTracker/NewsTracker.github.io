<h3>Euro stocks rise on data, dollar rebounds</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (Reuters) - European stocks held near record highs on Tuesday on signs the euro zone economy was gaining momentum, while the dollar recovered from recent losses and oil fell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average (.DJI) fell 15.21 points, or 0.08 percent, to 18,100.83, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 1.38 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,103.04 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 7.74 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,018.71.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 (.FTEU3) index of top shares had steadied near a recent 7-1/2-year high at 1,605.27 after falling earlier in the session on Chinese economic data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The euro was higher earlier after a stronger-than-expected survey on euro zone manufacturing that showed factory business hitting a four-year high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Subsequent strong data in the United States, however, shifted sentiment in favour of the greenback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The euro (EUR=) was last down 0.25 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The dollar has been on a roll in the last 12 months, rising more than 20 percent against a basket of major currencies in expectation of higher U.S. interest rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Any positive surprises from the euro area are further adding to this euro/dollar rally; however we think this is temporary," said Nikolaos Sgouropoulos, foreign exchange strategist at Barclays in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We still believe in the dollar strength trend going into the second half of the year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Those gains have been tempered somewhat of late after the Federal Reserve cut its forecasts for U.S. inflation and growth, making investors reconsider when the Fed might start raising rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The dollar index (.DXY) was last up 0.2 percent at 97.231, below its 12-year peak of 100.390 struck on March 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Tuesday the strong dollar would drag on growth this year though the U.S. economy was strong enough to handle it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Bond yields fell as inflation remains low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Core U.S. consumer inflation is running at a 1.7 percent year-over-year rate and U.K. inflation was unchanged on an annual basis, the first time that has happened since record-keeping began in 1989.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were last up 3/32 in price, with yields falling to 1.90 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The China flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers Index dipped to 49.2 in March, below the 50 level separating expansion from contraction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 50.6, slightly weaker than February's 50.7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Chinese data weighed on oil prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Brent crude fell under $55 a barrel (LCOc1) as Saudi Arabia said its production was close to an all-time high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Japan's Nikkei stock average (.N225) slipped 0.2 percent, pulling away from the previous session's 15-year highs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In Japan, a similar manufacturing survey added to concerns that its slowly recovering economy may also be losing momentum, with activity expanding at a much slower clip as domestic orders contracted.</td></tr>
