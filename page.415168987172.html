<h3>Mourners pay respects to murdered Kremlin critic Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Aides to Putin deny any involvement in killing Nemtsov, who was shot in the back four times on Friday within sight of the Kremlin walls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nemtsov's friends say he was the victim of an atmosphere of hatred whipped up against anyone who opposes the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The shots were fired not only at Nemtsov but at all of us, at democracy in Russia," Gennady Gudkov, a prominent Kremlin opponent, said in a speech delivered next to the coffin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in Russia during Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Most of those paying their respects were members or sympathisers of Russia's liberal opposition, who feel deep alarm at Nemtsov's shooting but represent only a minority of the Russian population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Polls show most Russians support Putin, despite a sharp slide in the rouble and international sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But at the ceremony there was a show of solidarity for Nemtsov from several prominent figures who served with him under former President Boris Yeltsin and who still have influence within the business and political elite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>None of them criticised the Kremlin but their presence - led by Yeltsin's widow Naina - showed that there are faultlines within the system of power built by Putin which could deepen if that system comes under more stress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Two European dignitaries were unable to attend the ceremony because Russian officials would not let them into the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Moscow said one of them, a former Latvian foreign minister, had for some time been subject to a travel ban for her "anti-Russian activities".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Absent also was Alexei Navalny, a prominent Kremlin critic serving a 15-day jail term for violating rules on demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said a court rejected his request to let him out of jail for a few hours so he could attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For four hours, Nemtsov's coffin stood in the centre of a hall at a human rights centre named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The casket lid was open, revealing Nemtsov's head and upper body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Photographs of the 55-year-old hung on the walls, and sombre music played.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nemtsov's mother, dressed in black, stood stooped over the coffin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>His former partner Yekaterina Odintsova, with a black headscarf pulled over her blonde hair, stood nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Russian government sent two deputy prime ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The queue of people waiting to go in stretched about a kilometre (half a mile) in the streets outside the hall, and hundreds had to be turned away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"He was our hope," said Tatyana, a pensioner queuing to pay her respects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I feel like Putin killed me on the day he died. This last year has been full of suffering."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Nemtsov was later buried at the Troyekurovskoye cemetery, on the outskirts of Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Anna Politkovskaya, an investigative journalist and Kremlin opponent shot dead in 2006, is buried at the same cemetery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Though he became an ardent Putin critic, Nemtsov also maintained friendships with people from the Yeltsin era who remained loyal to the Kremlin under Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Among those Yelstin-era allies paying their respects were German Gref, head of Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank by assets, Alexei Kudrin, a former finance minister still close to the Kremlin, Anatoly Chubais, head of a state-controlled technology firm, and Sergei Kiriyenko, a former prime minister who runs the state atomic power firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It has long been rumoured in Moscow that when Yeltsin stepped down in 1999 he extracted a promise from Putin that his circle would be protected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The killing of Nemtsov, whom Yeltsin at one point groomed as a successor, may be seen by some in the old Yeltsin milieu as a betrayal of a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The killing of such a prominent former official, against the backdrop of the Kremlin towers themselves in an area closely watched by the security services, sent a chilling message that no status confers immunity and no place in Russia is safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In an interview with Reuters in Washington, President Barack Obama said it was a sign of a worsening climate in Russia, where civil rights and media freedoms have been rolled back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Among numerous official theories, some Russian government officials have said they suspect the murder was a "provocation" carried out by Putin's opponents to discredit him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Russian investigators say they are actively working to track down Nemtsov's killers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The killing may galvanise Russia's splintered liberal opposition, and deepen a sense among urban, middle-class professionals that their country is slipping into a cycle of fear and repression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But it is unlikely to cause an upsurge of dissent across society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Nemtsov's fierce criticism of the Russian intervention in Ukraine was out of step with the broader public mood, and he was tainted by his time in government in the chaotic 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I don't think he was killed for political motives," said Andrei, an employee at a motorcycle shop near the venue where Nemtsov's coffin was displayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"He had a murky past and that's why he was killed."</td></tr>

<h3>A year on, what's the latest in the hunt for Flight MH370?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The current phase of the search in the deep, dark and desolate waters of the Indian Ocean has failed to yield a single clue about the plane's fate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>SYDNEY: Nearly a year has passed since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, sparking one of the most perplexing mysteries of modern times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Since then, search crews have taken to air, land and sea in a thus-far fruitless hunt for the plane and the 239 people who disappeared with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Still, despite the lack of fresh leads, the official heading up the search is no less optimistic than when it began.</td></tr>
