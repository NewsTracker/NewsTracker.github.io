<h3>Greece repays IMF loan instalment despite cash crunch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece's government has given the order to repay a roughly 450 million euro ($485-million) loan instalment to the International Monetary Fund due Thursday - a debt Athens had insisted it will honor despite being severely cash-strapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended 240 billion euros in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The order (for the repayment) has been given," and the payment was being processed and carried out, a Finance Ministry official said on condition of anonymity, in line with ministry regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Doubts about whether Athens could repay the loan had renewed fears the country might default and have to leave the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece's new left wing-led government has been locked in strained negotiations with creditors since winning elections in January on pledges to abolish the deeply resented budget austerity measures required by the rescue program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The country has not received any funds from its rescue loans since last August, and is running short of cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It hopes to persuade creditors to unfreeze the final 7.2 billion euro bailout installment, and is locked in negotiations over reforms it is proposing in return for the funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece is unable to tap the international bond market for funds due to sky-high borrowing rates that reflect a lack of confidence in the country being able to repay its debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It has been surviving on its rescue loans since mid-2010, and the new government won a four-month extension to the main, European part of its bailout in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Under the extension agreement, Athens must present a series of fiscal measures to reform its economy that meet the approval of its creditors at the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Authorities are hoping for a final agreement later this month, when finance ministers from eurozone countries meet on April 24 in Latvia.</td></tr>
