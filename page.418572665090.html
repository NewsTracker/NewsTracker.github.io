<h3>Islamic State claims rocket attack on Egypt navy vessel left ablaze after shootout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt's Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) affiliate said on Thursday it fired a rocket at an Egyptian naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea near the coast of Israel and the Gaza Strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Such incidents at sea are rare, though Egypt is battling an increasingly brazen Islamist insurgency in the peninsula that lies between Israel, the Gaza Strip and the Suez Canal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sinai Province, the most lethal militant group in Egypt, last year pledged loyalty to Isil, which controls large tracts of territory in Syria and Iraq and has a presence in Egypt's neighbour Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It has recently carried out high profile attacks which prompted the drafting of a sweeping counter-terrorism law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On July 1, 100 militants and at least 17 members of the security forces were killed in a single day of clashes and attacks claimed by Sinai Province, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A Reuters witness in Gaza saw a plume of dark grey smoke rising from a boat off the coast.</td></tr>
