<h3>Grizzlies take 2-0 series lead, beating Trail Blazers 97-82 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Known for pounding opponents inside with Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph, the Memphis Grizzlies are showing they can be just as effective outside the paint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hey, they can even shoot 3-pointers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mike Conley and Courtney Lee each scored 18 points, and the Grizzlies beat Portland 97-82 Wednesday night to grab the franchise's first 2-0 lead in a playoff series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Grizzlies took full advantage of starting the playoffs at home for only the second time in their short postseason history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They had only won their playoff opener once before, and that was on the road in San Antonio in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''All we did is just take care of home court, which we were supposed to do,'' Lee said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Gasol had 15 points, and Randolph and Beno Udrih added 10 apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>LaMarcus Aldridge led Portland with 24 points and 14 rebounds, and he also had four blocks with two steals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Damian Lillard added 18 points but the Trail Blazers lost their first two playoff games for the first time since 2011, when they fell in six games to Dallas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Game 3 in this best-of-seven series is Saturday night in Portland, and the Trail Blazers hope to draw on their fans the way the Grizzlies have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''We got to try to do something there,'' Lillard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Memphis is known for its bruising inside game with Gasol and Randolph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That duo combined to shoot 9 of 31, not that it mattered with Memphis shooting 50 percent (8 of 16) outside the arc and 42.7 percent overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''If they are going to keep giving us that, we're going to keep taking them,'' Gasol said of the outside shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Memphis was 22nd in the NBA shooting 3s this season while Portland ranked eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the Grizzlies shot 50.9 percent against the Trail Blazers sweeping all four games in the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>So the Grizzlies' 3-point accuracy didn't surprise Portland coach Terry Stotts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''They're good shooters,'' Stotts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''They don't look for them a lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Portland came into this series with several players banged-up, and the list got longer with center Chris Kaman out after spraining his left ankle Tuesday in practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Stotts juggled his lineup, starting guard Allen Crabbe for the first time in the postseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Blazers looked like the team that won 51 games during the regular season early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Crabbe hit a 3 in the opening minutes to give the Blazers their first lead in this series, and they jumped out to a 10-2 lead with Aldridge connecting on four of his first five shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Yet even with the Grizzlies shooting so poorly that they missed a handful of layups in the quarter, Portland led only 21-19 at the end of the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Memphis took control in the second with a 15-2 run, turning Portland's four-point edge to a 34-25 lead on a 3-pointer by Jeff Green.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Grizzlies outscored Portland 31-18 in the quarter and led 50-39 at halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Grizzlies simply clamped down tighter and led 73-60 at the end of the third after leading by as much as 18 late in the quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Trail Blazers: Portland's shooting woes continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Aldridge was 4 of 6 in the opening quarter and went 3 of 14 the rest of the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Lillard, 5 of 21 overall and 0 of 6 outside the arc in the opener, was 5 of 16 and hit 1 of 5 outside the arc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>... The Trail Blazers turned it over 14 times, which Memphis converted into 16 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Grizzlies: Memphis had 29 second-chance points on just 12 rebounds, a franchise record in the playoffs, topping the mark of 26 set in triple-overtime against Oklahoma City in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>... Lee made two 3-pointers, and Memphis now is 23-3 this season when he makes at least two in a game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>... Memphis had six turnovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Grizzlies guard Tony Allen started the first 36 games he played this season, then only five more the rest of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He said he was told Wednesday morning he would start again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>''And they told me not to tell y'all,'' Allen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''Why would we tell them?'' Gasol said when asked what lessons Portland could take from the Grizzlies, who overcame a 2-0 deficit against the Clippers in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Portland guard Arron Afflalo missed his fifth straight game with his own strained right shoulder, and reserve forward Dorell Wright remains out of this series with a broken left hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>... Udrih, who had 20 points in the opener, scored eight off the bench before spraining his right ankle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>He went to the locker room and got his ankle wrapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He returned late in the third quarter.</td></tr>
