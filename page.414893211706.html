<h3>US officials say a force of 25,000 soldiers needed to drive the Islamic State out of Mosul</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Islamic State fighter in Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON, DC - An Iraqi and Kurdish military force of some 20,000 to 25,000 troops is being prepared to recapture the city of Mosul from Islamic State fighters, probably in the April-May time frame, an official at the US Central Command said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The official said Mosul was now being held by 1,000 to 2,000 Islamic State fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No decision has been made on whether small numbers of US military advisers might need to be on the ground close to Mosul to direct close air support, the official told a group of reporters on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mosul, which had a population of over 1 million people, was captured by Islamic State fighters in June and is the largest city in the group's self-declared caliphate, a stretch of territory that straddles the border between northern Iraq and eastern Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The main attack force being assembled for the Mosul campaign would include five Iraqi army brigades, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Three smaller brigades would act as a reserve force, and three brigades of Kurdish peshmerga troops would contain the city from the north and isolate it from Islamic State forces further west.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A so-called Mosul fighting force consisting mainly of former Mosul police officers and tribal fighters also is being assembled for the assault, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>About a brigade of counterterrorism troops also would be employed in the fight, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The total number of troops would be 20,000 to 25,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The aim of Iraqi and US military leaders is to have all five Iraqi army brigades that comprise the main attack force participate in US-led training currently going on in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That will begin once the present batch of 3,200 trainees rotate out of the five training sites, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The official said the timing of the offensive would ultimately depend on the readiness of Iraqi forces, which collapsed last summer as Islamic State conquered Mosul, the country's second-largest city, and raced across northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is highly unusual for the US military to openly telegraph the timing of an upcoming offensive, especially to a large group of reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Asked why the exception was being made for the Mosul offensive, which the Pentagon has described as a pivotal battle in the overall campaign in Iraq, the official said it was a reflection of the confidence of Iraq, which had devised the battle plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They are absolutely committed to this. There are a lot of pieces that have to come together and we want to make sure the conditions are right. But this is their plan. They have bought into it. They are moving forward as if they will execute in the time frame that I just described," the official said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>At a press conference today, Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed and disgusted' by the way the man had been treated.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>'Chelsea should call my lawyer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And they haven't done that yet.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>Josh Parsons and his brother Benji were reported as having been sent letters by the football club in the weeks before the match against Paris Saint-Germain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The letters are not thought to have been connected to racism, the Guardian reports.</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>Josh Parsons went to the 30,000-a-year school and a picture posted online shows him posed with Mr Farage outside a pub in central London with the caption: 'Ukip boys!</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>What a geezer'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The Business and Commercial Finance Club in central London, where the 21-year-old works, said he would not return until a full investigation had taken place.</td></tr>

<tr><td>37</td><td>'We are investigating the events in Paris and Mr Parsons will not return to work until we have conducted a full and thorough investigation,' a statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Jamie Fairbairn, an employee at highways company CVU, is also thought to have been on the train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>A spokesman for the London-based company told MailOnline he had not gone to work today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>'The alleged incident is subject to an on-going Police investigation and as such we are not at liberty to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>'CVU is an equal opportunities employer and promotes equality, diversity and inclusion throughout the workplace and through our supply chain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>'The type of behavior in this incident is unacceptable to CVU and we will be undertaking our own investigation into the matter,' a spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Jordan Munday, also named as one of those on the train, has not responded to claims he may have witnessed the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Meanwhile Mitchell McCoy, who first defended fans when the footage emerged by claiming they were singing about footballer John Terry, has not responded to claims he was also at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Chelsea has refused to reveal the identities of three ticket-holders who have been suspended from attending matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>'Chelsea Football Club is suspending three people from Stamford Bridge as a result of investigations into the incident on the Paris Metro on Tuesday,' a spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>'If it is deemed there is sufficient evidence of their involvement in the incident, the club will issue banning orders for life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>'We have received substantial information to date following our witness appeal and we are grateful to the many Chelsea supporters who have provided information so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>'Our investigations are on-going and we would request any further information is sent to customer.services@chelseafc.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>It came as the Frenchman pushed off the Metro train was revealed to be Souleymane S, 33, who said the Chelsea supporters 'should be punished' after the attack 'because of the colour of my skin'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Paris prosecutors have confirmed he made a complaint last night and that anyone convicted could face a prison term of up to three years and a fine of up to 33,000 ( 45,000).</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Mr Parsons, described by friends as an avid Ukip supporter, was said to have attended the match in Paris with his younger brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>He was described by a family member as 'lovely and gentle' yesterday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>After photographs emerged of the young man posing with Ukip leader Nigel Farage, the party issued a statement describing the incident on the metro as 'disgraceful'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>'This photograph was taken outside a London pub.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Mr Farage is photographed with and by dozens of people, both by supporters and opponents on a daily basis,' a spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>'UKIP and Mr Farage find the behaviour of the suspected Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro to be disgraceful, and shames both the country and Chelsea Football Club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Yesterday, a second man on the metro train stood behind Mr Parsons was named locally at Jordan Munday, from south-east London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>A source close to him said he had gone to the police to help with their investigation, but denied he sang any racist chants or assaulted the victim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Scotland Yard could not confirm that this afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>There is no suggestion that either was involved in the pushing of the passenger or the racist chanting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>However, having been inside the carriage during the incident, both will be key witnesses for the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Prosecutors have already launched a criminal enquiry for 'voluntary racial violence on public transport', which is punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine equivalent to 33,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Speaking for the first time, Souleymane S, said: 'I didn't know that I was filmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The fact that it is being talked about has given me the courage to go and make a complaint to the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>'These people, these English supporters ought to be found, punished and ought to be locked up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Souleymane lives in the Val-d'Oise department in the north of Paris, and was on his way home from his job close to the Richelieu-Drouot Metro station in central Paris, soon after 7pm on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>He tried to get on to a train, but found it packed with Chelsea fans on their way to watch the London side's European Champions League game against Paris St Germain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>He told Le Parisien: 'I wanted to get into the carriage but a group of English fans blocked me and pushed me away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>'I tried to force my way on, I kept trying to get back on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>In the scramble, I lost my phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>They told me things in English but I did not really understand the meaning of their words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>'I don't speak a word of English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>I understood that they were Chelsea fans, and I made the connection with the PSG match, which was taking place the same evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>'I also understood that they were attacking me because of the colour of my skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>You know, I live with racism, I was not really surprised by what happened to me, even if it was a first in the Metro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>'I stood in front of them for a long time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Someone came up to me afterwards and said I'd been brave to stand up to such people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>I think the whole thing lasted about six or seven minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Referring to Metro workers, Souleymane said: 'After while, RATP staff intervened, but only to make sure there wasn't any fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>'Their aim was to make sure the traffic resumed on the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>No other passengers defended me, but anyway, what could anyone do?</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>'Then the train left, and I walked away, and waited for the next train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>'What was I meant to say to my children?</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>That Dad was pushed and shoved in the Metro because he's black?</td></tr>

<tr><td>88</td><td>Chelsea Football Club labelled it 'abhorrent'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>It evokes the hooliganism that plagued the team in the 1970s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Last night, UK police were hunting those pictured as Chelsea launched a hotline for fans to turn them in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>They face three years in prison if caught in France, and Scotland Yard said it would consider barring them from matches for up to ten years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>The minute-long video was filmed by a British expatriate who sent it to The Guardian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>In it, the black man attempts to board, but the gang shove him off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>The commuter, who is not wearing club colours, asks them to let him on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>They shout and push him as he tries to board again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>A black woman leaves by another door as chants of 'We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it' start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Paul Nolan, who filmed the clip, told The Guardian: 'He was obviously completely shocked I don't think he realised who they were.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>'There definitely was a culture shock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>I heard a couple of French guys saying: 'I can't believe this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>The fans also chanted 'Where were you in World War Two?' at French passengers, he said.</td></tr>
