<tr><td>2</td><td>The Cotopaxi volcano near Ecuador's capital has spewed ash over a wide area in pre-dawn blasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The volcano is considered one of the world's most dangerous volcanoes due to a glacial cover that makes it prone to mud flows and its proximity to a heavily populated area, but government scientists say that the snow-capped volcano doesn't seem to be on the verge of a major eruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Its last major eruption was in 1877.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ecuadorean authorities said Monday that up to 325,000 people live in areas that could be threatened by fast-moving mud and rock flows if there is a major eruption of the Cotopaxi volcano.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Cotopaxi last rumbled Saturday, when it shot ash more than two miles high and spilled some lava.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Four hundred people were evacuated briefly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The volcano began showing renewed activity in April.</td></tr>
