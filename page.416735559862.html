<h3>Centenarian survives Nepal quake, worries he's testing fate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BIDUR, Nepal (AP) - It was an unlikely escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>By his own account, he should have died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But when the humble hut of stacked grey stones collapsed onto Funchu Tamang, who believes himself to be 101 years old, his daughter-in-law quickly pulled him from the wreckage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was hit in the chest by a rock during the quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A couple of ribs were broken, giving him trouble breathing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The next day, just when his son arrived from Nepal's northwest, Tamang was weak and delirious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I thought my father was dead," 58-year-old Bal Bahadur Tamang said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the old man had only fallen unconscious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They revived him, but a few days later it became clear he needed more medical help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His wheezing was getting worse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was tired and often dizzy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They called the Nuwakot district hospital for help, which sent a police helicopter to land near his village and bring him here on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Monday, doctors monitored Tamang's vital signs at the makeshift clinic set up in the parking lot of the district's medical office in the partially ruined town of Bidur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Funchu Tamang's ordeal is yet another of the extraordinary stories of resilience and survival coming out of Nepal after it was rocked by a 7.8-magnitude quake on April 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It killed thousands and left hundreds of thousands more homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When he arrived, doctors treated Tamang for a partially collapsed lung.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They bandaged cuts he received in the chaos after the quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Two days later, he was alert and sitting upright, chatting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>His blood pressure was a cool 101/62.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>His injuries were mostly healed, to the point where doctors said he could go home Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Funchu Tamang is so old, he has lived through two such devastating quakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But he barely remembers the 1934 temblor that hit with a magnitude of 8 and leveled cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The more recent scare, however, is fresh in his mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"This one was really bad. I was afraid. I felt as if I would die," he said from his parking lot hospital bed.</td></tr>
