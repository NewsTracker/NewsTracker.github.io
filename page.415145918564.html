<h3>Iraq launches operation to retake Tikrit from ISIS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iraqi soldiers and pro-government Shia militias were massing in preparation for an attack on ISIS strongholds including Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Backed by allied Shia, Sunni and Iranian fighters, Iraqi security forces launched a large-scale military operation Monday to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a major step in a campaign to reclaim territory in northern Iraq controlled by the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But hours into the operation, a key test for the embattled Iraqi army, the military said it still hadn't entered the city of Tikrit, indicating a long battle lies ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>State-run Al-Iraqiya television said that forces were attacking Tikrit from different directions, backed by artillery and airstrikes by Iraqi fighter jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It said the militants were dislodged from some areas outside the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Several hours into the operation, it gave no additional details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The military commander of Salahuddin region, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, told state TV the operation was "going on as planned," with fighting taking place outside Tikrit mainly on its eastern side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Until this moment we have not entered the city," al-Saadi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"God willing, we will enter, but we need some time as planned. ... God willing, victory will be achieved and Salahuddin will be turned into a grave for all terrorist groups."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tikrit, the provincial capital of Salauhddin province, 130 kilometres north of Baghdad, fell to ISIS last summer, along with the country's second-largest city of Mosul and other areas in the country's Sunni heartland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tikrit is one of the largest cities held by ISIS and lies on the road connecting Baghdad to Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Retaking it will help Iraqi forces have a major supply link for any future operation to retake Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>U.S. military officials have said a co-ordinated military mission to retake Mosul will likely begin in April or May and involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the Americans have cautioned that if the Iraqis aren't ready, the offensive could be delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The U.S.-led coalition launching airstrikes targeting ISIS were not involved in the Tikrit operation, Iraqi officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>American officials had no immediate comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Iraqi Hezbollah fighters carry the coffin of a comrade who was killed in Tikrit fighting ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Past attempts to retake Tikrit have failed, however, as Iraq struggles with its armed forces, which collapsed in the wake of the ISIS's offensive last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Iraqi forces battling near Tikrit also apparently have the help of Iranian Gen. Ghasem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, who arrived there two days ago, the Iranian semi-official Fars news agency reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The powerful general has emerged as the chief tactician in Iraq's fight against the Sunni militants, working on the front lines alongside dozens of advisers from his country's Revolutionary Guard to direct Shia militiamen and government forces in the smallest details of some battles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Fars also reported drones were flying over Tikrit, without identifying whether the drones were Iranian or Iraqi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Hours after the offensive began, the UN special envoy in Iraq appealed to warring groups to avoid attacking civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Military operations reinforced by international and Iraqi air support must be conducted with the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties, and with full respect for fundamental human rights principles and humanitarian law," Nickolay Mladenov said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Monday afternoon, a gasoline tanker rigged with a bomb exploded as soldiers and Shia militiamen tried to dismantle it in the village of al-Jalam south of Tikrit, killing seven troops and wounding 15, police and hospital officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Al-Jalam, a farming area that has been a stronghold of Sunni militants, is located outside the Sunni city of Samarra, 95 kilometres north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Tikrit is an important test case for Iraq's Shia-led government, which is trying to reassert authority over the divided country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>ISIS fighters have a strong presence in the city and are expected to put up fierce resistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The offensive comes as momentum has begun to shift since Iraqi soldiers, backed by airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition, took back the nearby refinery town of Beiji in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Any operation to take Mosul would require Iraq to seize Tikrit first because of its strategic location for military enforcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam, and the Shia majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Since Saddam was toppled in a U.S.-led invasion in 2003, the Sunni minority has felt increasingly marginalized by the Shia-led government in Baghdad, and in 2006 long-running tensions boiled over into sectarian violence that claimed tens of thousands of lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>While the TV said Shia and Sunni tribal fighters were co-operating in Monday's offensive, Tikrit is an important Sunni stronghold, and the presence of Shia forces risks could prompt a backlash among Sunnis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shia militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq.</td></tr>

<h3>North Korea fires ballistic missiles into the sea in protest against military drills in South Korea</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A spokesman for the secretive state threatened 'merciless strikes' against South Korea and its ally the U.S., which helps conduct the military drills every year and insists they are just defensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The war between the two Koreas is still active because it ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty, and left a heavily armed two-and-a-half mile wide zone along the border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Making a statement: South Korean TV shows the two missile tests by the North today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>North Korea regularly conducts test firings of missiles, rockets and artillery, but they are often timed to express the country's dissatisfaction with actions by Washington and Seoul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The missiles were fired early this morning at the start of military drills which are due to run until the end of April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fired from the west coast, they flew around 300 miles across the width of North Korea before landing in waters off the east coast, according to South Korea's Defense Ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Spokesman Kim Min-seok called the launches an 'armed protest' against the South Korea-U.S. drills and a challenge to peace on the Korean Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>UN resolutions prohibit any ballistic missile test by North Korea, and Mr Kim said Pyongyang appeared intent on triggering a 'security crisis'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A statement carried by North Korea's state-run news agency said: 'The situation on the Korean peninsula is again inching close to the brink of a war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'The only means to cope with the aggression and war by the U.S. imperialists and their followers is neither dialogue nor peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Officials in the North Korean capital Pyongyang claim the drills are 'intolerable aggression' and preparation for an invasion - but South Korea says they are simply routine exercises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The largest element of the two drills that began today is Foal Eagle, an eight-week exercise involving air, ground and naval field training, with around 200,000 Korean and 3,700 US troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The other is a week-long, largely computer-simulated joint drill called Key Resolve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Around 28,500 American soldiers are deployed in South Korea as deterrence against potential aggression from the North.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>North Korea has threatened attacks, including nuclear strikes, on the U.S. before, although it has never demonstrated its missiles could reach the U.S. mainland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>During the 2013 drills, tension rose amid North Korean rhetoric that included vows of nuclear strikes on Washington and Seoul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>North Korea has carried out three nuclear tests - in 2006, 2009 and 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In January, the North offered a moratorium on further tests if this year's joint drills were cancelled - a proposal rejected by Washington as an 'implicit threat' to carry out a fourth atomic detonation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jeung Young-Tae, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said Pyongyang was unlikely to conduct a fourth test just to protest against the exercises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'Nuclear tests carry more significance than that,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'On the other hand, there is the chance of a mid- or long-range missile test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'I would say that a demonstration that it could deliver a nuclear warhead would be more threatening to the world than an actual nuclear test'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A new research report by U.S. experts published last week estimated that North Korea could be on track to have an arsenal of 100 nuclear weapons by 2020.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In a further sign of rising tensions, North Korean state-run website Uriminzokkiri warned today of a fierce response to any attempt by South Korean activists to float anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border by balloon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'The response might not just be a few shots of gunfire but cannons or missiles,' the website said.</td></tr>
