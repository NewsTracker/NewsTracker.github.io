<h3>Cannes: Amputee Stopped 'For Not Wearing Heels'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Producer Valeria Richter, who had part of her left foot amputated, tells Sky News she was stopped on her way into a premiere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Everyone is keen to put their best foot forward on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it is the fashion police rather than the frocks that are making headlines - after women in flat shoes were allegedly turned away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Film producer Valeria Richter says she was stopped at a gala premiere for not wearing high heels - despite a visible disability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She told Sky News: "Two years ago I had part of my left foot amputated so I can't really wear heels anymore you walk all day we're all working women at Cannes, the last thing you really want is to stand in high heels just for a three-minute walk up a red carpet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She added: "We shouldn't be forced to wear heels - look at fashion and how it changes, almost anything goes in fashion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"A festival of the scope and the glamour of Cannes should follow in the footsteps of fashion and be much more inclusive of what's allowed on the red carpet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She was stopped four times on her way into the premiere of Gus Van Sant's Sea of Trees on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ms Richter, who was eventually allowed in, spoke after Cannes was accused of turning away women in flat shoes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Asif Kapadia, whose Amy Winehouse documentary premiered in Cannes at the weekend, said his wife had been stopped on the red carpet for wearing flats but was "eventually let in".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The "flat ban" has sparked a backlash on social media - with women posting pictures of their comfortable shoes with the hashtag "show me your flats".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Now even the stars are stepping in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When asked about the controversy British actress Emily Blunt, whose latest film Sicario debuted in Cannes on Tuesday, said: "Everyone should wear flats, to be honest, at the best of times, we shouldn't wear high heels anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"That's just my point of view, I just prefer wearing Converse sneakers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rebel model Cara Delevigne was also shocked at the reports, she said: "A flats ban? I'm going to wear flats now, for that reason. Are you kidding me?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Festival director Thierry Fremaux has said "rumours" of a ban on heels were "unfounded".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Writing on Twitter, he said: "For the stairs, the regulations have not changed: 'No smoking, formal wear'. There is no mention of heels."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The PR stumble is even more awkward for Cannes during a year in which it is seeking to address sexism in cinema.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The festival opened with a female-directed film for the first time since 1987, and organisers have endorsed a series of "Women in Motion" talks by stars such as Isabella Rossellini and Salma Hayek.</td></tr>
