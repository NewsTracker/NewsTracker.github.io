<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamic State militants are in full control of the famed archaeological site in the ancient town of Palmyra in central Syria, according to activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The extremists overran the site to the south-west of the town shortly after midnight, said Rami Abdurrahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bebars al-Talawy, an activist in the central province of Homs, also said IS controls the ruins at Palmyra, a Unesco world heritage site famous for its 2,000-year-old Roman-era colonnades and other ruins and priceless artefacts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Both activists said IS has not damaged the ruins so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There are fears the extremists will destroy the ruins as they did major archaeological sites in Iraq.</td></tr>
