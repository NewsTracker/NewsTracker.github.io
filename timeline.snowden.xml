    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"I feel like this story is a very fresh story. Its themes, I think, will resonate with people. Charlie Hebdo. (Edward) Snowden. There's interesting elements to this season, and it brings a lot of things together. And as long as they keep it fresh, it's a show that's never the same season after season, and those kinds of shows are the shows that can run."&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
