<h3>Islamic State might be harvesting organs, Iraq envoy to U.N. says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A video purporting to show the mass beheading of Coptic Christian hostages was released Sunday by militants in Libya affiliated with the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have bodies. Come and examine them," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is clear they are missing certain parts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He also said a dozen doctors have been "executed" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of "crimes of genocide" in targeting certain ethnic groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that "it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He used an acronym for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control," Mladenov said.</td></tr>
