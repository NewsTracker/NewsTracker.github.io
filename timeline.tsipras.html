<li>Less than 24 hours after he wrote a conciliatory letter to creditors asking for a new bailout that would accept many of their terms, Tsipras abruptly switched back into combative mode in a television address.</li>
<li>Euro zone finance ministers held an hour-long conference call to discuss the previous night's offer from Tsipras, but were adamant that no further discussions would be held until after Sunday's vote.</li>
<li>In his overnight letter to creditors, seen by Reuters, Tsipras agreed to accept most of their demands for taxes and pension cuts and asked for a new 29 billion euro loan to cover all debt service payments in the next two years.</li>
<li>Lagarde declined to be drawn out on whether she viewed Tsipras was a reliable negotiating partner after his latest switch, although she did say the Fund wanted to see evidence of reforms before talks about any new potential debt package.</li>
<li>The Tsipras letter asking for a new bailout deal appeared to move closer to accepting creditor demands.</li>

<li>ATHENS, Greece - A government official says Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has told senior aides to "forget about elections or a referendum," whatever the outcome of the country's talks with creditors.</li>
<li>The official said Tsipras told four senior ministers Friday that his government, elected last January, has a fresh popular mandate and that "people have trusted us to take crucial decisions and manage the difficulties."</li>
<li>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks, on Saturday quoted Tsipras as saying his government would deal with an agreement with creditors "however difficult the compromise."</li>
