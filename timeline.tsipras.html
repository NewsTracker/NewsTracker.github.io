<li>Tsipras appealed to other EU countries to reject the alternative solution that Germany was suggesting, which he claimed would only prolong the agony.</li>
<li>A majority of 222 MPs approved the 400-page draft deal with 64 voting against, including 40 from Tsipras' own leftist party ranks.</li>
<li>Tsipras said that failure to ratify the deal would enable Germany to push forward its proposal for a bridging loan.</li>

<li>Tsipras effectively lost his majority in parliament in a vote three weeks ago, when nearly one-fourth of Syriza's lawmakers refused to back new austerity measures.</li>
<li>"We have to agree that we can't go on this way," Tsipras told the committee members during a dramatic 12-hour meeting.</li>
<li>Also on Friday, Tsipras is due to appear in parliament to answer qustions from the opposition about contingency plans to adopt a parallel payment system that could have facilitated a euro exit.</li>

<li>Under the plan, which the report said went back to before Tsipras was elected in January, transactions through the parallel system would have been nominated in euros but could easily change into drachmas overnight, he was quoted as saying.</li>
