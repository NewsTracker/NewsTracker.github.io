<h3>U.S. refinery strike widens to include nation's largest refinery</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Strikes are underway or have been called at 15 plants, including 12 refineries with a fifth of U.S. crude processing capacity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The stoppages, which have forced companies to rely on trained temporary workers to keep plants running close to normal, are the largest in the refining sector since 1980.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Shortly after talks between union and oil company representatives ended on Friday night, the union notified Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] of a strike by its members at the company's 600,250 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The USW also gave notices on Friday of strikes to begin in 24 hours at Motiva's 235,000 bpd Convent, Louisiana and 238,000 bpd Norco, Louisiana refineries and the Shell Oil Co chemical plant in Norco, the union said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The industry's refusal to meaningfully address safety issues through good faith bargaining gave us no other option but to expand our work stoppage," USW International President Leo Gerard said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Both sides indicated further negotiations this weekend had not been scheduled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Motiva is a 50-50 joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL].</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Shell's U.S. arm Shell Oil Co is the lead oil company negotiator in talks with the USW for a national agreement on safety, pay and benefits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Shell spokesman said the company was disappointed by the Port Arthur walkout and strike notices to the Louisiana plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We believe this move sets the wrong tone for both parties to move forward and reach an agreement," said Shell spokesman Ray Fisher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We remain committed to continued safe operations and productive negotiations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The strike that began Feb. 1 was last expanded Feb. 6, when workers at BP Plc-operated refineries in Indiana and Ohio were told to begin a work stoppage the following day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Workers were already on strike at Shell's 327,000 bpd joint-venture refinery in Deer Park, Texas, and an adjoining chemical plant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Deer Park workforce walked out when the strike began on Feb. 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The strike may complicate operations at the Port Arthur refinery, which failed to restore its second largest crude distillation unit (CDU) to full production after restarting on Friday following a three-day shutdown to fix leaking piping, sources told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 195,000 bpd CDU is one of three at the refinery that do the initial refining of crude oil coming into the plant and provide feedstock for all other production units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The refinery's largest CDU, which has a rated capacity of 325,000, bpd is running at about 200,000 bpd, the sources said, because a 60,000 bpd hydrocracking unit is shut due to a malfunction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The hydrocracker produces motor fuel, primarily diesel, which has become a lucrative export for U.S. refiners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Motiva also shut a 92,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at the refinery in early January for an overhaul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It is scheduled to restart in the first half of March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Shell and the union had been meeting continuously since talks resumed on Wednesday following a week-long break for the company to reply to an information request and a counterproposal from the USW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Union negotiators rejected the seventh contract offer from Shell on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Earlier this week, the USW's lead negotiator, International Vice President Gary Beevers, told Reuters that safe staffing levels at refineries and chemical plants were a sticking point in the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Another point of contention is the absence of "no retrogression" language, which preserves agreements from previous contracts not addressed in negotiations this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In addition to the two BP-operated plants, workers are striking at refineries and plants owned by Lyondell Basell, Marathon Petroleum Corp, and Tesoro Corp in California, Kentucky, Texas and Washington state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Only one refinery has shut down due to the strike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Tesoro's 166,000-bpd plant in Martinez, California, was scheduled prior to the strike for a partial shutdown to perform a planned multi-unit overhaul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Company officials decided to idle the entire plant after the walkout began and said production would not resume during the work stoppage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The USW is seeking a three-year, industrywide pact that would cover 30,000 workers at 63 U.S. refineries that together account for two-thirds of domestic capacity.</td></tr>

<h3>#Coin for Abbott: Indonesians' angry backlash at PM's Bali Nine diplomacy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bali: Prime Minister Tony Abbott is facing an Indonesian social media backlash over his linking of $1 billion in tsunami aid to the mercy campaign for Bali Nine death-row inmates Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, with a campaign urging people to collect coins to return to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On the streets of Indonesian cities people were asking motorists and passersby for spare change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Meanwhile, social media users were posting pictures of the money they had gathered and hurling insults at Mr Abbott and Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Many also expressed their support for death by firing squad for Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The delay in executions has been linked to everything from phone taps to the unpopularity of PM Tony Abbott, pictured here with Joko Widodo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The twitter campaign, using the hashtags #KoinuntukAustralia, #coinforAustralia and #coinforAbbott and growing rapidly in popularity, highlights how Mr Abbott's remarks have backfired badly in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Abbott said: "Let's not forget that a few years ago when Indonesia was struck by the Indian Ocean tsunami, Australia sent a billion dollars worth of assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I would say to the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government: we in Australia are always there to help you and we hope that you might reciprocate in this way at this time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop was forced to call Indonesia's vice president Jusuf Kalla the next day to clarify the comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Her diplomacy seemed to soothe the concerns of Indonesia's leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Its president Joko Widodo said he was satisfied by the explanation on Friday, while also revealing that his government had been preparing a formal rebuke to Mr Abbott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But many ordinary Indonesians remain enraged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The campaign originated in Aceh, the Indonesian province that was hit hardest by the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 that killed more than 100,000 people there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Among those behind the campaign are victims of the tsunami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's not making any sense. How can aid be mentioned again?," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"If they weren't sincere, the community will give it back" he told Tempo, an Indonesian media outlet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Twitter, Mr Riza said the Australian prime minister was "seungke", referring to an Acehnese saying that those who take back a gift will suffer a skin condition on their elbow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile, supporters of Chan and Sukumaran brought more than 100 bunches of flowers to Kerobokan prison to thank the governor and guards - as well as the Australians - for their efforts to introduce rehabilitation programs in the penitentiary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The flowers were organised by the Mothers for Mercy organisation, a Bali-based group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While there is sympathy for the duo in Bali, especially among expatriates, it does not extend much beyond the confines of the holiday island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Unlike the rest of Indonesia, many Balinese are aware of the extraordinary reforms at Kerobokan instigated by the Chan, Sukumaran and the prison staff.</td></tr>
