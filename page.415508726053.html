<h3>David Levithan interview: The US author on leading the way in LGBT fiction for young adults</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When his 2003 debut, Boy Meets Boy, became a runaway bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic, it also courted - as runaway bestsellers often do - an attendant controversy, not merely because his lead characters were gay, but because they weren't persecuted or in peril, but simply in love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I guess that the book was seen as pretty daring at the time," Levithan, 42, says from his home in Hoboken, New Jersey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It was probably a radical notion in literature back then that teenagers could be gay, and happy, and in love, and that this alone would drive the plot forward. The book would not be seen as groundbreaking in the same way if it were published now because we have, at last, moved on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His new book, Hold Me Closer, illustrates just how much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's what he calls a "musical novel", (in the way that Glee was a musical TV drama; in other words, it frequently breaks out into song), and is narrated by Tiny Cooper, a character who last featured in Will Grayson, Will Grayson, the book Levithan co-wrote in 2010 with YA titan John Green (The Fault in our Stars).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tiny Cooper, the self-appointed "world's gayest person", was Will Grayson's break-out star, and the subject of an awful lot of subsequent fan mail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Published later this month, it is expected to be a bestseller among gay and straight readers alike, but as Levithan suggests, it would have struggled to find a mainstream publisher 20 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"But this is where we are now," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We know that there are kids like this out there, and that they need the context of literature to help them navigate their own identity, and the world around them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His is far from a lone voice in the growing LGBT YA world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As an editor for the US publisher Scholastic, he is also responsible for helping bring a wide range of books to commercial attention, many featuring gay, bisexual and transgender characters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One of Scholastic's most anticipated 2015 titles is a book called George by the writer Alex Gino, about a transgender fourth grader (nine or 10 years old) who takes the titular role in a school production of Charlotte's Web, and in doing so finds acceptance from his peers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"These are exciting times in YA publishing," says Levithan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We're looking for diversity, and also diversity within that diversity. The notion that there is just one gay story to tell is as ridiculous as suggesting there is just one straight story. We need so many more voices."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A decade previously, things were different, and gay narratives were often frowned upon in teen fiction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Homosexuality was at last starting to be openly discussed in schools, but not everyone relished the prospect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Levithan's Boy Meets Boy proved a flashpoint; many school libraries refused to carry it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"That reaction came from fear, I think," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It's like, if you don't talk about something, then it doesn't exist. But books like mine were so out there that they couldn't be ignored; they were not closeted books."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The author himself has always been out, ever since a nursery school teacher, concerned he was playing more with girls than with boys, thought his parents should be forewarned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"My mom and dad didn't quite know how to react to the teacher's concern," he says now, "but it wasn't a big deal. My uncle was out, and he blazed a trail for me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Having written stories from a precociously young age, it was inevitable, once he started writing professionally, that Levithan would choose to reflect his own life experiences on the page, not least as so few others were managing to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I guess people feared we were legitimising the gay lifestyle, and that in doing so, impressionable readers might become gay as a result."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He laughs thinly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I really wish I could write a novel that had that kind of power, but I'm not that good a writer. Besides, that suggestion is merely a sideways way of saying we don't want gay kids in our schools, rather than admitting that of course there are gay kids in our schools, and they deserve to be represented in literature."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But even now, there continues to be resistance to acknowledging teenage sexuality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A recent news report suggested that one in five gay teenagers in the UK suffers from homophobic abuse from teachers and other adults in schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"That's sort of horrifying," Levithan says, "because it confirms that there are still certain deeply ingrained prejudices around."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In such cases, he adds: "Why choose to do the job you are doing at all? You're not a librarian to keep books out of the hands of children, and I don't know teachers who get into teaching to prevent kids from learning about who they are. I would hate for all teachers to be defined by the bad ones, but there are clearly many who bring their own bias to work when they are not supposed to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Which is perhaps one reason why so many children turn to books for empathy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The rising popularity of YA novels has also increased their power as educational tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Levithan's 2013 book Two Boys Kissing, for example, was inspired by the ignorance of today's teenagers on the still-prevalent dangers of HIV and Aids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"It's scary how ignorant they can be today," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I wrote that book because there seems to be such a disconnect between the generations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The disconnect, he believes, is due in part to the internet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Whatever your identity is, you can nowadays go online and quickly find information about it, see images, and whatever else you want, but what is missing is the context, the emotion, how it really feels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Which is where YA books come in, because books, more than anything else, I think, can help illuminate these things. We don't necessarily try to be educators, but education is a by-product of the one thing that underscores all these books: being truthful about who we are, the lives we lead."</td></tr>

<h3>Trending at SXSW: Mind cloning, off-the-grid messaging</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Top tech influencers pondered immortality and mind cloning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FireChat, an app that lets smartphone users connect via mobile chat even without a cellular connection, was another hot topic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Here's a look at the most notable trending topics Sunday at the tech jamboree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No cell service?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>No problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An app called FireChat uses phone signals such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to connect to other users' phones and enable chats without any network connection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The app, created by a San Francisco startup called Open Garden, debuted in 2012 and was a hit last August at the Burning Man festival in Black Rock, Nevada, where cell phone service is scarce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It links people via what it calls a "peer-to-peer mesh network," connecting through phone signals rather than a network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The range is about 90 feet but the connection can jump from phone to phone if there's a crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's software-only, says co-founder and CEO Micha Benoliel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Currently the app supports public group chats and hashtags; private messaging is coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The app, which is a finalist for South by Southwest's innovation awards, has 5 million users and has been used by tens of thousands of people in India and the Philippines at political protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As a new startup, Benoliel says his first time at South by Southwest has been positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The best surprise has been going to parties and having people asking how they can use FireChat for their event," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>United Therapeutics CEO Martine Rothblatt, who considers herself a "transhumanist," discussed advances in "mind cloning" in a keynote Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She said she believes people will one day be able to clone their cognitive functions, and detailed her biotech company's advances in cloning organs and making the process of transferring organs from donor to recipient more efficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Rothblatt urged everyone to question authority and noted that in other eras she might not have survived as a transgender person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I was fortunate to be born in California and to have a president who can easily say the word transgender without tripping over it," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In a separate panel, transgender tech executives discussed challenges they've faced in the industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Brielle Harrison, a senior software engineer at Facebook who helped the social media site revise its gender options, talked about having a "perma smile" on her face after she came out as transgender at work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"It's one of those things you're generally born with, you have one choice, hide or not hide," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"You realize we just need to help educate and have other people understand that we have the same desires, passions, hurt feelings and emotions that everybody else has."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The line to hear digital media futurist Amy Webb speak stretched around the corner at the new J.W. Marriott hotel in Austin long after the panel started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Webb, whose clients include Twitter, Time and ad agency Publicis, says she studies how and why people are wasting their time on mobile and where they are having difficulty with technology in order to predict new trends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Two areas she predicts will be big in 2015: "haptics," which add a tactical component to notifications, and mobile ambient alerts, which could buzz to notify you without being overly intrusive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some examples of "haptics" include the Pavlok app's electric shock, which can punish users if they smoke or overeat, or a shirt by Australian company Foxtel called "Alert Shirt" that uses wearable technology to let soccer fans feel the body blows their favorite soccer player gets during a game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Using ambient alerts, a finance app could buzz when you are considering a purchase - a nudge to remind you "do not try to purchase something right now," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Festival goers needing a break from the hubbub of SXSW can take a trip back in time with an immersive audio tour from startup Detour that lets listeners discover Austin in 1885, "the year that broke Austin."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The tour leads users to key locations in a tale about a time when the city did not yet have electric street lights and there was a possible serial killer on the loose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The audio tour leads listeners into historic sites, stores and bars along the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The public-radio show Radiolab created the content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"You'll get the smell of 1885 in your nostrils, the sound of murder ballads in your ears, and -if you're in the mood - the taste of tequila on your tongue," according to an online description.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The tour was created by San Francisco-based Detour, a startup headed by Groupon founder Andrew Mason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Detour has seven audio tours available in San Francisco and created the Austin tour to get the attention of South by Southwest attendees.</td></tr>
