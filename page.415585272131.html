<h3>Blood on gloves in Boston bomber's car matched that of dead officer - VIDEO: Owner of boat where Tsarnaev hid testifies - Full Coverage: Boston Marathon bombing trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tsarnaev, 21, faces the possibility of the death penalty for his role in the 2013 deadly bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements that he participated in the bombings but said his older brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His lawyer also said it was Tamerlan, not Dzhokhar, who shot Officer Sean Collier as the brothers tried to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jennifer Montgomery, a DNA analyst with the state police crime lab, testified Wednesday that Collier's blood was on a pair of gloves found near the gas pedal and driver's seat of Tsarnaev's Honda Civic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prosecutors have said the brothers fled the scene of Collier's shooting in the Honda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An MIT graduate student who was riding his bike by the scene of the shooting identified Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as the man he saw leaning into Collier's police cruiser the night he was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Collier was shot six times, including three times in the head at close range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>During cross-examination by Tsarnaev's lawyers, Montgomery said she also tested blood on the sweatshirt Dzhokhar wore when Collier was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>None of the blood was Collier's; it was all Dzhokhar's blood, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After Collier's killing, the Tsarnaevs had a wild shootout with police in Watertown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following the gunfight and being run over by his brother as he fled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dzhokhar was found hours later, wounded and bloodied, hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>During earlier testimony Wednesday, jurors were shown two pipe bombs hurled at police during the shootout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Neither of those bombs exploded, but a third pipe bomb did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A pressure-cooker bomb similar to the bombs used in the marathon attacks caused a powerful explosion that shook houses on the street and sent debris raining down on police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Trooper Robert McCarthy also showed the jury a Tupperware container filled with explosive powder and fuses found in a car stolen by the Tsarnaevs just before the firefight with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers showed the jury a photo of receipts Tamerlan had from a gun and ammunition store and for two backpacks and a soldering gun purchased in the days and weeks before the marathon bombings, apparently in an attempt to show that Tamerlan had a larger role in the bombings than Dzhokhar did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>While cross-examining a fingerprint expert, Tsarnaev's lawyers asked him to identify receipts found inside Tamerlan's wallet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Also in the wallet was a MoneyGram receipt reflecting a $900 transfer to Russia by Tamerlan.</td></tr>

<h3>Emails sought of nearly a dozen U.S. State Department workers under Clinton</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Representative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Benghazi Select Committee, told Reuters these included aides to Clinton and perhaps "aides to aides."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We sent a subpoena to the State Department for emails from a number of individuals within the State Department, other than Secretary Clinton," Gowdy, a Republican, said in a phone interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A New York Times report this month that Clinton had used a personal email account for government business while the chief U.S. diplomat from 2009 to 2013 has reinvigorated the committee's investigation into the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>11, 2012, attacks that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 even though she has yet to formally declare her candidacy, has come under scrutiny from Republicans who accuse her State Department of failing to protect diplomatic personnel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gowdy said the State Department had asked him not to disclose the names of people whose emails were sought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gowdy has said that without the emails, no congressional committee investigating the Benghazi attack could claim to have issued a definitive report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton has said that although she should have used a government email account, she violated no rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Democrats say that Benghazi has been thoroughly investigated by several congressional panels and that Gowdy's committee's efforts are politically motivated and aimed at undermining Clinton's expected presidential candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters the committee "has spent millions of dollars; produced nothing. I think we're going to just see an ongoing attempt to investigate Hillary Clinton, whatever the subject, whether it's her emails or it's her hair or whatever it happens to be."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Gowdy spoke to Reuters on the same day Senator Charles Grassley sent letters to Secretary of State John Kerry and the State Department's inspector general asking for information on the emails of Huma Abedin, who was a top aide to Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Grassley said he was probing Clinton's use of a program that let some of Clinton's allies, including Abedin, do private sector work while also working for the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gowdy said he was not coordinating his probe with Grassley, and rejected any suggestion that the State Department might become overworked with requests for information about Clinton and her aides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The revelations about Clinton's emails have raised questions about the State Department's email practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Earlier on Thursday, U.S. officials said the State Department does not automatically archive the emails of its assistant secretaries of state, contradicting the department's prior public statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Gowdy said no decisions had been made in the House of Representatives about when Clinton would be called to testify, either about her email use or about the Benghazi events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Earlier Gowdy had said he hoped to call Clinton to testify in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Thursday he said the slowness of responses to his requests for information from Clinton and the State Department had delayed that timetable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said he wanted all relevant documents before she appears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Benghazi Select Committee also subpoenaed all communications of Clinton's related to Libya this month, but neither Clinton nor the State Department have produced documents in response to the subpoenas, Gowdy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Earlier the State Department gave the committee 300 of Clinton's emails related to Benghazi.</td></tr>
