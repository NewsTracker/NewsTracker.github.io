<h3>Gerard Depardieu intervened for FIFA box office flop at Cannes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Gerard Depardieu and FIFA President Sepp Blatter, right, in Cannes, France, on May 18, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>PARIS -- Actor Gerard Depardieu personally intervened to persuade the Cannes Film Festival to show the FIFA-funded movie "United Passions" that sank almost without trace at the box office after being panned by critics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In an Associated Press interview, Cannes director Thierry Fremaux said he initially rejected the movie, thinking it unworthy of the world-famous festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Depardieu, who plays World Cup creator Jules Rimet in the film, pressured 2014 festival organizers to rethink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They agreed to let it be shown in the open air on a beach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That green light was enough to allow marketers to attach the prestigious Cannes name -- its palm-leaf logo and the words "official selection, festival de Cannes" -- to "United Passions" trailers and posters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Gerard Depardieu was very insistent. He really wanted us to show it," said Fremaux, speaking Monday by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I'm not saying we did it to keep him happy, but let's say that he insisted a lot."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The French actor ("Green Card," "Cyrano de Bergerac") has long ties with Cannes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In 1992, he presided over the jury that awards the festival's coveted Palme d'Or prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He also has ties with Russia, the next World Cup host in 2018.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He accepted a Russian passport from President Vladimir Putin in 2013 after a falling out with France's ruling Socialist government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fremaux attended the beach showing with FIFA President Sepp Blatter and Depardieu in 2014, after changing his initial position that the movie was unworthy of Cannes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I rejected the film. At the beginning, I said 'Out of the question,' because the film lacks the quality to be part of the official selection," he told the AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Then they said, 'Why not on the beach?' I said, 'Ah, the beach. Yes, it's a festival. It's football. It's the general public. OK."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>FIFA did not pay Cannes to show the movie, Fremaux said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The movie bombed on its release this month in the United States, taking only about $900 in an opening weekend at 10 theatres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In France, it went straight to DVD and was released in only a handful of other countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>According to box-office data firm Rentrak, it made only $178,639 in theatres before opening in the U.S., most of that in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>FIFA largely bankrolled the $30-million movie about soccer's governing body, the growth of its World Cup tournament and Blatter's rise to power as FIFA president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Played by Tim Roth ("Reservoir Dogs"), Blatter is portrayed sympathetically in the movie as a hard worker who toiled to make FIFA financially successful and spoke out against corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In real life, FIFA is embroiled in U.S. and Swiss anti-corruption investigations and Blatter is on his way out with his 17-year presidency widely criticized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Critics savaged the movie: "Pure cinematic excrement" wrote the London Guardian, "cringe-worthy, self-aggrandizing" said the Hollywood Reporter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Fremaux was more charitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I don't find the movie horrible at all," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"It should have been a television movie."</td></tr>
