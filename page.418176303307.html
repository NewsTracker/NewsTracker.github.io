<h3>The Latest: Fitch Downgrades Greece Further Into Junk Status</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece has suffered its second sovereign downgrade in as many days, as its bailout program was due to expire after five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fitch ratings agency has slashed the country's rating further in junk status, from CCC to CC - following a similar action Monday by Standard & Poor's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The rating is one notch above the level where Fitch says default is inevitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fitch said: "The breakdown of the negotiations between the Greek government and its creditors has significantly increased the risk that Greece will not be able to honour its debt obligations in the coming months, including bonds held by the private sector."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The eurozone's top official, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, says "it would be crazy to extend" the Greek bailout beyond its midnight expiration since Greece won't accept the European proposals on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dijsselbloem said after a teleconference of the 19 eurozone finance ministers that a Greek request for a new European aid program would be considered later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But after months of fruitless negotiations, Dijsselbloem said there was no point in continuing the current program since "all the proposals have been rejected and the Greek government has called a referendum and advised the people to vote no."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An EU official says that Greece's creditors did not agree Tuesday on a new bailout deal or extension for Greece and will instead, starting Wednesday, focus on a new plan for the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because the announcement was not official, said "clearly no agreement tonight. They will reconvene tomorrow to discuss a follow-up agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Greece had made a last-ditch proposal before its bailout program expires at the end of the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As a midnight deadline closes in, the head of the agency responsible for preserving financial security in the European Union says "it is regrettable" that Greece has no new bailout program in the pipeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece's European bailout program ends at the end of Tuesday, and the country has not managed to agree on an extension or a new deal with creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>European Financial Stability Facility chief Klaus Regling says the impasse puts "the positive results of the (current) program at risk."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The EFSF is Greece's largest creditor by far and the government in Athens has an outstanding loan for 130.9 billion euros ($145.9 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A Greek government official says that the teleconference among eurozone finance ministers to discuss a last-minute deal proposal by Greece has ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The official adds that another will be held Wednesday morning so the ministers can examine the Greek proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations, did not give details of the discussions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Greece's foreign ministry says it's assessing how to assist Greeks abroad - such as tourists, students or pensioners - who are affected by the money controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The government has limited daily cash withdrawals to 60 euros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>All credit or debit card payments abroad have been blocked, and any money transfers abroad need prior approval by a new committee.</td></tr>
