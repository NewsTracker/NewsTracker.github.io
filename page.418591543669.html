<h3>Movie review: 'Mr Holmes' makes Sherlock seem real</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In "Mr. Holmes," Ian McKellen and director Bill Condon reunite for another story about an aging man confronting his mortality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Their first collaboration, 1998's Oscar-winning "Gods and Monsters," centered on filmmaker James Whale, best known for the groundbreaking 1930s horror classics "Frankenstein" and its superior sequel, "Bride of Frankenstein."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Although that earlier movie was based on a speculative novel, Whale was a real person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In "Mr. Holmes," which is an adaptation of Mitch Cullin's book "A Slight Trick of the Mind," McKellen is playing a fictional character - the uncannily gifted detective Sherlock Holmes - but the movie treats him as if he had actually existed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a bit of meta-revisionism, we learn the author of the novels that made Holmes famous were actually written by his former assistant Dr. Watson, who is now married and presumably raising a family somewhere else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Holmes is 93, retired, suffering from Alzheimer's and living alone in rural Sussex in 1947, tended to by his widowed maid (Laura Linney) and her 10-year-old son Roger (Milo Parker).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Holmes keeps himself busy with his hobbies, gardening and beekeeping (he uses their royal jelly as an herbal treatment for his condition).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When Roger asks him if the bees are dangerous, Holmes proudly declares he's been stung 786 times (naturally, he kept count) but they are otherwise harmless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Although he's not much for fiction ("I've never had much use for imagination. I prefer facts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the film also inspires Holmes to revisit the case Watson wrote about - the one that got away unsolved and made him put down his magnifying glass for good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In these early scenes, Condon builds a stately pace and a serene aura that befits his protagonist: This is not the charismatic Sherlock Holmes played by Benedict Cumberbatch or Robert Downey Jr., but an irritable, somewhat frightened man who is hanging on to his most prized commodity - his mind - by writing notes to himself on the cuffs of his shirtsleeves and keeping a chart of every time his memory fails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>McKellen, who is 76 (and sports makeup effects to make him look older), captures the frailty and lament of a man in his 90s, aware he's nearing the end of his life and nagged by regret over something from his past he can't quite remember.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So the detective embarks on one final case, writing his own novel as a counterpoint to Watson's version of the events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>From here, the movie jumps to intriguing life, juggling three plot strands - the present, Holmes' investigation of a musical instrument with magical powers 30 years earlier and a trip to Japan to obtain rare ash from Hiroshima - via flashbacks and leaps in time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Initially, the structure feels a bit bewildering: The tender, grandfatherly relationship between Holmes and the fatherless Roger is much more involving than all this other side business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Condon and screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher reward your patience by bringing the threads together in a beautiful, stirring manner that celebrates the genius of the literary icon while also honoring the man McKellen is playing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sherlock Holmes may have never really walked the earth, but "Mr. Holmes" humanizes him to such a degree, you walk out of the theater practically convinced you've just watched a biopic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Cast: Ian McKellen, Laura Linney, Milo Parker, Hiroyuki Sanada, Hattie Morahan, Patrick Kennedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Director: Bill Condon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Screenwriter: Jeffrey Hatcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Based on the book "A Slight Trick of the Mind" by Mitch Cullin.</td></tr>
