<h3>State Official: Hillary Clinton Email Practices 'Not Acceptable'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>State department official says use of private email server as Clinton did 'not acceptable.'</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hillary Clinton's use of private email was not appropriate, a State Department official told a Senate committee on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - A State Department assistant secretary said Wednesday it's "not acceptable" for any agency employee to conduct government business on a private email server as former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Joyce Barr, the agency's chief freedom of information officer, made the comment under questioning from Republican senators who used a Senate Judiciary hearing on open records laws to attack Clinton over her email practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said that Clinton's approach amounted to a "premeditated and deliberate" attempt to avoid open records requirements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said that anyone who took such an approach should be fired, and asked Barr whether it would be considered acceptable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Barr said that she had not been aware of Clinton's decision to conduct all her State Department email on a private server but that the agency has now made it clear to employees that such an approach would not be acceptable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think that the actions that we've taken in the course of recovering these emails have made it very clear what people's responsibilities are with regard to record-keeping," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We continue to do training, we've sent department notices, telegrams, we've talked to directors and I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clinton, who is running for president, has defended using a personal email account while serving as secretary of state as a matter of personal convenience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She says she has turned over to the State Department all work-related emails, though House Republicans investigating the 2002 attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, are demanding more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They insist the server itself should be examined by a third party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Barr acknowledged problems with the State Department's overall record on responding to open records requests, calling an existing backlog of 18,000 requests "unacceptable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But she insisted improvements were being made even as the number of requests keeps growing and the agency is understaffed.</td></tr>
