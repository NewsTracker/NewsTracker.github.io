<h3>Rioting prompts state of emergency declaration in Baltimore</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A state of emergency has been declared in the U-S city of Baltimore to deal with violence that's engulfed it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A state of emergency has been declared in the US city of Baltimore to deal with violence that's engulfed it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At least 15 police officers have been injured responding to riots and looting that broke out after the funeral of an African American man who died in custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Thousands of National Guard troopers are being deployed to protect people and property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Stone-throwing mobs clashed with police, setting light to their vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rioters set a looted pharmacy alight, and repeatedly cut a fire hose as firefighters tried to contain the blaze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Baltimore Police's Colonel Darryl DeSousa says more than a dozen officers have been injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rioting broke out soon after 25-year-old Freddie Gray was buried, possibly spurred by a message on social media calling for random acts of lawlessness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The young African American man died 9 days ago having suffered a spinal injury following his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The family had asked that protests be put on hold while they mourned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But to their dismay riots broke out just a few blocks from the church where thousands of people attended his funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Having just a short time earlier delivered Mr Gray's eulogy, Reverend Jamal Bryant, found himself calling for the hundreds of mainly young African American rioters to get off the streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The family was very clear that this was a day of sacred closure in the funeral. So for us to come out of the burial and walk into this, is absolutely inexcusable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Maryland's Governor, Larry Hogan, has declared a State of Emergency, saying the National Guard will be deployed as soon as possible to restore order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"People have the right to protest and express their frustration. But Baltimore city families deserve peace and safety in their communities. And these acts of violence and destruction cannot and will not be tolerated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In addition Baltimore's mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, has imposed a curfew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It is very clear there is a difference between what we saw over the past week with the peaceful protests - those who wish to seek justice, those who wish to be heard and want answers. And the difference between those protests and the thugs who only want to incite violence and destroy our city."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The violence occurred less than 70 km from the nation's capital, where the country's new Attorney General was being sworn in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Loretta Lynch has made dealing with a string of deadly confrontations between mostly white police and black men, and the violence it has prompted, a high priority.</td></tr>
