<h3>Irving scores 24 to lead Cavaliers past Grizzlies 111-89 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Kyrie Irving scored 24 points, Kevin Love added 22 points and 10 rebounds, and the Cleveland Cavaliers rolled to a 111-89 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LeBron James finished with 20 points and Timofey Mozgov added 14 for Cleveland, which won its fourth straight and eighth in its last nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>J.R. Smith had 13 points for Cleveland, which shot 51 percent and was 14 of 34 from 3-point range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Marc Gasol led Memphis with 18 points, while Beno Udrih scored 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jeff Green had 11 points for Memphis, which had its three-game losing streak snapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The game was not in doubt after a big third quarter from the Cavaliers, extending the lead to as many as 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The 22-point loss was the biggest of the season at home for Memphis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cleveland controlled the boards with a 49-32 advantage in rebounds, which offset the Cavaliers' 18 turnovers, including five each by Love and Irving, compared to eight for Memphis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The game completely got away from Memphis in the third when Cleveland connected on 11 of its first 13 shots in the quarter, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That led to Cleveland outscoring Memphis 36-24 in the quarter, extending its 13-point halftime lead before holding a 91-66 advantage at the end of the third quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Cleveland lead was so substantial at the end of three that Memphis coach Dave Joerger left his starters on the bench for the final period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Cavaliers were able to convert because Memphis appeared to simply be going through the motions on both ends of the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Grizzlies' defense, which is among the best in the league, was virtually nonexistent as Cleveland converted on dunks and jumpers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On one play, James was so open in the corner, he was able to set himself, take a dribble and then shot without a defender challenging him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In a physical first half, the Cavaliers used 18 points from Irving and 13 from James to carry 55-42 lead into the break, Cleveland's largest lead of the half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There was a lot of banging under the basket as the Cavs tried to offset the bigger Memphis front-line duo of Gasol and Zach Randolph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Gasol managed 14 points in the half, but he and Randolph were a combined 7 of 20 from the field, part of Memphis shooting 40 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Randolph finished with only five points in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Cavaliers: The game was Cleveland's last in the regular season against a Western Conference opponent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>... The Cavaliers entered having lost the last five in Memphis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cleveland's last road win in the series was during the 2008-09 series.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>... Tony Allen connected on his 10th 3-pointer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He has made one in three of the last four games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>... Memphis recorded its 13th sellout of the season.</td></tr>
