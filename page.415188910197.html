<h3>Bali nine duo 'stoic' during heart-wrenching last moments in Kerobokan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bali: It was at 4am, in the cool humidity of Bali's predawn, when the guards opened the gates of "The Tower", the maximum-security wing of Kerobokan prison that has been the home of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for almost a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Both men were already awake, dressed and ready to go to Nusakambangan, the penal island that looks certain to be their final earthly destination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Indonesian police and security guard the fence of Ngurah Rai international airport during the transfer of Bali Nine duo Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was a moment, no doubt, that both men had been contemplating since they were first handed the death penalty some nine years ealier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to Komang Tri, from Bali's justice office, Chan seemed more settled than Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Andrew was doing fine. Myuran looked a bit pale. He looked like he was in a bit of daze," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sukumaran has been anxious for weeks, having difficulty sleeping at night, every bang and shout in the prison waking him with dread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chan's strong Christian faith - he was ordained as a minister in February - gives him certainty about his destiny in the afterlife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Wolf armoured vehicle carrying Bali nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran leaves Kerobokan Prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There were no histrionics from either, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both men remained calm and stoic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"They had already packed. We searched their belongings. It was all OK," said Mr Komang.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They were taken to a small administration centre in the prison, where the governor, Sujonggo, formally identified them and the final paperwork was processed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"They thanked the prison staff and said goodbye," said Nyoman Surya Putra Atmaja, the head of Bali corrections who was also at the prison for the transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Andrew Chan's girlfriend Febyanti Herewila and brother Michael Chan moments after Indonesian police refused their request to see Chan before his transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Indonesian language has many words for goodbye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Both men - reformed and popular with inmates and prison staff alike - used the term "pamit", denoting a final and irrevocable farewell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Their hands were shackled, but not their legs, and they were placed in a Wolf armoured personnel van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As they were being moved into the vehicle, Chan's brother Michael and his girlfriend, Febyanti Herewila, were frantically trying to meet Andrew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Chan, according to News Corp, had asked to be allowed to see Ms Herewila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Mr Atmaja denied there had been such a request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Febyanti Herewila and Andrew Chan's brother, Michael.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>leave Bali's Kerobokan prison after being refused a final visit before the transfer to Nusakambangan island last Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Either way, guards and officials blocked Mr Chan and Ms Herewila in a dramatic and heartbreaking scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Their presence at the door of the prison was not relayed, at least officially, to Andrew Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Soon after they left, the Wolf emerged from the prison and, accompanied by a Barracuda armoured vehicle and a convoy of police vehicles, headed to Denpasar airport soon after 5am for the trip to Cilacap, the port town near Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are only allowed to bring a small package of personal items - mostly clothing - with them to Nusakambagan, where they are to be killed by firing squad along with eight other drug felons in a mass execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Sukumaran was allowed to bring a drawing book and pencils, Chan took a treasured bible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The remainder of the belongings they have accumulated in "The Tower" have been given to other inmates, including three Bali nine members who remain in the penitentiary: Si Yi Chen, Matthew Norman and Michael Czugaj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Chen runs a silversmith and jewelry training course, Norman helps with English and computer classes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The last night of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran on death row in Kerobokan prison was spent like so many before - Chan prayed and counselled others, Sukumaran painted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Bali nine smuggling ring organisers had found out mid-afternoon on Tuesday that, after weeks of delays and misinformation, they would finally be heading to Nusakambangan the next day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Lawyer Julian McMahon spoke to both for several hours, briefing them on the unstinting legal and diplomatic efforts to save their lives, walking with Sukumaran around the prison grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>After he left, says a prison source, the men quietly began preparing for their final night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Myuran was painting and Andrew was praying and comforting others. They were both making sure everyone had the right things," said the source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Sukumaran - recently awarded a degree in fine arts from Curtin University - had already handed his most precious art books and canvases to his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>As well as painting, he spent his last night making final arrangements to ensure the art studio he founded continued to operate following his departure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Andrew said he wanted to know if he could talk to the [paramilitary police] guards who were taking him," said the source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"He was lovely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Christie Buckingham, a pastor from Bayside Church in Melbourne, was providing solace to the Chan and Sukumaran families in Australia on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"They are incredibly shaken," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The Sukumarans are en route to join Myuran's mother Raji in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Chan's mother Helen is also travelling to Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Both families will head straight to Cilacap, where they will be based as they spend their last precious moments with the duo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"We are still hoping that Indonesia will follow the process of law and just because they are being moved does not mean that this is definitely the end," said Reverend Buckingham.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>As for the fighter jets shadowing their plane, the armoured vehicles and the helicopter and hundreds of troops on standby in Cilacap airport for their arrival, Reverend Buckingham said it was completely unnecessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"It's just so absurd. Anyone who knows Andrew and Myu knows they are both so gentle. They would always go peacefully. They are men of integrity."</td></tr>
