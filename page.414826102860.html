<h3>Donald Trump dodges talk of Sarah Palin presidential race</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On the "Saturday Night Live" 40th Anniversary special on Sunday, Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, joked that she and The Donald might team up to seek the White House in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But at Monday's "Celebrity Apprentice" finale, Trump was asked about Mama Grizzly's comments - and he didn't exactly say "you betcha."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I thought I think she was I think she's a terrific person," stammered Trump when asked if he'd run with the former Alaska Governor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think she looked totally beautiful last night and everybody was talking about how beautiful she looked and I was honored by the skit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Trump flirted with running for the Republican nomination in 2000 and again in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In 2008, he went on "Larry King Live!" to endorse the McCain/Palin ticket, but declined to throw his own hat into the ring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>When asked if a Trump/Palin ticket could win the White House in 2016, once again The Donald was more concerned with Palin's aesthetic appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I have tremendous respect and I thought she did a really good job with the skit and I thought she looked really, really beautiful," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Trump did concede that being "really beautiful' doesn't hurt a candidate's chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Donald Trump said Sarah Palin looked 'really, really beautiful' at the 'SNL' 40th anniversary event Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Trump was equally evasive about who'd win at this weekend's Academy Awards showdown.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>"Geraldo is a great champion," he said of Rivera, who raised $146,000 against Gibbons' $324,000 on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In this case, Trump said the nice guy - or gal - finished first.</td></tr>
