<h3>At least 100 people may speak at James Holmes' sentencing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this June 4, 2013 file photo, Aurora theater mass shooter James Holmes, who was convicted on July 16, 2015, appears in court, in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At least 100 victims and witnesses of Holmes' deadly attack are expected to testify about the crime's profound and continuing impact on their lives during a formal sentencing hearing starting Monday, Aug. 24, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) - At least 100 victims and witnesses of James Holmes' deadly attack on a Colorado movie theater are expected to testify about the crime's profound and continuing impact on their lives during a formal sentencing hearing starting Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The three-day hearing gives survivors a chance to share their harrowing stories with the judge, but it won't change Holmes' sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jurors already determined that Holmes will spend the rest of his life in prison without parole for the July 20, 2012, attack that killed 12 people and injured 70 others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. will formally sentence Holmes to life on 24 counts of first-degree murder - two for each of those killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This week's testimony will help him determine Holmes' sentences on 141 other counts that include attempted murder and an explosives charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Samour has not set a limit on the number of people who can take the stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Many victims testified during Holmes' four-month trial about the terror and carnage he inflicted on more than 400 people who filled the seats at a sold-out midnight movie premiere of "The Dark Knight Rises" in suburban Aurora.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Holmes, a former graduate student in neuroscience, slipped into the darkened theater, threw gas canisters into the crowd and opened fire with a shotgun, assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Now, victims will be able to talk about the enduring harm he caused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They won't be able to address Holmes directly but rather the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Holmes will also have an opportunity to speak, though he declined to do so during his trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>State corrections officials will determine where Holmes will be incarcerated after an evaluation that includes his mental health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That could last up to 60 days, Department of Corrections spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Colorado prisons have an extensive mental health care system, and Holmes, who has been diagnosed with varying forms of schizophrenia, could wind up in the department's mental hospital, the 250-bed San Carlos Correctional Facility in Pueblo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The department has four levels of security for inmates, and those serving a life sentence, like Holmes, are usually classified at the highest or second-highest security level, Jacobson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She said she couldn't speculate on what kind of prison routine Holmes or any inmate would have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Holmes' attorneys blamed the massacre on his schizophrenia and psychotic delusions, and experts testified that it wouldn't have happened if he were not seriously mentally ill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Jurors quickly rejected his insanity defense, convicting him on July 16 of 165 felony counts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But they could not unanimously agree on the death penalty for Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After the trial, prosecutors said Holmes' fate ultimately came down to a single juror, who said she could not morally impose a death sentence after hearing testimony about Holmes' mental illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Aug. 7 verdict shocked many in the courtroom and the community, who assumed Holmes would pay with his life for one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.</td></tr>
