<h3>Iraqi forces recapture government headquarters in Tikrit from Isis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Iraqi forces cleared the government complex in Tikrit," an army major general said on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The government buildings have been under our control since last night (Monday)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It is the most significant advance in Tikrit since pro-government forces launched an operation to retake the city on 2 March, their largest since Isis led an offensive that overran much of the country's Sunni Arab heartland last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It leaves Isis in control of the north and east of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, said security forces and Popular Mobilisation units - pro-government paramilitary forces dominated by Iran-backed Shia militias - took part in the fighting, after some of those groups said they halted offensive operations in response to US-led air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Our security forces arrived at the centre of the city of Tikrit and freed the southern and western sides, and are moving to take control of the entire city," Abadi said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The provincial governor, Raad al-Juburi, confirmed that the government headquarters had been retaken, saying that Iraqi flags now flew over various recaptured buildings in the city.</td></tr>
