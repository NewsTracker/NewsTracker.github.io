<h3>New cancer fears in France over breast implants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The national cancer institute (INCa) said there had been 18 cases of the rare disease - anaplastic large cell lymphoma - since 2011, linked to the silicone breast implant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Given the rarity of the cases, the INCa said there was no need to recommend the removal of the implants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The country's health minister immediately sought to calm fears, with memories of faulty breast implants from the French firm PIP still fresh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We do not recommend that women carrying these implants have them removed," Marisol Touraine told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She urged women not to be "carried away by excessive worry" about the implants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The head of the INCa, Agnes Buzyn, said the increased detection rate could also be down to better screening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>No brand or type of implant has been specifically "called into question," insisted Touraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>According to Francois Hebert, deputy head of the drugs agency ANSM, around 400,000 women carry breast implants in France - 80 percent for aesthetic reasons and 20 percent as a result of breast cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>French firm PIP sparked a global health scare in 2011, when plastic surgeons began reporting an unusual number of ruptures in their products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The PIP implants were banned and the company eventually liquidated.</td></tr>

<h3>AP confuses Robert Durst? with Limp Bizkit?s Fred Durst</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Associated Press sparked a of Twitter memes and wisecracks on Monday - in their report on the arrest of millionaire accused murderer Robert - they mistakenly reported that inspiration for the HBO true-crime series "The Jinx" was "the former Limp Bizkit ," who is named Fred Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The Associated Press reported erroneously that Robert Durst is a member of a band," reads a correction issued by the AP on Tuesday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"He is a real estate heir; Fred Durst is the former frontman of Limp Bizkit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The AP's original error came on Monday evening, in the second paragraph of a story about drug charges filed against Robert Durst in New Orleans, according to Romenesko media blog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"A Louisiana State Police trooper says millionaire Robert Durst has been booked on weapons charges in that state - on top of a first-degree murder charge lodged by Los Angeles authorities," the first line of the paragraph reads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Trooper Melissa Matey told the Associated Press that an arrest warrant was issued for the former Limp Bizkit frontman and he was rebooked in the Orleans Parish Jail on Monday under two new charges."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A correction was only made after an AP spokesperson was asked to confirm the error, Romenesko reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And to make things even worse, Fred Durst, 44, is not even the former frontman for Limp Bizkit - he is STILL the nu-metal band's lead singer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He and his band shot to fame in the late 1990s with rock hits such as "Nookie," "Rollin" and "My Way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Robert Durst, on the other hand, is a 71-year-old millionaire and real estate mogul who admitted killing one man, but was acquitted, and is currently charged in the murder of a pal in California in connection to the disappearance of his first wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Robert Durst has finally been arrested, but Fred Durst has yet to answer for his crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The arrest of Robert Durst is raising awareness that it's still funny to make jokes about Fred Durst.</td></tr>
