<h3>NBA 2015-16 salary cap rises to all-time high of $70 million (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA salary cap was set Wednesday for next season at $70 million, a higher-than-expected number that paves the way for free agent contracts to be signed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The league said the cap increased by 11 percent from last season's $63.1 million and the 2015-16 cap will be the highest ever - though it will be shattered next summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It had been projected to come in closer to $67 million until recently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With the cap set, the league's moratorium will be lifted at midnight, and deals and trades that were agreed to since free agency opened on July 1 can become official beginning Thursday at 12:01 a.m. EDT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Also, the tax level increased 10.3 percent to $84.7 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Teams whose payrolls exceed it will be subjected to penalties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The salary cap is derived in part on league revenues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is expected to vault to about $90 million for the 2016-17 season, when the league's new national TV contracts begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the meantime, there's plenty of money for teams and players next season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Maximum salaries will rise, because they are based on a percentage of the cap, depending on a player's years of service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>LeBron James, should he sign for the max, would make $23 million next season with more than 10 years in the league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There will be three spending exceptions available to teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The non-taxpayer mid-level for this season is $5.5 million, the taxpayer mid-level is $3.4 million and the mid-level for a team with room under the salary cap is $2.8 million.</td></tr>
