<h3>Google Maps Now Shows You Everywhere You've Been</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This article, Google Maps now shows you everywhere you ve been, originally appeared on CNET.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google can show you a map of everywhere you ve been.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There s maybe a handful of people that know everywhere you go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Maybe it s your husband or wife, or your kid, if you regularly talk about your schedules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Oh and there s Google -- depending on how much you rely on its services, like Maps and its digital assistant Google Now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google on Tuesday announced a feature called Your Timeline that shows you everywhere you ve been on a map, tracking it by time and date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company is rolling out the feature gradually, first on the Web and for phones running Google s Android operating system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The company said the new feature is useful for remembering the places you ve been, like a fun bar you visited or the road trips you ve taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Your Timeline allows you to visualize your real-world routines," Gerard Sanz, a Google project manager, wrote in a blog post Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the feature is also a reminder of how much data Google collects on its users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The company, which makes the bulk of its money on advertising, lives on knowing personal information about the people who use its services -- like where they ve been or what they ve searched for online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Privacy advocates have criticized the company for already knowing too much about its users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Google is quick to point to privacy controls for the feature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A user can delete anything from their timeline, including a day s worth of location data, as well as the entire timeline itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>People can also edit and personalize names of places on the map (like Mom s house), or turn off location tracking services altogether.</td></tr>
