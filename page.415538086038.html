<h3>Guinea Ebola cases rise; three doctors infected</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The outbreak, which began in eastern Guinea more than a year ago and has killed over 10,000 people in the three West African countries worst hit, had appeared to be on the wane, but Guinea has seen cases rise for three consecutive weeks, according to World Health Organization data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A government health report from the weekend showed there were 21 new cases in a single day, a spike from the recent daily average of eight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>President Alpha Conde said on Tuesday that everything must be done to end the outbreak by mid-April, ahead of a meeting with donors scheduled around that date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ending Ebola could reboot Guinea's mining-dependent economy that has been hammered by the outbreak, which has scared investors, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"With Ebola, it is easier to go from 100 cases to 10 cases than from 10 cases & to zero. To end it, we need 10 times more effort than when the outbreak was at its height," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A big source of concern is a chain of new infections that can be linked back to a woman who died of Ebola and was not buried safely, according to Fatoumata Lejeune-Kaba, spokeswoman for the U.N.'s Ebola emergency response mission UNMEER.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's a major setback. & It's due to individual behaviors. That is having a devastating effect on the community. People are simply not practicing the safety rules that we have been talking about for a year," she told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Of the other two countries worst hit, Sierra Leone has also seen a spate of new cases, while Liberia has no known cases at present and is waiting to be declared free of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The new cases in Guinea are in the capital and the southwestern town of Forecariah but if the situation is not brought under control they could spread across borders, said Lejeune-Kaba.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Guinea officials said the new cases came from high-risk Ebola contacts who had left Forecariah and developed symptoms elsewhere, pointing to poor surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sakoba Keita, Guinea's anti-Ebola task force coordinator, said on Tuesday that the government was putting in place new measures, including strict rules regulating the movement of corpses and contact tracing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There are numerous gaps in the Ebola response in Guinea, notably in surveillance of contacts, and that explains the difficulty in making any lasting progress towards ending the epidemic," said a spokesman for medical charity MSF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The three doctors were infected at the Ignace Deen hospital in Conakry, which is not an Ebola center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>More than 50 doctors in Guinea have caught the virus during the outbreak.</td></tr>

<h3>Police: 3 Football Players Stabbed in Fight at Morgan State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two groups of people got into a fight outside a dining hall on the Morgan State University campus, and some football players were stabbed by someone swinging a knife wildly, police and college officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a March 17 story about stabbings at Morgan State University, The Associated Press, relying on information provided by the Baltimore Police Department, reported erroneously that three people were stabbed on the campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police spokesman Detective Ruganzu Howard now says two people were stabbed and a third was not injured by a knife but suffered abrasions in the incident.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Two groups of people got into a fight Tuesday outside a dining hall on the Morgan State University campus, and two football players were stabbed by someone swinging a knife wildly, police and college officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was the third instance of violence on the Baltimore campus in less than a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The players were taken to hospitals and their injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A third person was not injured by a knife but suffered abrasions in the incident, police spokesman Detective Ruganzu Howard said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A suspect was taken into custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's not clear what started the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This is the third instance of recent violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Friday, a male student was stabbed with scissors by his roommate after an argument over the cleanliness of their dorm room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Early Saturday, an on-campus party was broken up after fights started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>School officials held a campus meeting Tuesday night to talk about what happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We expect you as students to take responsibility for your own behavior and actions," University president David Wilson told those in attendance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earlier Tuesday, Wilson sent an email to students that declared "This is not Morgan!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Kevin Banks, vice president for student affairs, repeated that assertion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The stuff you've seen on TV the past few days is not Morgan State University," Banks said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Wilson also said no text alerts were sent to students immediately after the stabbing because "the general public was not in imminent danger because this was a fight between known parties and not a random act of violence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But Freshman Shakia Marine, 20, who did not attend the campus meeting, said she is a little worried about the latest spate of violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"My godfather has concerns about me coming here," Marine said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"There needs to be more security guards walking around. After today, it made me feel scared. My roommate said we should get some Mace to protect ourselves. I think the school needs to take more action. It's not the first time something like this has happened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Morgan State is the largest historically black university in Maryland and has about 6,000 students, according to its website.</td></tr>
