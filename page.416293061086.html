<h3>Clinton to name former financial regulator as CFO: Bloomberg</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton plans to name Gary Gensler, a former financial regulator who pushed for stricter oversight of Wall Street, as the chief financial officer for her presidential campaign, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clinton blasted executive pay and tax rates for hedge-fund managers this week on the first stop of her campaign rollout in Iowa to highlight her promise to help Americans struggling toward economic recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bloomberg cited in its report an unnamed Democrat familiar with the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gensler, whose five-year term as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ended in January 2014, came to embody President Barack Obama's push for Wall Street reforms in the trillion-dollar derivatives market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A one-time Goldman Sachs swaps trader, he transformed the watchdog from a relatively sleepy agriculture-focused regulator to a powerful overseer of Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He proved a polarizing figure with his aggressive interpretation of swaps reforms after the financial crisis, irritating both Wall Street and international counterparts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"There is something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here over the last two days," Clinton said in Monticello, Iowa, on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton, considered the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination next year, announced her candidacy last Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Reuters could not immediately reach Gensler for comment.</td></tr>
