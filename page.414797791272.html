<h3>Sierra Leone promises probe into Ebola spending</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The audit report first emerged in Sierra Leone's parliament last week, detailing how some $5.75 million in funds either had no or insufficient documentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That represents about a third of the total $19.32 million under review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a statement released Monday, the government pledged a full investigation, and said the matter also would be debated in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Government wishes to make it abundantly clear that those who are found guilty of misusing Ebola funds will face the full force of the law," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The report by Sierra Leone's Auditor General covered the months of May through October 2014, and looked at donations received directly by the government to fight Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is clear from our audit conducted that there continue to be lapses in the financial management system in Sierra Leone and these have ultimately resulted in the loss of funds and a reduction in the quality of service delivery in the health sector," the report stated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>More than 3,300 people have died from Ebola with nearly 11,000 cases over the past year in Sierra Leone, where transmission remains the highest in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As Ebola is being brought under control, Sierra Leone plans to re-open its schools at the end of March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Neighboring Liberia reported just five confirmed Ebola cases last week and it reopened most of its schools Monday.</td></tr>
