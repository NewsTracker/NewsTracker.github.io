<h3>Corruption allegations over Bali Nine trial sets Australia-Indonesia row</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SYDNEY/JAKARTA, April 27 (Reuters) - Australia made a last-minute plea on Monday for a stay in the imminent execution of two Australian drug traffickers in Indonesia, saying that reports their trial had been tainted by corruption needed to be investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The call from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop almost immediately deepened a diplomatic row with Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bishop said the allegations that judges requested money to commute the death sentences for the pair were "very serious" and called into question the integrity of the sentencing process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Indonesia's foreign ministry hit back, saying Australia needed to show proof of alleged corruption and questioned why concerns were being only raised now instead of 10 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Armanatha Nasir, spokesman for Indonesia's foreign ministry, said Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan have been given all the legal avenues to challenge their death sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The two are among nine drug convicts, including others from Brazil and Nigeria, due to be executed by firing squad as soon as Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Bali-based lawyer Muhammad Rifan told the Sydney Morning Herald that he had agreed to pay judges in the cases of Chan and Sukumaran more than A$130,000 ($101,647) to give them a prison term of less than 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rifan said the deal fell through when the judges told him they had been ordered by senior legal and government members in Jakarta to impose a death penalty and he didn't have enough money to meet a revised, higher demand for a lighter sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's a matter for Indonesia's Judicial Commission to investigate these matters and that underlines why we continue to request Indonesia to allow the judicial commission to finalise its review," Bishop told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"An execution is an irrevocable step and I believe that these hearings and these appeal processes should be concluded before any decision is taken."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rifan could not be reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Indonesia's Judicial Commission said it would look into reports alleging corruption but said its findings would have no bearing on their cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have received a report on that, we have it in our file now, but we have not yet made any decision," Commissioner Taufiqqurahman Syahuri told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But even if it is proven that the judge violated ethical codes, it won't affect the court's earlier decision. We cannot annul a decision from a court, such a thing can only be done by a higher court. What has been decided is final. The Judicial Commission can punish the judge, but ethical and legal matters are different."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Indonesia informed the two Australians at the weekend they would be executed in a matter of days, possibly as soon as Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Bishop criticised Indonesia over its insensitive handling of the announcement on a day when Australians remember their war dead, particularly poignant this year given the 100th anniversary of what is now known as ANZAC Day that marks the start of a doomed World War One campaign in Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We did make representations to request that they not do this on our national day of remembrance, but they proceeded with the meeting in any event," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I'm very disappointed that it proceeded in this way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Bishop said it was not too late for President Joko Widodo to stay the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Again, I respectfully call on president Widodo to reconsider his refusal to grant clemency," Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"It is not too late for a change of heart."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Indonesia has harsh punishments for drug crimes and resumed executions in 2013 after a five-year gap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Six executions have been carried out so far this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are among a group of seven death row drug convicts who received notices from the Attorney General's office on Saturday that they would face a firing squad after 72 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Australia is continuing to lobby on behalf of Chan and Sukumaran, the ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the main airport on the holiday island of Bali in 2005 for trying to smuggle 8 kg (17.6 lb) of heroin to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The other members of the gang, all Australians, have been jailed for between 18 years and life in Indonesia.</td></tr>
