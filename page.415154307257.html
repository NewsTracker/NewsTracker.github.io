<h3>Lawyers deny video of Boston Marathon bomber exists</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The stunning assertion comes just two days before Tsarnaev, 21, goes on trial in Boston on federal capital murder charges stemming from the deadly April 15, 2013 attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"That does not exist," defense attorney David Bruck said at a pre-trial hearing in Boston Federal Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Shortly after Tsarnaev arrest in a shootout that left him wounded, FBI officials touted the gotcha video in a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The feds claimed the video, which was never made public, showed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev dropping a backpack concealing a homemade bomb next to a 6-year-old boy who was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the time, FBI officials only released still photos of Tsarnaev mingling with finish-line revelers near where little Martin Richard was standing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Other photos made public showed both Tsarnaev brothers walking through the crowd before the explosions carrying backpacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two other people were killed and more than 160 were injured when two explosives made from pressure cookers ignited near the finish line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Opening arguments in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial are set to begin on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His defense team previewed its plan to show that Tamerlan Tsarnaev mastermind and executed the twin bombings at one of the country's most iconic sporting events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Without his brother, Tamerlan, "the Boston Marathon bombing would never have occurred," Bruck said in court Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shoot-out with police days after the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is also facing charges that he and his brother murdered Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier, 26, while on the run from authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>If convicted, Dzhokhar faces the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Defense attorneys told Judge George O'Toole Monday that they want jurors to see the bullet-riddled boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in the Boston suburb of Watertown, Mass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Prosecutors countered they only want to bring in a bullet-pocked panel from the boat where Tsarnaev scribbled what investigators claim is a "confession."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He wrote the attack was revenge for the U.S. military's action in Afghanistan and Iraq, and called the Boston bombing victims "collateral damage."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"When you attack one Muslim you attack all Muslims," Tsarnaev's note read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Bruck argued that showing the entire boat would give jurors a better understanding of Tsarnaev's state of mind when he wrote the message.</td></tr>
