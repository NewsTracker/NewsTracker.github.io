<h3>Apple finally acknowledges women exist</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OPINION: WHILE Apple unveiled its plan to dominate the online music streaming world today, it also introduced a feature that will make the lives of Apple's female users just that little bit easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook (centre) poses for a photo with high school kids during Apple WWDC in San Francisco.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>WHILE Apple unveiled its plan to dominate the online music streaming world today, it also introduced a feature that will make the lives of Apple's female users just that little bit easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple is finally acknowledging that periods exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The iOS9 software update, which won't be available until the next iPhone comes out, will include a period tracker that charts both frequency and flow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>When the Apple Health app launched in January year with the iOS8 software update, there was a glaring omission from the range of bodily function it monitored - women couldn't track their menstrual cycles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A side note: if you're not already using your iPhone's Health app, you should be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's the white icon with a pink love heart and you can track your weight, calories in and out, your sleep and your body temperature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's fab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Get on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There are already loads of apps that help you monitor your period (Period Diary and Period Tracker are the App Store's most popular).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But it seems pretty bad to create a super detailed health app that excludes half the population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But as The Verge asks, "what about cramps and fertility? Will it be able to alert users about an upcoming period?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>We'll have to wait and see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Apple also tried to improve their tainted pro-women image by allowing not one, but two female executives to speak during one of its famous keynote presentations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>How revolutionary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Vice president of Apple Pay, Jennifer Bailey, discussed the company's progress in mobile payments and Susan Prescott explained Apple's forthcoming News app at Apple's World Wide Developers Conference in San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This is the first time female executives have made an onstage appearance during an Apple keynote presentation since 2010, when Zynga's Jen Herman introduced Farmville, Bloomberg reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In an interview with Mashable on the weekend, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged the company needs to do more for gender equality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>70 per cent of Apple's staff are male.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I think it's our fault - 'our' meaning the whole tech community," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I think in general we haven't done enough to reach out and show young women that it's cool to do it and how much fun it can be."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Cook acknowledges Apple needs to give women more female role models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I think mostly people look up and see, 'you know, I'm like that person and I see what they can do,'" Cook said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Two women on a stage and a period app function isn't much, but it's a start.</td></tr>
