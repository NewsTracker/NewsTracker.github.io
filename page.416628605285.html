<h3>Bali nine duo's last wish - renewed global push to abolish the death penalty</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran wanted their legacy to be a renewed push across the globe to abolish the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Their long-time lawyer Julian McMahon revealed the desire as he disclosed new details about their final minutes, including that Chan made a roll call of the other prisoners to ensure they were okay just moments before they were shot dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bodies of the two reformed drug smugglers are due to return home on Friday at about 9.30am, transported by Indonesia's national carrier Garuda Airlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Along with the families, Chan's new wife Febyanti Herewila will also travel to Australia for the men's funerals, expected to be held next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr McMahon said the duo wanted people "to care enough about what has happened to do something about the death penalty".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They would be pleased there was so much publicity around their death because they want their death to have some purpose and meaning far greater than the story being just about them. They want to help other prisoners on death row in other places."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr McMahon was on Nusakambangan penal island when the men were shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>From conversations with those who witnessed their deaths, the lawyer confirmed the two Australians led the singing of hymns and comforted the other men to be executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Andrew did a roll call, checking each one, that everyone was okay, and they were all okay," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That included the Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, who was mentally ill and in the hours before his death finally seemed to realise his life was to end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Indonesia-based priest Father Charlie Burrows told Irish radio that, as he was leaving his cell, Gularte said "Am I being executed?".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I said 'yes, I thought I had been explaining that to you'," Father Burrows told RTE radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr McMahon also said the men were reading books about the Gallipoli campaign and the famous WW1 general Sir John Monash in their last days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Their reading material was bitterly ironic - the pair found out that their executions would occur in 72 hours on Anzac Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Two of the eight men executed on Wednesday morning were buried later that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The only Indonesian among the condemned, Zainal Abidin, was buried in a ceremony in Cilacap, the port town across the narrow strait from Nusakambangan, where the eight men were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Zainal wanted to be buried in his home town of Palembang in South Sumatra but his request was denied by local authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It is understood they did not want to pay for the transfer of his remains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Zainal comes from an impoverished background and the only relative to attend the service was his brother Iwan Setiawan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Everything is over. My brother has been buried. What else can we do? May God forgive all his sins," Iwan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Nigerian drug dealer Okwudili Oyatanze was laid to rest at the Gita Eklesia Foundation's orphanage in Ambarawa, near the Central Java city of Semarang.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Oyatanze was orphaned at seven months and had a harsh upbringing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rina, the owner of the orphanage, told the Jakarta Post she often visited Oyatanze in prison and took children from the centre to meet him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The children here felt close to him," she told the newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Dili", as he was affectionately known, was frequently likened to Chan and Sukumaran for his leadership role in prison, and his impact on the lives of other convicts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Upon its arrival at the orphanage, his body was greeted by a sign emblazoned "Welcome Home, Uncle Dili", local media reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mr McMahon said all those who had been executed were fine people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"They were beautiful, wonderfully composed people. The manner in which they dealt with their families, girlfriends and children simply was a great privilege to observe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"The idea of killing those people as they sat there radiating warmth and love it exposes the complete and absolute futility of the state sponsored killing of prisoners."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Bali executions: Eight prisoners refused to wear...</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Bali 9 executions more perfect, says Indonesia's...</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>'Am I being executed?' Schizophrenic Brazilian...</td></tr>
