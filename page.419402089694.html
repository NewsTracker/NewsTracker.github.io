<h3>Google expands low-cost phone program in 6 African countries</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) " Google is introducing a low-priced smartphone in six African countries where most people still can't afford an Internet-connected device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The phone announced Tuesday is made by Infinix and will cost about $87.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It will be sold in stores in Nigeria and offered by online retailer Jumia in five other countries: Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, and Morocco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Infinix worked with Google on the "Hot 2" phone as part of a program called Android One that made its debut in India last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Android One represents Google's push to lower the prices of smartphones in less developed parts of the world where computers are considered a luxury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google consults with device makers to build cheap phones that can still run the latest version of its Android software.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Infinix's phone will be sold with an Android release that came out last year under the nickname "Lollipop."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It will be capable of running the next upgrade of Android, called "Marshmallow," due out this fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The price for the Hot 2 is a steep markdown from other smartphones equipped with Android's newest software.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For instance, prices for Samsung Electronics newest Android phones to be released this month will cost from about $700 to more than $800 without a wireless contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Android phones being released in Africa, though, are bare-bones models that can't do as many things as more expensive phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Google, Facebook and other Internet companies are trying to get more people online in places like Africa so they can expand their audiences and eventually sell more digital advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As part of that effort, Google already has built a fiber-optic network to provide faster Internet access in Kampala, the capital of Uganda.</td></tr>
