<h3>Russia cuts off power supplies to Ukraine rebels: Kiev</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Russia had cut off electricity to Ukraine's rebel-run regions, Kiev said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>KIEV: Kiev said on Tuesday that Russia had cut off electricity to Ukraine's rebel-run regions in what appears to be another sign that Moscow is losing interest in plans to splinter its neighbour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin has gone through an extended spell without peppering his speeches with mentions of a "New Russia" (Novorossiya) made up of Ukrainian lands that were once under tsarist control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The veteran Kremlin leader had fervently promoted the project while the separatists were gaining ground along Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland toward the end of last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Ukrainian insurgents who claimed to be in charge of re-creating a part of the old Russian empire have in recent weeks complained of a sudden lack of interest from the Kremlin and a dire shortage of funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ukraine's Energy Minister Volodymyr Demchyshyn said Tuesday that energy-rich Russia had recently also stopped supplying electricity to the militia-run regions of Lugansk and Donetsk because bills were not being paid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We held fairly productive negotiations with the Russians," Interfax-Ukraine quoted Demchyshyn as telling an energy ministry meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We have been able to switch off four lines that ran from Russia to territories outside our control."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The energy minister said the cables supplied an allowance of $15 million (14 million euros) of power a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"That money was not being paid," Demchyshyn said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There was no immediate response to his comments from either Moscow or the rebels themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Their 15-month revolt against Kiev's new pro-Western position saw the rebels carve out a region about the size of Wales that is home to 3.5 million people and shares a 500-kilometre (300-mile) border with Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But much of the region remains a ghost of its proud image as the economic driving engine of the former Soviet Union's second-largest state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Most of the coal mines and steel mills have been either shuttered or cannot operate because of chronic shortages of electricity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kiev policy hawks such as Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk have also pushed through a raft of measures designed to erect a punitive "economic blockade" of rebel-run territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Yatsenyuk ordered Ukraine's power suppliers to halt all deliveries to the separatists on May 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Natural gas flows from the rest of Ukraine to the east have also been significantly lowered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Russia had earlier promised to make up for the shortage by building extensions and branches to existing gas pipelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It remains unclear where those plans stand on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Demchyshyn's comments came ahead of a new round of negotiations Tuesday in the Belarussian capital Minsk aimed at ending a conflict that has claimed more than 6,500 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Efforts to stop the fighting seem locked in stalemate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The EU-mediated meeting will see Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's personal envoy speak to the Moscow-appointed negotiator in the presence of separatist representatives who are not formally part of the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Kiev said on Tuesday that Russia had cut off electricity to Ukraine's rebel-run regions in what appears to be another sign that Moscow is losing interest in plans to splinter its neighbour.</td></tr>
