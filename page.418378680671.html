<h3>Microsoft to cut 7,800 jobs as phone sales sag</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Microsoft will cut 7,800 jobs and take a US$7.6 billion impairment charge as it attempts to revive its flagging phone hardware business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new cuts come on top of the 18,000 jobs that were trimmed last year and just over a year after the company made an aggressive push into the smartphone market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The company paid $7.3 billion for Nokia's phone business in April 2014, seeking to push rapidly into the smartphone sphere as its traditional software business slowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Microsoft ultimately wanted to build an ecosystem that created customers that were loyal to a slew of its products, much as Apple and Google have done so successfully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Microsoft's Windows Phone system has gained little traction against Apple's iPhone and Google's Android system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Now the company says it will write down more than the entire cost of buying Nokia in the fourth quarter and also take a $750 million to $850 million restructuring charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem including our first-party device family," CEO Satya Nadella said in a printed statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Nokia deal was made under Nadella's predecessor Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to make its own smartphones and tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Nadella has been moving away from this strategy in order to focus on the company's core software business and related services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Last year, he announced a broad restructuring including cutting the 18,000 jobs, the biggest round of layoffs in the company's history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>About half of those, 12,500, were jobs associated with the Nokia unit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Other recent moves include handing off some its digital advertising business to AOL and selling its street-image mapping operation to Uber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>FBR analyst Daniel Ives said the cuts will be painful, but are necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We believe Nadella's proactive approach at cleaning up the Nokia acquisition is a positive 'tipping of the hand' around Microsoft's future focus on software (versus hardware) as the company heads into a pivotal year, with Windows 10 front and center as a major product catalyst," Ives said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 10, is scheduled to be released on July 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Microsoft said it will give more details when it reports fourth-quarter earnings on July 21.</td></tr>
