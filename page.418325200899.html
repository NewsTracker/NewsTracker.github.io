<h3>FIFA bans former 2018-2022 WCup inspector for 7 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The official chosen by FIFA to inspect 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting candidates was banned from soccer for seven years on Monday for breaking ethics rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA's ethics committee gave no reason for its decision to suspend Harold Mayne-Nicholls, a former president of Chile's football federation who is disputing the sanction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I will appeal to higher courts established in FIFA statutes and TAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport)," Mayne-Nicholls said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I wonder why FIFA publishes a sanction that has outstanding resources, as this may be modified by higher courts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mayne-Nicholls said the ethics committee prohibited him from speaking about the details of the case in public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He has previously spoken to some media about conversations he had in 2010 with officials in Qatar about possible work placements for relatives at the Aspire youth academy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Details of that case were also published by a website last year, which obtained a leaked e-mail sent to Mayne-Nicholls by Cornel Borbely, who heads the investigation chamber of FIFA's ethics committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mayne-Nicholls was considering standing in the FIFA presidential election when his ethics case was reported last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Instead, he is barred "from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level for a period of seven years," the ethics panel said in a brief statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>FIFA ethics judge Joachim Eckert chaired the panel which conducted a personal hearing for Mayne-Nicholls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Eckert's statement said "more detailed information will be given after this final decision becomes effective."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Challenges to FIFA's appeals committee and subsequently to CAS typically take around one year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mayne-Nicholls was appointed by FIFA in 2010 to lead a six-member team evaluating the 2018-2022 World Cup bidders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>All nine candidates were visited between July and September 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In the technical report, Mayne-Nicholls flagged eventual winners Russia and Qatar as presenting the most risk to FIFA as potential host nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The FIFA executive committee largely ignored his report, and a FIFA-commissioned analysis of the commercial prospects for each bidder's World Cup project, in a December 2010 vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mayne-Nicholls was voted out of office in Chile soon after completing his task for FIFA.</td></tr>
