<h3>Icahn says 'dramatically undervalued' Apple should trade at $240</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Billionaire activist-investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York February 11, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on Monday Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) stock was "still dramatically undervalued" and that it should be trading at $240, nearly double its current price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Icahn also used an open letter to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to call for it to execute a much larger share buyback, returning to a longtime theme of the activist investor's campaign for the iPhone maker to boost shareholder returns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple shares rose as much as 1.8 percent to $130.72 by midday on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The stock has gained more than a quarter since October, when Icahn first said it was undervalued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Following pressure from Icahn and other activists, Apple boosted its share repurchase program in April to $140 billion from $90 billion announced last year and raised its quarterly dividend by 11 percent to 52 cents per share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It is our belief that large institutional investors, Wall Street analysts and the news media alike continue to misunderstand Apple," Icahn wrote in the letter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Icahn, one of Apple's top 10 investors, has long urged the world's most valuable company to buy back more shares and boost its dividend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The investor said in February that he owned about 53 million shares, now worth about $6.8 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Apple is poised to enter and in our view dominate two new categories (the television next year and the automobile by 2020) with a combined addressable market of $2.2 trillion, a view investors don't appear to factor into their valuation at all," Icahn wrote on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple has yet to officially acknowledge that it is developing what would likely be an electric, self-driving car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It has also long been expected to enter the consumer television market with a more wide-ranging product than its current Apple TV box that allows users to stream programs from iTunes and other sources, but has said little about those plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Past expectations that Apple would develop an actual television have so far been disappointed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Apple had decided more than a year earlier that it would not make a television set, Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It is unclear how much insight Icahn has into the iPhone maker's plans for future products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An Apple spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Icahn was not immediately available for comment by phone.</td></tr>
