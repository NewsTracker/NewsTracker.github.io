<h3>New Mexico Senate approves $6.2 billion budget bill</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Senators voted 38-3 on a budget bill largely unchanged from what the House of Representatives approved last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It's the best we could do with what we have," said Sen. John Arthur Smith, D-Deming, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In approving the budget plan last week and sending it to a vote of the full Senate, the panel slightly rearranged appropriations for health and human services and public schools, and restored cuts in higher education, among other tweaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The spending plan - which now heads back to the House for concurrence - includes pay raises for new teachers and state police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Most department budgets remain flat, but education, the state's child welfare agency, public safety, tourism and economic development get more money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Legislators have had to pare down spending plans because of plunging oil prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An August forecast pegged new revenues at about $285 million, which dropped to half that in December, then to $83 million last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We certainly hope that oil prices will turn around," Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We're moving ahead precariously."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sen. Carroll Leavell, R-Jal, also a member of the finance committee, said the state has adequate reserves that he hopes it doesn't have to dip in to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The oil and gas industry is the backbone of our budget, and the falling prices are having a tremendous impact," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gov. Susana Martinez and lawmakers have highlighted education as a priority with some of the lowest performing schools in the nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The bill calls for a $37 million bump for education initiatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Both laid out plans in January - based on revenue projections available then - to spend an additional $70 million or so on education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But with less new money available because of falling oil prices, the bill calls for a $37 million bump for learning initiatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Adopting a budget is a must-do assignment for lawmakers before the session adjourns Saturday.</td></tr>
