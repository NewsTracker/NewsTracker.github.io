<h3>Hillary Clinton says US-Israel relationship needs to return to 'constructive footing'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S.-Israeli relationship needs to return to "constructive footing," according to a prominent Jewish leader who spoke to the former secretary of state during the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton said the U.S. and Israel need to get back to shared concerns and interests, including a negotiated two-state solution, according to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Secretary Clinton thinks we need to all work together to return the special US-Israel relationship to constructive footing," the group's executive vice chairman, Malcolm Hoenlein, said in the statement quoting Clinton's comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The statement concluded: "We must ensure that Israel never becomes a partisan issue."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton has avoided publicly discussing American relations with Israel in recent weeks, which have been strained by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's opposition to Palestinian statehood and a late campaign warning that Arab voters were heading to the polls "in droves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu has backtracked his statements but the White House said it had hurt prospects of negotiating a two-state solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton has longstanding ties to Netanyahu, who first served as prime minister during the second term of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hillary Clinton wrote in her latest book that Netanyahu was a "complicated figure" who was skeptical of a two-state solution giving Palestinians their own country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a 2014 interview, Clinton said she had maintained a good relationship with Netanyahu "in part because we can yell at each other, and we do. And I was often the designated yeller."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill confirmed that she spoke with Hoenlein by phone on Sunday but declined to elaborate.</td></tr>
