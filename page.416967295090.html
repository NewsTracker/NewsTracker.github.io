<h3>Facebook pushes to improve benefits, pay for contractors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Facebook is pushing for higher pay and improved benefits for the janitors, cooks and other workers who support its employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The world's largest online social network is implementing a set of new standards for its U.S.-based contractors who do a "substantial amount of work" with Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, announced the changes in a blog post late Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new standards include a minimum wage of $15 an hour, at least 15 paid days off per year, and for those who don't receive paid parental leave, a $4,000 "new child benefit" for new parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The move comes amid a nationwide push to pay low-wage workers at least $15 per hour and improve other benefits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In Silicon Valley, where the wealth gap between tech industry luminaries and the workers who serve their lunches and clean their bathroom can be especially jarring, the movement has focused on tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook had originally planned to announce the changes last Monday, as the standards are already in place for some workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The announcement was delayed following the sudden death of Sandberg's husband, David Goldberg, on May 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Taking these steps is the right thing to do for our business and our community," wrote Sandberg, who returned to work at Facebook this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Women, because they comprise about two-thirds of minimum wage workers nationally, are particularly affected by wage adjustments. Research also shows that providing adequate benefits contributes to a happier and ultimately more productive workforce."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sandberg said the new standards were put in place May 1 for "some of our largest support teams" at the company's headquarters and the company is planning to implement it with a broader set of U.S. vendors this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The new standards won't apply to Facebook's shuttle bus drivers, who voted to unionize earlier this year with the Teamsters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rome Aloise, international vice president for Teamsters Local 853, said the starting wage in their contracts already exceeds $15 per hour, as does paid time off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But I do think that Facebook is exhibiting themselves to be responsible corporate citizens," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"(We're) hoping the rest of the tech companies will follow their lead."</td></tr>
