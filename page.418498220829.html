<h3>Nigeria investigating Boko Haram attack in remote northeast</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At least 43 people were killed in attacks by Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamic extremists in a remote region in the country's northeast, according to police and residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attacks happened Friday on the villages of Kalwa, Misala and Gwollam and people were either shot dead or stabbed, said Aderemi Opadokun, Borno state police commissioner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At least 43 people were killed in the villages Friday night, said Haruna Bukar, a civilian security agent in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officials say more such killings may be unreported because poor communication links to the remote parts of Borno state make it difficult for authorities to get news from the area.</td></tr>
