<h3>Alex Morgan lands FIFA 16 video game cover</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Carli Lloyd may be the best women's soccer player in the world right now, but Alex Morgan remains the face of the sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That much was made clear when the U.S. National Team star landed the cover of EA Sports' popular soccer video game - a first for a female athlete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I'm so honored to be featured on the cover of #FIFA16. Thank you @EASPORTSFIFA!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Morgan wrote to her two million Twitter followers shortly after Monday's announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The forward will appear in the official artwork for the U.S. version of FIFA 16 alongside Argentina and Barcelona phenom Lionel Messi, a three-time FIFA Ballon d'Or and World Soccer Player of the Year winner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I'm so honored to be featured on the cover of #FIFA16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Morgan's individual achievements include U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year and CONCACAF Player of the Year awards in 2012 and 2013, but it's her image more than anything that has catapulted the 26-year-old to international superstardom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Earlier this month, a FIFA.com article profiling Morgan suggested as much by highlighting the player's "good looks" while describing her as "nothing short of a media phenomenon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lloyd, however, was the main force behind Team USA's recent Women's World Cup victory, sharing Golden Boot honors with Germany's Celia !ic thanks to her six goals - including a 16-minute hat-trick in a 5-2 blowout win over Japan in the tournament final.</td></tr>
