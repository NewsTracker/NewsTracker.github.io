<h3>CIA chief announces sweeping reorganization of US spy agency</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Brennan announced the restructuring to the CIA workforce on Friday, including a new directorate devoted to boosting the CIA's computer hacking skills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the move comes after nine agency officers spent three months analyzing its management structure, including what deputy CIA director David Cohen called "pain points," organizational areas where the CIA's bureaucracy does not work efficiently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Briefing reporters with Cohen at CIA headquarters this week, Brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the CIA is not covering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He lamented that there is often no single person he can hold accountable for the spying mission in any given part of the world.</td></tr>
