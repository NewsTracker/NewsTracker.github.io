<h3>Apple iOS 9 now available as part of public beta</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>No need to wait: Apple's iOS 9 could be on your iPad and iPhone early if you're happy to take the risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For the first time, Apple is making a major update to its iPhone and iPad software available to everyone before its official release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The iOS 9 public beta was launched on Friday, and anybody hankering for a glance at the future of mobile Apple products can sign up at the beta website and then grab the software through iTunes, although you should do so with caution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The whole purpose of a beta is to help Apple refine the release and fix any bugs, so while it won't cause your device to explode there could be niggles or serious issues that necessitate a factory reset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple suggests you only install this software on a secondary device, not on the iPhone you rely on every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As always with betas, if you are planning to live dangerously and install the beta on a main device (or even a secondary one), make sure you back up before the install and periodically afterwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This way you don't have to waste half a day setting up your device all over again if something goes wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A proper tethered backup with the "encrypt this backup" box checked is best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the past Apple has run public betas for incremental updates (the last time being for iOS 8.3), but this is the first time those outside the developer community have been allowed to test a major overhaul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For those who only have one iOS device or are happy to wait, the full iOS 9 release is expected to launch alongside new, as-yet-unannounced iPhones later in the year (middle of September, if history is any indication).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple is also running a public beta for the next version of its desktop software, OS X El Capitan, which was showcased alongside iOS 9 earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple iOS 9 now available as part of public beta Hands on review: Samsung SUHD Full Array Ultra HD television Google's surreal 'DeepDream' image algorithm goes viral Facebook gives you more control over your news feed with 'see first' option Why do movies look so fake on my new HDTV?</td></tr>
