<tr><td>8</td><td>Some break bricks with sledgehammers, some build small walls with bricks under a building's exposed foundation, which has been partially stabilized with wood and cement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A generator runs noisily with cords snaking into the narrow passageways where others labor with tools and other machinery to search for any additional survivors.</td></tr>
