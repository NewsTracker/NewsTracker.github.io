<h3>Strong quake rattles Greek capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - A magnitude-5.2 earthquake rattled Greece's capital early Tuesday, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Geodynamic Institute in Athens said the quake occurred at 4:09 a.m. (0109 GMT) Tuesday in the Gulf of Northern Evia, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Athens - in a narrow strip of sea between the island of Evia and mainland Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece's Civil Protection Agency said police in the city of Halkida, near the quake's epicenter, and elsewhere in the surrounding region, reported no damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earthquakes are common in Greece and neighboring Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It was an earthquake that occurred quite near the surface and was felt quite intensely in Athens - from an area where quakes are fairly common but rarely stronger than today's event," said seismologist Efthimios Lekkas, director of the state-run Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There have already been two aftershocks after this earthquake ... I don't think there is any particular cause for concern."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The U.S. Geological Survey also recorded the earthquake as being of magnitude 5.2, and at a depth of 5.8 kilometers (3.6 miles).</td></tr>
