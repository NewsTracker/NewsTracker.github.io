<h3>Say thanks for negative gearing: Morrison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A senior Abbott government minister has put paid to the prospect of any changes to negative gearing, arguing it has given mums and dads on modest incomes an incentive to invest in residential property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"There is an urban myth running around that negative gearing is the province of the rich and should be for the high jump," Social Services Minister Scott Morrison wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Where Australians try to build their wealth and finances for their own retirement we should just say thanks, rather than putting them in our tax sights."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An industry sector analysis of Australian Tax Office statistics show those claiming negative gearing concessions included 83,000 clerical workers, 62,000 teachers and child carers and 12,300 emergency service workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>All of them earned under $80,000 per annum, the Property Council of Australia analysis found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The data clearly showed negative gearing was something middle Australia used to help build their household wealth, chief executive Ken Morrison said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"These people aren't the rich and famous, nor are they property barons, but they do deserve a fair go."</td></tr>
