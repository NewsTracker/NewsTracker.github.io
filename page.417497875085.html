<h3>Google founder defends accident records of self-driving cars</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Google co-founder Sergey Brin sees little reason to release the accident reports involving the Internet company's self-driving cars because he believes there's nothing new in documents that have been withheld so far to protect the privacy of other motorists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Brin, who oversees Google's fleet of self-driving cars, outlined his rationale Wednesday during a sometimes-testy exchange with a long-time critic at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Mountain View, California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As part of his effort to show Google has nothing to hide, Brin disclosed that one of the company's self-driving cars had been rear-ended at a traffic signal during the past week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With that collision, Google's self-driving cars have now been involved in 12 accidents while covering more than 1.7 million miles during the past six years, according to the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The self-driving cars have never been at fault, according to Google, though a company employee was in control at the time of one crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We don't claim that the cars are going to be perfect," Brin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Our goal is to beat human drivers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google is planning to begin testing the latest version of its self-driving car around the streets of Mountain View and other nearby public roads this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>About 25 of the pod-like, two-seat vehicles initially will be cruising around at speeds topping out at 25 miles per hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Consumer Watchdog, a group that has been lambasting Google for years, is demanding that the company release the self-driving cars' accident reports filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles to give the public a better understanding of the risks posed by the vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Associated Press also has requested the records from Google and the DMV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both Google and the DMV have cited privacy concerns for keeping the reports under wraps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Even if the accident records were released with the names of the drivers censored, Brin said the documents wouldn't disclose anything different from a summary that the company posted online three weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Including the most recent accident, Google says its self-driving cars have been rear-ended eight times, side-swiped twice and hit by another vehicle rolling through a stop sign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I suppose we could give more detail and we are open to that, but you are not going to learn anymore," Brin told John Simpson, Consumer Watchdog's privacy project director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The driverless cars are among several ambitious projects that Google has been funding outside its primary business of Internet search and advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The list of far-flung initiatives include a contact lens that monitors glucose levels in diabetics and Internet-beaming balloons hovering over remote areas of the world with little or no online access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Google CEO Larry Page, the company's other co-founder, describes the projects as "moonshots" that he hopes will make the world a better place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He assured Google shareholders Wednesday that "everything is getting better, in general, by quite a bit," thanks to technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I think we should be optimists and be excited by all the things we are building and contributing to the world," Page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>This story has been corrected to clarify that Google says a company employee was in control of a self-driving car in the only accident caused by one of the vehicles.</td></tr>
