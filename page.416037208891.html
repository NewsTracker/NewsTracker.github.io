<h3>Encarnacion HR off Tanaka, Blue Jays beat Yankees in opener (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Without retired Derek Jeter in the lineup, an opening day crowd at Yankee Stadium reserved its biggest cheers for Rodriguez in his first game back from a year-long drug suspension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Batting seventh, his lowest spot in a regular-season game since 1996, A-Rod singled, walked, and lined out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Drew Hutchison, at 24 the youngest opening day starter in Blue Jays' history, held the Yankees hitless until Brian McCann laced a ball just inside the first base line for a single with two outs in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hutchison (1-0) allowed three hits, including Brett Gardner's homer in the sixth inning, to help Toronto improve to 20-19 in openers, including 1-2 vs. the Yankees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Last July, Hutchinson helped the Blue Jays snap another skid against New York: a 17-game losing streak in the Bronx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ex-Yankee Russell Martin hit a two-run single in a five-run third inning against Tanaka (0-1).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Devon Travis homered later in the game for his first career hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Shortly before the Yankees ran onto the field for the first time without a member of the Core Four - Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada - on the roster since 1995, the AC/DC song with the lyric ''Are you ready for the good times'' blared over the stadium speakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Those good times didn't last long for New York in its 113th opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After Tanaka made Toronto look silly with a heavy mix of sliders and splitter for the first two innings, striking out three, the Blue Jays solved him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kevin Pillar led off the third with a single and the Japanese star, making his first opening day start for New York, struggled to get an out after that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Travis walked and Jose Reyes put down a bunt that third baseman Chase Headley threw away, allowing a run to score.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>After Reyes was checked by a trainer at second base, Martin, who signed an $82 million, five-year free-agent contract this winter, singled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An out later, Encarnacion connected for a 5-0 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Yankees are counting on Tanaka to find the form that made him an All-Star in his rookie season last year before partially tearing a ligament in his right elbow and missing 2 1/2 months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But he lasted only four innings Monday, the shortest opening day start by a Yankees pitcher since Phil Niekro in 1985, when he went four innings against the Red Sox, according to STATS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A couple of days after saying he expected the velocity on his fastball down, Tanaka was right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He was regularly in the mid-90s mph last year, and twice hit 93 this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Blue Jays: OF Michael Saunders (left knee meniscus) is running on a treadmill and taking swings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Manager John Gibbons said it would be a couple of more weeks before he joined the Blue Jays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Yankees: Manager Joe Girardi said he will have to be careful to pick A-Rod's days off to keep him fresh and healthy throughout the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Rodriguez was the DH in the opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>After a day off, the Blue Jays turn to knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, in the final year of a three-year contract with Toronto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Yankees send to the mound Michael Pineda, hoping to remain healthy and have his first full season with New York since arriving in a trade with Seattle in January 2012.</td></tr>
