<h3>Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was '100% fit to fly'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>And at some point, investigators said Thursday, he became intent on ending his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Andreas Guenter Lubitz locked himself in the cockpit and said nothing as the pilot tried to break down the door Tuesday, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Flight data recordings indicate that he breathed normally as he steered the plane into the mountainside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lubitz intended to kill himself, Marseille Public Prosecutor Brice Robin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities refused to label it a "suicide" since he was also responsible for the deaths of so many others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lubitz had logged only 100 hours with that type of plane, an Airbus A320, before the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He had flown a total of 630 hours since he was hired by Germanwings in September 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lubitz passed all his medical exams, and showed no signs of bipolar disorder, substance abuse, personality disorder or other conditions, according to The Aviation Business Gazette.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"He was 100 percent fit to fly without any restrictions," Carsten Spohr, CEO of Germanwings' parent company Lufthansa, told reporters Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"His flight performance was perfect. There was nothing to worry about."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Flying was Lubitz's dream, according to LSC Westerwald, the German flying club of which he was a member since he was about 14 or 15 years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The man from Montabaur, about 40 miles from Frankfurt, showed his passion for flying early, earning a gliders license as a teen, records show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lubitz graduated from the demanding German preparatory school Mons-Tabor High School in 2007, a year before he began training with Lufthansa in Bremen, Germany, and Phoenix, Ariz., Spohr said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He took a "several-month gap" in training in 2009, but earned his student pilot license the next year after flying more than 1,000 hours, Spohr said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He spent 11 months as a Lufthansa flight attendant as he waited to become a Germanwings pilot, Spohr said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The same month Lubitz was hired, the Federal Aviation Administration recognized him for joining the "prestigious" ranks of other FAA-certified airmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He continued to live with his parents in Montabaur, Mayor Gabriele Wieland told German newspaper Bild.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Four police cars guarded the two-story house in a wealthy sub-division Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The curtains were drawn, preventing the swell of reporters outside from seeing in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lubitz also had a home in Dusseldorf, the intended destination of the doomed plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Robin would not speculate why Lubitz wanted to die, telling reporters that he's "not in the head of the co-pilot."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Yet Lubitz, a "rather quiet" but friendly guy, showed no signs of depression when acquaintance Peter Ruecker saw him last fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"He was happy he had the job with Germanwings and he was doing well," Ruecker, who watched Lubitz learn to fly, told the Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"He gave off a good feeling."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Lubitz had a girlfriend and "a lot of friends," Ruecker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"He wasn't a loner."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He had plenty of interests besides flying, according to his now-defunct Facebook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He frequented night clubs and listened to pop music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In 2011, he ran the Lufthansa half marathon in Frankfurt in 1 hour and 48 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Those who knew him, either from the flying club or from the neighborhood, said they were "shocked" because Lubitz was a "normal guy," Reuters reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I got to know him, or should I say reacquainted with him, as a very nice, fun and polite young man," flying club chairman Klaus Radke said.</td></tr>
