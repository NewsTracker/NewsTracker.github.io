<h3>France wins big, Italy, Blanchett lose out in Cannes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France French film "Dheepan" won the top Palme d'Or prize for director Jacques Audiard at the 68th Cannes International Film Festival on Sunday, crowning a good night for French cinema but a bad one for Italy and actress Cate Blanchett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The choice of a film that revolves around the lives of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka's civil war moving to France was seen as sending a political message, but the awards overall left some critics and festivalgoers dumbfounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's extremely disappointing, nobody seems happy," Jay Weissberg, European-based critic for trade publication Variety, told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's an anti-climactic finish to a festival that was middling to begin with."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ethan Coen, who along with his brother Joel served as co-president of the jury, defended the jury's choices, especially the Palme d'Or winner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Everybody had an enthusiasm for it, to some degree or another we all thought it was a very beautiful movie," he told a press conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Actor and jury member Jake Gyllenhaal got a laugh when he interjected: "It's a good prize."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hungarian director Laszlo Nemes's debut film "Saul Fia" (Son of Saul), which made a huge impact at the festival for its portrayal by non-professional actor Geza Rohrig of a Jewish "Sonderkommando" forced laborer in the Auschwitz concentration camp, took the Grand Prix second prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos's surreal English-language film "The Lobster" about guests at a posh singles hotel who are turned into animals if they don't find a mate took the Jury Prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Taiwan's Hou Hsiao-Hsien won best director for "Nie Yianniang" (The Assassin) and Mexican director Michel Franco got best screenplay for "Chronic".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But three Italian entries among 19 films competing for the Palme d'Or went home empty-handed, as did Blanchett whose performance as a wealthy woman who falls in love with a shopgirl in the lesbian romance "Carol" won high critical praise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Instead, Rooney Mara, who plays the shopgirl in director Todd Haynes's film shared the best actress award with France's Emmanuelle Bercot, who stared in director Maiwenn's "Mon Roi" (My King).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Among the Italian films, Nanni Moretti's "Mia Madre" (My Mother), about a woman director whose life spins out of control while her mother is dying, had been tipped as a possible winner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>France's Vincent Lindon, who took the best actor prize for his portrayal in Stephane Brize's film "La Loi du Marche" (The Measure of a Man) of a floorwalker in a supermarket that has a secret plan to get rid of employees to boost the bottom line, was unapologetic about France's strong showing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's not because it's in Cannes that we can't receive prizes as other people and this year maybe they wanted to celebrate French cinema," Lindon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Palme d'Or winner tells the story of Tamil refugees trying to make a new life on a violent and drug-infested French housing estate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I'm very moved. Winning a prize from the Coen brothers is something that is exceptional," Audiard, who has won two smaller Cannes awards in the past, told the closing ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I'm thinking of my father."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Scott Roxborough, a critic for the trade publication The Hollywood Reporter, said Audiard had been in the running for a Cannes award for a long time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I don't think it's his best film but it's a hot topic ... It honors the director and sends a political message at the same time," Roxborough said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Director Jacques Audiard, Palme d'Or award winner for his film ''Dheepan'', delivers a speech on stage during the closing ceremony of the 68th Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, southern France, May 24, 2015.</td></tr>
