<h3>MLB: Orioles win in return to Baltimore</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Orioles 5, Blue Jays 2: Manny Machado, Chris Davis and Adam Jones hit homers, and the Orioles won in their return to Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Because of rioting and violence in the city, the Orioles had not played in front of their home fans since April 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yankees 11, Rays 5: CC Sabathia won for the first time in more than a year, and Alex Rodriguez hit one of five New York homers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sabathia (1-5), who missed most of last season with a knee injury, earned his first win since April 24, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rodriguez's eighth homer of the season was the 662nd of his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pirates 4, Phillies 3: Gerrit Cole pitched seven effective innings, and Starling Marte hit a three-run homer to spark Pittsburgh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Brewers 10, White Sox 7: Elian Herrera and Khris Davis homered in the eighth inning to boost Milwaukee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Herrera's two-run shot off Zach Duke broke a 7-all tie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Chicago starter Jeff Samardzija was tagged for eight hits and seven runs -- five earned -- in six innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Cubs 4, Mets 3: Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo homered in the first inning to power Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Cubs opened the bleachers in left and center for the first time this season at Wrigley Field, and Bryant provided a stirring welcome with a two-run shot to left for the prospect's first homer at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Rangers 8, Royals 2: Adrian Beltre hit his 399th career home run, Thomas Field hit his first, and Texas beat a weary Kansas City team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Royals didn't arrive in Texas until 5:45 a.m. Monday after a rain-delayed win in Detroit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Braves 2, Reds 1: Atlanta pinch-hitter Phil Gosselin singled off Aroldis Chapman to open the ninth, stole a base and scored on the Cincinnati closer's wild pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Nationals 11, Diamondbacks 1: Denard Span and Ryan Zimmerman homered in the first inning, and Washington cruised to its fifth straight win.</td></tr>
