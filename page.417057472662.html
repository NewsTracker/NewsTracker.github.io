<h3>Influential cleric Qaradawi condemns Egypt death sentences</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Youssef al-Qaradawi said death sentences passed against himself and Egypt's former president Mohammed Morsi are "against the rules of god".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Senior Muslim cleric Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawi has condemned death sentences passed on himself, former Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi and 105 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood group over a mass jail break in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a video statement posted on Qaradawi's Twitter account on Sunday, the elderly Qatar-based cleric who is also a spiritual leader for the Muslim Brotherhood, said the rulings were "nonsense" and violated Islamic law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"These rulings have no value and cannot be implemented because they are against the rules of God, against the people's law ... No-one will accept it," Qaradawi said in the statement, which was broadcast by Al Jazeera's Arabic news channel in Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In line with all death sentences, the decisions issued on Saturday will be referred to the grand mufti, Egypt's religious authority, for a non-binding opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The charges relate to Morsi's escape along with other Brotherhood leaders from a prison north of Cairo during the 2011 Arab Spring unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Qaradawi denied involvement in the escape in his video statement and said he was in Qatar at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An Egyptian regarded as one of Islam's top thinkers, Qaradawi's religious shows on Al Jazeera have been watched by millions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His criticism of Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, the former army chief elected to succeed Morsi after a popularly backed takeover in 2013, has added to a rift between Qatar and other Gulf Arab states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia considers the Islamist group a terrorist organisation and has heavily funded Mr Sisi's cash-strapped government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Amid the tensions, Qaradawi's televised Friday sermons have gone off the air, but he continues to criticise Egypt's new rulers in conferences and statements to the press and followers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's the right of people to revolt against corruption and unfairness. I still call on people to revolt," Qaradawi said.</td></tr>
