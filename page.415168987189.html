<h3>Homeland funding appears on track minus immigration add-ons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a major victory for President Barack Obama, the Republican-led House overcame last-minute opposition from GOP critics on Tuesday and moved toward final passage of legislation to fund the Homeland Security Department without restrictions on immigration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bill's approval was assured after Republicans demanding the bill include constraints on Obama's immigration policy were turned back on a test vote of 140-278.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Obama's signature was assured on the measure, which cleared the Senate last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Without it, short-term funding for the department would expire on Friday at midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., center, joins other lawmakers as they head to the chamber for a procedural vote on a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that has produced partisan gridlock in the first several weeks of the new Congress, at the Capitol in Washington, Monday, March 2, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio walks to the House chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, Feb. 27, 2015, for a procedural vote as Congress moves toward a spending bill for the Homeland Security Department hours before a shutdown was to begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Bitterly admitting defeat, the Republican-controlled Congress sent legislation to President Barack Obama on Tuesday that funds the Department of Homeland Security without any of the immigration-related concessions they demanded for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Obama promised to sign the bill as soon as he received it, while criticizing Congress for taking "far too long" to pass it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Sanity is prevailing," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Peter King, R-N.Y., a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, before the House voted 257-167 in favor of the $40 billion spending bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>All 182 Democrats present voted for the bill, while it received only 75 Republican "yes" votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I am glad that House Republicans finally came to their senses," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Loretta Sanchez of California, a top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The outcome averted a partial agency shutdown which would have begun Friday at midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It was a major victory for Obama and the Democrats, and a wholesale retreat for Republicans, who have spent months railing against an "unconstitutional overreach" by Obama in extending deportation stays and work permits to millions of immigrants in this country illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In the end, Republicans who'd tried to use the DHS spending bill to undo Obama's actions had little to show but weeks of gridlock and chaotic spectacle on Capitol Hill in the wake of assuming full control of Congress in the November midterm elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The turmoil brought the Homeland Security Department to within hours of a partial shutdown last Friday before Congress passed a one-week extension, and raised questions about Republicans' ability to govern responsibly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Tuesday morning, addressing an uncharacteristically subdued gathering of House Republicans, Speaker John Boehner indicated he was out of options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president," Boehner told his caucus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I believe this decision - considering where we are - is the right one for this team, and the right one for this country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Our Republican colleagues in the Senate never found a way to win this fight," he said, noting that the matter is now in the courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A federal judge last month put Obama's directives on hold, a ruling the White House is appealing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Conservative lawmakers who humiliated Boehner last week by voting down a three-week spending bill he proposed did not speak up in the private meeting to dissent or ask questions, people present said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Afterward, they said they were disappointed but had no more moves to make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I don't know that there is one," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Steve King, R-Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"This is the signal of capitulation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In a statement, Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson thanked Democrats and Republicans who voted for the bill and, "in particular, those in Congress who showed the leadership necessary to get the job done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In his own statement, Obama praised Homeland Security employees as "law enforcement professionals and brave patriots who do a remarkable job, and deserve our gratitude and respect. Today, after far too long, Congress finally voted to fully fund their mission."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The measure passed Tuesday funds the Homeland Security Department through the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>30 end of the budget year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It pays for numerous priorities including Transportation Security agents, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, a host of immigration-related functions and grants to local governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>There have been suggestions that Boehner would face an insurrection by tea party-backed conservatives if he brought a "clean" DHS bill to the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But Boehner's opponents seemed resigned, and there was little sign of a brewing coup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Indeed, several Republicans said Tuesday that the outcome was inevitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Many had campaigned for re-election last fall on promises to stop Obama on immigration, and cheered when Boehner promised to fight the president's moves "tooth and nail."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Yet several acknowledged they never had a viable plan to do so, given Obama's veto pen and Senate Democrats' opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The GOP strategy was especially risky given the Homeland Security Department's anti-terrorism responsibilities, which gave Democrats an opening to accuse Republicans of putting national security at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"We all knew how this was going to end," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Charlie Dent, R-Pa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"If somebody wants to make an argument against those of us who are doing our duty and governing responsibly, they can feel free to have the argument. We are prepared to defend ourselves and I believe the Speaker will come out of this just fine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The drama unfolded as a lesson in the limits of divided government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The fight was set up last fall, when Boehner and GOP leaders persuaded House conservatives to wait until this year to try to overturn Obama on immigration, when the GOP would command control of the Senate and bigger majorities in the House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Congress passed a full-year spending bill for the rest of the government, but kept the Homeland Security Department on a short leash to use its spending bill as the vehicle to oppose Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Republicans predicted that the handful of Senate Democrats who'd voiced concerns about Obama's immigration actions would join them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>But the DHS spending bill the House passed in January was yanked to the right by conservatives, undoing not only Obama's most recent executive actions but an earlier directive, from 2012, that extended protections to immigrants brought illegally to the country as children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>That helped unify Democrats against it, and Senate rules did the rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Republicans command only 54 votes in the chamber, not the 60 needed to advance most legislation, and Senate Democrats blocked the House bill repeatedly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>In the end, the House contingent that opposed Boehner had little to do but bemoan what had become a foregone conclusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>As the drama neared its conclusion Tuesday they offered a few final procedural moves - forcing the reading clerk to read part of the bill out loud, and offering a motion to table - but they had no hope of prevailing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"I believe this is a sad day for America," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., one of the hardliners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>"If we're not going to fight now, when are we going to fight?"</td></tr>

<h3>Nigeria stalls Chad, aims to beat Boko Haram before election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A burnt motorcycle is seen after Chadian forces took control from Boko Haram insurgents in Dikwa March 2, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>N'DJAMENA/YAOUNDE (Reuters) - When battle-hardened Chadian troops overran a Boko Haram camp in northern Nigeria last week, they wanted to press deep into territory controlled by the Islamist group but Nigeria refused to let them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Having defeated al Qaeda in Mali two years ago, Chad's military believes it could finish off Boko Haram alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It has notched up victories that have pushed the Nigerian militants back from the Cameroonian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But with presidential elections this month, Nigeria is keen to press ahead with its own military campaign against Boko Haram, aiming to push it out of major towns before the March 28 ballot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a country proud to be a major African power, it would be an embarrassment to President Goodluck Jonathan as he seeks reelection for a smaller nation to tackle Nigeria's security problems, diplomats say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In their forward base in the town of Gambaru on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, Chadian soldiers displayed dozens of guns seized from Boko Haram and a burnt-out armored vehicle painted with black and white Arabic script.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We turned back because Nigeria did not authorize us to go any further," army spokesman Colonel Azem Bermandoa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nigeria's spokesman for operations in the northeast, Mike Omeri, said cooperation between Chadian and Nigerian forces has brought some major military successes and any issues would be resolved via existing command structures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the Chadians say there have been no joint operations between the two forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chad's offer to join a Nigerian offensive to capture Baga, site of one of Boko Haram's worst atrocities in January, was rebuffed, Bermandoa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Officials from Chad, Niger and Cameroon say lack of cooperation from Nigeria has for months hampered efforts to put together a regional taskforce against Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Chad was compelled to take unilateral action in January, under a deal that allows it to pursue terrorists into Nigeria, after Boko Haram violence started to choke off imports to its economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With Niger and Cameroon deploying thousands of troops on their borders, blocking escape routes for Boko Haram, the tide may be turning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In what Nigeria has branded a sign of desperation, the Islamist group has carried out wave of suicide attacks and threatened to disrupt the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Francois Conradie, analyst with South African-based NKC Research, said that if the current offensive can be sustained, Boko Haram could quickly be driven out of the remaining towns it holds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It would, however, remain a deadly rural guerrilla force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"All of this is good news for stability and will probably be to Mr Jonathan's electoral advantage," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Many in Nigeria ask why it took so long to act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Boko Haram killed thousands last year and kidnapped many more in its six-year campaign for an Islamist emirate in Africa's largest oil producer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Niger, Cameroon and Chad say Nigeria neglected the uprising in its economically backward northeast, an opposition stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Borno state is home to two percent of Nigeria's 170 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But in recent months, Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler who is running as the presidential candidate for the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), has gained popularity with voters desperate for tough policies both on corruption and Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Amid pressure from the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria's electoral commission announced a six week postponement to the Feb. 14 election, to allow the army to tackle the security situation in the northeast so voting could go ahead there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Ernst Hogendoorn, Crisis Group's Africa deputy program director, said the government appeared to have engineered the delay in the hope the APC would slip up or the military could boost Jonathan by defeating Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Boko Haram has certainly suffered a strategic setback ... Clearly this improves Goodluck Jonathan's chances somewhat," said Hogendoorn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"The question is do any of these forces have the ability to maintain this tempo, particularly the Chadians and to a lesser degree the Nigerians?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>With Chad already squeezed by a slump in the price of oil, its main export, the government says it can only sustain the offensive in Nigeria for a short time, diplomats say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Buhari, however, has already criticized Jonathan for relying on Chad to push back Boko Haram, saying his government would tackle the problem alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Many in the military and the government are keen to limit foreign involvement on Nigerian soil, diplomats say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>When Chadian forces last month entered the town of Dikwa, they were told to leave by Nigeria's military, which said it was planning air strikes, Bermondoa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>After Nigeria's army retook Baga last month, Army Chief Major General Kenneth Minimah said his soldiers would recapture a handful of remaining towns before the elections, listing Dikwa as one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"The war is almost ended," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Boko Haram was long regarded by neighboring countries as an internal Nigerian problem, but attacks in Cameroon and Niger last year prompted the regional response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Benin and Cameroon agreed in May to join forces against the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Since then, however, distrust and misunderstandings have stymied preparations for the force, due to take effect by the end of this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Nigeria initially sent low-level representatives to planning meetings, angering its allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Cooperation between Cameroon and Nigeria has been dogged by long-running border tensions, while Niger accused Nigerian troops of cowardice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"Nigeria must get involved and honor its promise of providing between 2,500 and 3,000 to the multinational force," said Cameroon's defense spokesman Colonel Didier Badjeck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Cameroon has stepped up its activities since July, when Boko Haram attacked Kolotafa, the hometown of its deputy prime minister, killing dozens and kidnapping his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The government has boosted its security forces in northern Cameroon from 700 to around 7,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"We have to do whatever it takes to make sure the sect does not occupy any town in Cameroon," said Colonel Joseph Nouma, in charge of Operation Alpha, the mission against Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>However, Nouma said he has orders not to enter Nigeria, and Cameroon has denied Nigerian troops the right to pursue insurgents into Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Along its 400 km (250 miles) border with Nigeria, Cameroon has created 14 new bases, with heavy artillery batteries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>It has also deployed surveillance drones, a senior intelligence officer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Another senior Cameroon military figure said they were attempting to choke off Boko Haram's revenues, including the trade in fuel with Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
