<h3>West Point artist's work redefines city's appearance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The side of Cash & Carry Cleaners is painted with clouds rolling over the scene of a dog leaping to catch clothes flapping on a clothesline; another mural salutes Howlin' Wolf and the South's heritage of blues music; another is an Andy Warhol-style rendering of the West Point clock tower in several different color combinations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mansfield, who owns Deborah Mansfield Decorative Painting in West Point and previously operated a faux finishing business in Houston, Texas, has painted for her entire life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She wanted to study art in college, but her father talked her out of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Instead, she studied landscape architecture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When she and her husband moved to West Point three and a half years ago, Mansfield already had a lot of artistic experience under her belt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I joined the Main Street Design Committee," she said, "because I felt like the town needed a fresh coat of paint."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was Mansfield's idea to paint murals on the sides of West Point's buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Her first idea was the mural on the side of Cash & Carry Cleaners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>First she went to the Main Street Design Committee to ask for permission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The committee told her to go to the building's owner, who liked the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The owner paid for the paint supplies, and Mansfield went to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I thought that whole corner needed some help," Mansfield said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I had seen this picture of a painting of a cloudy day with a clothesline, and I thought something like that would be perfect for the side of a dry cleaner wall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The mural sparked interest for more in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The next mural Mansfield produced was the Howlin' Wolf painting, which she designed with Kathy Dyess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"That was interesting because we used prisoners to help lay the brick," Mansfield said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We used a youth group that comes in the summer that helped us paint the walls and pull the weeds away from the original sight, so we had a lot of volunteer input."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She is now working on a fifth mural.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>For each, Mansfield presents her idea and design to the design committee and then to the building's owner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She develops a written agreement with the owner just in case the owner does not like the finished project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Next, she and her assistant, Lila Miller, get to work, paying for the painting equipment with either grant money or money from the building's owner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The time each project takes adds up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Miller put over 400 volunteer hours into the West Point clock tower painting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She does these city murals at no charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Miller is a West Point native who spent several years in Paris, where she was involved in street art groups that worked on public art projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>When she moved back, her sister introduced her to Mansfield, and the two artists began working together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"It's wonderful to work with Deborah," Miller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"She has so many ideas and so much energy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Miller and Mansfield make a good team, Miller said, because while Mansfield is good at coming up with ideas, Miller can foresee obstacles that Mansfield does not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The clock tower is probably Miller's favorite, but the duo has more ideas which they want to present to the committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>For the most part, the community has been supportive of their projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mansfield remembers one incident in which a little boy rode by on his bike and gave her and Miller bottles of water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"There's nothing better than standing outside on a hot day on the scaffolding and a little kid comes by and gives you a cold bottle of water, says 'Thanks for painting that'," Mansfield said.</td></tr>

<h3>Cyclone-ravaged Vanuatu struggles to determine scale of damage, deaths as aid starts flowing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Teams of aid workers and government officials were planning to send a boat packed with supplies to hard-hit Tanna Island, where aerial assessments showed more than 80 percent of homes or buildings had been partially or completely destroyed by Cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lack of food was a growing worry for those who survived the storm, which packed winds of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour when it struck Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Everyone in Tanna and other islands in the south, they really live subsistence lives, so they grow what they need for a short period. ... And the reality is that much of that would have been washed away by this storm," said Tom Perry, spokesman for CARE Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"That's a grave concern because we desperately need to get food to people soon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Flyover crews who surveyed the outer islands saw a flattened landscape and widespread destruction, with survivors below trying to signal them for help, said Colin Collett van Rooyen, Vanuatu director for aid group Oxfam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Teams of aid workers and government officials carrying medical and sanitation supplies, water, food and shelter equipment finally managed to land on Tanna and neighboring Erromango Island on Tuesday, after being stymied in their efforts for days by poor weather and a breakdown in the nation's communications networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The two islands were directly in the path of the storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An aerial assessment showed extensive damage on Erromango, with communities ranging from 70 percent to 100 percent destroyed on the archipelago's fourth-largest island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On other islands, Collett van Rooyen said plane crews saw people had made big, white "H'' marks on the ground in multiple villages, and people on Tongoa island flashed mirrors to attract attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Radio and telephone communications with the outer islands were just beginning to be restored, but remained patchy four days after Cyclone Pam tore through the islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Meanwhile, fears of a measles outbreak prompted aid workers to launch an emergency vaccination drive for children across Vanuatu, which has low rates of immunization and already suffered one outbreak of the disease earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Teams were traveling to evacuation centers and other storm-ravaged areas around Port Vila to vaccinate children, provide Vitamin A and hand out bed nets to help stave off mosquito-borne malaria, according to UNICEF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that 11 people were confirmed dead, including five on Tanna, lowering their earlier report of 24 casualties after realizing some of the victims had been counted more than once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Officials with the National Disaster Management Office said they had no accurate figures on how many were dead, and aid agencies reported varying numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The confusion reflects the difficulty of handling a disaster that struck whole communities on remote islands with a near-total communications blackout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Vanuatu is a challenging place at the best of times, in the sense of getting around and logistics," Perry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"So a situation like this is pretty testing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Baldwin Lonsdale, Vanuatu's president, returned to his country on Tuesday night from Japan, where had been attending a U.N. disaster conference when the cyclone struck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I trust the people of Vanuatu. I trust my government. I trust the people that they will stand united together as a nation and to rebuild the nation," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Poor weather and communications issues have hampered relief workers efforts to reach the outer islands for days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Most of the islands have no airports and those that do have only small landing strips that are tricky for large supply planes to navigate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>On the main island of Efate, bridges were down outside Port Vila, impeding vehicle traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"There are over 80 islands that make up Vanuatu and on a good, sunny day outside of cyclone season it's difficult to get to many of them," said Collett van Rooyen of Oxfam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The destruction on Tanna was significantly worse than in the nation's capital of Port Vila, where Pam destroyed or damaged 90 percent of the buildings, Perry said.</td></tr>
