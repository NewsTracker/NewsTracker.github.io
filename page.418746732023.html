<h3>NSA leaker Edward Snowden seeks return to US, on his terms</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Whistleblower Edward Snowden remains in hiding two years after the revelations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Moscow: Somewhere in the thousands of towering apartment blocks that ring the Russian capital, whistleblower Edward Snowden remains in hiding two years after outraging US intelligence agencies with revelations of their snooping into the private communications of millions of ordinary citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Snowden's release of classified files he took from his National Security Agency contractor's job blew the lid off programs long said to be aimed at catching terrorists and keeping Americans safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The leaks triggered a global debate on government trampling of personal liberties and led to last month's congressional action to end the mass collection of telephone records, the first major restrictions on spy agency powers in decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The journalists who were the conduits of Mr Snowden's disclosures have been bestowed with their profession's highest honors, as has director Laura Poitras with an Academy Award for her documentary on the fugitive, CitizenFour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Mr Snowden has gained little more from his revolutionising disclosures beyond the sense of accomplishment he is said to feel, according to the few people in and outside Russia with whom he has occasional contact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In rare interviews the reclusive exile has granted, he has said he would like to return to his US homeland but not to detention and interrogation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Snowden, 32, appears to believe he can set the terms for his repatriation and resolution of the felony espionage charges lodged against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At this distant remove from American politics and security concerns, however, the young crusader may be counting on an unlikely shift in public opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Although pollsters find many younger Americans applaud his whistleblowing, the majority express dislike for him, which probably will discourage leading candidates in the looming presidential election from expending political capital on a call for clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a US News & World Report poll in April, 64 per cent of respondents familiar with Mr Snowden said they held a negative view of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Edward loves America and he would definitely like to return home," Anatoly Kucherena, Mr Snowden's Moscow lawyer, said in an interview at his ornate central Moscow office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"But it is our position, and a very simple one, that as long as his case is politiciced and commented on as it is by politicians of all levels, that his return to his motherland is impossible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Kucherena, who has close ties with the Kremlin, said his client won't negotiate with US authorities as long as they refuse to provide "a guarantee that he won't go to jail for 100 years".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Russian lawyer who was dispatched to assist Mr Snowden when he was marooned at Sheremetyevo International Airport two summers ago points out that Mr Snowden didn't defect to Russia, nor did he disclose to Russian intelligence agents the classified material with which he absconded in May 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It is 1000 per cent true that he did this as an act of conscience," Mr Kucherena insisted, noting that Mr Snowden has said he left all the documents he took from the NSA with journalists in Hong Kong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sergei Markov, an ardent nationalist and Kremlin advisor on diplomacy and international affairs, said Mr Snowden was in need of Russia's protection because "he can compromise thousands of intelligence and military officials".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We can't send him back just because America demands it," Mr Markov said, describing the US justice officials seeking the fugitive's return as a "mafia" intent on revenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ronald Goldfarb, a former federal prosecutor, curated After Snowden, an anthology of essays on security versus privacy in the Information Age that examines the fallout from the NSA leaks for the news media, the courts, the intelligence community and the whistleblowers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We didn't begin this book as a defence of Snowden. Everyone has his own views, that he's either too much an angel or too much a devil. But he has raised profoundly important issues," said Mr Goldfarb, who advocates a more moderate prosecution of Mr Snowden in light of the surveillance reforms that have resulted from his disclosures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Goldfarb points to Mr Snowden's claims - and NSA officials' denials - that he attempted to take his concern about surveillance excesses to higher-ups at the agency, who turned a deaf ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It would be wise on both parties' parts for him to plead guilty to the technical crime he's committed. There is no question he took property he shouldn't have taken," said Mr Goldfarb, whose work for the Justice Department goes back to the Kennedy administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Let's give the government the benefit of a doubt. If Snowden has hurt us in ways we don't know yet, we need to take that in mind. If not, the case can be made for a modest as opposed to severe sentence."</td></tr>
