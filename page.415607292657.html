<h3>Israeli Arabs say they feel a greater sense of exclusion following Netanyahu election win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The election, in which Netanyahu eventually secured his fourth term, highlighted the fraught relationship between Israel's Arab citizens and the Jewish state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Arabs voted in larger numbers than before and turned the main party representing them, the Joint List, into the third-largest in parliament, signaling they are more willing to work within the political system to seek equality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But some also said the campaign, which has polarized Israeli society, reflected an increasingly hostile atmosphere toward Arabs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I felt like someone stuck a knife in my heart because I am always pushing for equality between Arabs and Jews," Zuhair Bahloul, a veteran Arab sportscaster known for his pitch-perfect game commentary in Hebrew, said of Netanyahu's election day remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There is a bit of a feeling of despair because the prime minister is not the prime minister of all citizens, and the right is trying to push the Arabs aside," said Baloul, 64, who will enter parliament for the center-left Zionist Union, which failed to unseat Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In what was seen as an attempt to galvanize his hard-line supporters during Tuesday's election, Netanyahu had warned that "Arab voters are going in droves to the polls," with the help of "left-wing" activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A posting on his Facebook page at midday during the balloting said the high turnout by Arab voters was putting right-wing rule "in danger."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Israeli leader has since said in interviews with U.S. media outlets that he had been misunderstood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He told NBC that he hadn't been trying to suppress Arab voting rights, but to "counter a foreign-funded effort to get the votes that are intended to topple my party."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Asked by NPR if he would engage in fence-mending, given how his remarks were received, Netanyahu said: "Well, I certainly will make sure that everybody understands that I'm the prime minister of all of Israel's citizens, and I really believe that. It's something that my actions have shown. It's not a question of fence-mending, it's a question of real belief, and it's there. I don't have to fabricate it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier, White House spokesman Josh Earnest criticized the original comments as a "cynical election day tactic (that) was a pretty transparent effort to marginalize Arab Israeli votes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, told The Associated Press that anti-Arab rhetoric by Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman - who regularly accuses Arab politicians of representing terrorist groups - pose an "existential threat" to Arab citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Odeh said his party, which won 13 seats in the 120-member Knesset, will respond by fighting to improve the lives of 1.7 million Arabs, who account for just over 20 percent of Israel's population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He has said his party will work on shared issues with center-left Jewish opposition parties and seek membership in key parliamentary committees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Odeh and his allies may be in for a long slog in opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Netanyahu has signaled he will set up a government of right-wing and religious parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That's a potentially more stable coalition than his previous one, which was beset by ideological differences between centrists and ultra-nationalists and lasted less than two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Some analysts have described the 2015 election as a "tribal" vote reflecting the deep ethnic and religious divides even among Jews, despite the campaign's focus on economic issues, such as the high cost of living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After initially trailing in opinion polls, Netanyahu's Likud Party did well in traditional strongholds, including working class towns with large numbers of Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Zionist Union made a strong showing in Tel Aviv, seat of Israel's economic and cultural elites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Odeh said 90 percent of Arab voters backed his party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Working-class Ramla near Tel Aviv is one of just several mixed towns in the country, and Arabs make up 23 percent of its population of 77,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It showed similar patterns, with Likud winning nearly 40 percent of the vote, while the Joint List won 15 percent, according to media reports citing official results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Fayez Mansour, an Arab member of the city council, said Ramla is also typical when it comes to Jewish-Arab relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>On a personal level, they are mostly good, even cordial, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Even in mixed towns, many Arabs and Jews still live in separate neighborhoods and study in separate schools, but the lines are increasingly blurred.</td></tr>
