<h3>Kenya's religions unite in national mourning for massacre victims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Flags flew at half mast after President Uhuru Kenyatta warned that people's "justified anger" should not lead to "the victimisation of anyone, (as) this would only play into the hands of the terrorists".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab militants lined up non-Muslim students during the massacre Thursday described by Kenyatta as a "barbaric medieval slaughter".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The president vowed Saturday to retaliate in the "severest way" for the killings in the northeastern town of Garissa, close to the border with Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The massacre, Kenya's deadliest attack since the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi, claimed the lives of 142 students, three police officers and three soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The terrible events in Garissa are still fresh in our minds and heart, but today is a day for new hope," Kenyan Anglican Archbishop Eliud Wabukala told a packed cathedral in Nairobi, as armed soldiers patrolled outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"These terrorists want to cause scare and divisions in our society, but we shall tell them, you will never prevail."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Top Muslim leader Hassan Ole Naado also offered his condolences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Kenya is at war, and we must all stand together," Naado said, deputy head of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims, saying the organisation was helping to raise money for the funerals of those killed and medical costs of the scores wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We deeply feel the pain of the loss of young lives," he added in a statement, warning the Shebab was aiming to "create religious conflict".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Political and religious leaders have condemned the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Pope Francis called the killings "senseless brutality", while the Cairo-based top Sunni Muslim body Al-Azhar has condemned the "terrorist act committed by Somalia's Shebab."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Saturday, the Shebab warned of a "long, gruesome war" unless Kenya withdrew its troops from Somalia, and threatened "another bloodbath".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hours after the Shebab's warning, police in Garissa paraded four corpses of the gunmen piled on top of each other face down in the back of a pick-up truck followed by a huge crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>All four gunmen were killed, but five men have been arrested in connection with the attack, including three "coordinators" captured as they fled towards Somalia, and two others in the university.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The two arrested on campus included a security guard and a Tanzanian found "hiding in the ceiling" and holding grenades, the interior ministry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Forensic investigators aided by foreign experts continued to scour the site where one student shocked security forces on Saturday -- who had said all students were accounted for -- by emerging unharmed from a wardrobe where she had hidden for over two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The remaining 600 student survivors from the now closed college have now left Garissa for good, boarding buses for the home towns around the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dozens of families of those killed continue to wait for the remains of their loved ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Hurling grenades and firing automatic rifles, the gunmen stormed the university at dawn on Thursday as students were sleeping, shooting dead dozens before setting Muslims free and holding Christians and others hostage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Just before darkness fell, Kenyan troops moved in on the dormitory where the gunmen were holed up, apparently determined to prevent a drawn-out siege like that seen in the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in September 2013, also carried out by Shebab fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The militants vowed more attacks against Kenya, which invaded southern Somalia in 2011 and is now fighting alongside the African Union force battling the Shebab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A $215,000 (200,000 euro) bounty has also been offered for alleged Shebab commander Mohamed Mohamud, a former Kenyan teacher said to be the mastermind behind the Garissa attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Kenyatta also said it was clear terrorist masterminds were operating inside Kenya and not just Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities," he said, warning that "radicalisation is happening openly" in Islamic schools by "rogue" preachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>There has been growing criticism in the media that critical intelligence warnings were missed, and that special forces units took seven hours to reach the university, some 365 kilometres (225 miles) from the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed defended the response, telling AFP that "fighting terrorism... is like being a goalkeeper. You have 100 saves, and nobody remembers them. They remember that one that went past you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Kenya: Garissa University massacre I.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Vericourt / G.</td></tr>
