<h3>Aussie rugby star chases NFL dream with 49ers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(CNN)Australian rugby star Jarryd Hayne is swapping the rugby pitch for the gridiron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Several months after announcing his retirement from Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) and the Parramatta Eels, the 2014 Player of the Year has signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Despite never having played professional American football, the 27-year-old had also attracted interest from a number of other teams, including Super Bowl runners-up Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ultimately, however, he chose San Francisco as his destination, not least because new coach Jim Tomsula has experience working with overseas players, having previously helmed the Rhine Fire in the NFL Europe league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He was probably the one coach that knew the transition better than anyone," Hayne said in a press conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 6' 2", 226 lb New South Wales native ran a 4.53 second 40-yard dash in a December workout. NFL analyst Daniel Jeremy tweeted his support, saying that he believed Hayne has "an excellent chance" of becoming an excellent punt/kickoff returner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Despite this, the Australian said he was aware of the chances he was taking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is a huge risk," NFL.com reported Hayne as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'm taking a massive leap of faith."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As is his new team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Along with a reported guaranteed $100,000 payday, the 49ers -- Super Bowl runners-up in 2013 -- are taking a punt on an untested prospect, albeit one who will not disrupt their roster, or salary cap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 2014, Hayne won the NRL's Dally M awards for Player of the Year, Best Fullback, Top Tryscorer and Representative Player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He has previously won Dally M recognition, most notably in 2009 as Player of the Year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In nine years with the Eels, he scored 103 tries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He made the decision to switch sports in October last year, saying at the time: "I'm always telling people to chase their dreams and follow their hearts -- if I don't live by that I'm not being honest with myself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Despite his lack of hands-on football experience, his new team are confident that his background means that he will be a quick learner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Hayne comes from an athletic family as his father, Manoa Thompson, is a former professional rugby league player who represented Fiji on the national rugby team," the 49ers said in a statement.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine mine blast 'traps dozens'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They only confirmed 23 deaths at the Zasyadko coal mine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ukraine's officials say as many as 33 people may have died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There are fears the rebels lack the resources to deal with the disaster, the BBC's Tom Burridge reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Zasyadko was the scene of Ukraine's worst mine disaster nearly eight years ago, when 101 people were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has demanded access to the mine for government rescuers and police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The mine is close to a front line where the pro-Russian rebels have been battling Ukrainian government troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, Ukraine's mine unions head Mykhailo Volynets told a Ukrainian TV channel there had been no fighting in the area in recent days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While Ukraine's economy has significantly shrunk since fighting began in April, many coal mines continue to operate in the conflict zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mining safety standards are poor, and there are frequent accidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Confusion surrounded the death toll in the hours after the blast, which occurred more than 1,000m (3,200ft) underground at 05:20 local time (03:20 GMT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev, speaker Volodymyr Hroisman announced that 32 people had been killed and called for a minute's silence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However, he later retracted the figure, saying instead that one person was dead and the fate of about 30 others was unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The rebels said 23 miners were confirmed dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the Ukraine-controlled Donetsk regional administration said later on Wednesday that 33 people died, and nine bodies had already been recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It is known that, at the time of the blast, 230 people were in the shaft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>About 200 have now been accounted for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The sister of one miner who was in the pit at the time of the explosion, Alexei Novoselsky, stood at the entrance to the mine, in tears, Reuters reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Tell me, are there survivors?" she asked a passing rescue worker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Why are you concealing the truth?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A welder at the mine, who gave his name as Oleg, said: "I've been down the pit for 23 years, and this is the fourth explosion that I can recall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"If they didn't get them out straight away, then later they will only retrieve bodies. An explosion is a terrible thing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The mine is one of Ukraine's biggest coal producers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At the end of last year, the mine was reportedly still supplying coal to coke and chemical works owned by Ukraine's wealthiest businessman, Rinat Akhmetov, in Donetsk region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In the old coal-mining area of Donbas, the Zasyadko mine is one of the newest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It started operations in 1958 and is now said to be part-owned by Yukhym Zvyahilsky, a local leader with money and influence who was once an acting prime minister of Ukraine and is now an MP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The mine is also one of the most dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It is deep and it has particularly hazardous levels of methane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The year 2007 was particularly bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It saw three accidents, the worst of which claimed the lives of 101 miners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In normal circumstances Ukraine has an established rescue procedure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>There are many skilled local rescuers helped by teams that are brought in quickly from other parts of Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But these are not normal times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The war in eastern Ukraine caused a lot of material damage to infrastructure, power supply and road links across the Donbas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>It also ruptured the existing links with central authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It is unlikely that the rebels will talk to Kiev and allow the rescue teams in but will they turn to Russia for help?</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Whatever the death toll of this accident, it adds to the depressing statistics in this part of Ukraine where the UN has reported more than 6,000 people killed by the conflict that is tearing it apart.</td></tr>
