<h3>Vanuatu president speaks of devastation from Cyclone Pam</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Pacific island nation of Vanuatu has lost years of development progress and must "start over" following a powerful cyclone that destroyed or damaged 90 percent of the buildings on the main island of Port Vila, the country's president said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale, left, Minister for Climate Change James Bule, center, and National Disaster Management Office Director Shadrack Rubart Welegtabit discuss before an interview in their hotel room in Sendai, Miyagi prefecture, northeastern Japan, Monday, March 16, 2015 while attending a U.N. conference on disaster risk reduction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>SENDAI, Japan (AP) - Baldwin Lonsdale, president of Vanuatu, the Pacific island nation devastated by a powerful tropical storm last week, was attending a disaster conference in the Japanese city of Sendai when the cyclone struck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>So far, he and his delegation have received information only from Vanuatu's main city of Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Following are excerpts from an interview with The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Q: What is the situation in Vanuatu now?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A: "Cyclone Pam has devastated Port Vila. More than 90 percent of the buildings and houses in Port Vila have been destroyed or damaged. The state of emergency that has been issued is only for Port Vila. Once we receive an update on the extent of the damage in the provinces then another state of emergency will be issued for the outer islands."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Q: Is there an update on casualties and damage?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A: "More than 1,000 people have been evacuated to evacuation centers and will be returning to their homes sometime later today, if their homes still stand. That's in Port Vila alone. Confirmed dead in Port Vila is six and more than 30 injuries. I do believe the number of casualties will not be high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Q: Is there anything more that could have been done to prepare for the storm?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A: "This is a very devastating cyclone in Vanuatu. I term it as a monster, a monster. It's a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. After all the development that has taken place, all this development has been wiped out. So it means we will have to start anew again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Q: What are the urgent needs for Vanuatu?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A: "The first priority is the humanitarian needs. People have lost many of their properties. Clothing, eating utensils, bathing . most of the necessary items of the households, all this has been destroyed and damaged. I really request for humanitarian needs and assistance at this stage. Tarpaulins, water containers, medical needs, gathering tools, construction tools all these are very important right now."</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>Do you see the impact of climate change yourself?</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>Q: How are you feeling as you prepare to head back home?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A: "Very emotional. My heart is for the people. Everyone has that same feeling. We don't know what has happened to our families. Because there is a breakdown in communications we cannot reach our families. We do not know if our families are safe or not. As the leader of the nation, my whole heart is for the people, the nation."</td></tr>

<h3>Wealthy eccentric says in HBO finale he 'killed them all'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Durst was arrested on a murder warrant just before Sunday evening's finale of an HBO serial documentary about his links to three sensational killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the finale, Durst was asked about similarities in handwriting in a letter he wrote and another linked to one of the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Later, filmmakers said Durst wore his microphone into the bathroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What followed was a bizarre rambling in which Durst said, apparently to himself, "There it is. You're caught" and "What the hell did I do? Killed them all of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The show ended, and it wasn't clear whether producers confronted Durst about the secretly recorded words, or what Durst meant by them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Durst was arrested by FBI agents Saturday at a New Orleans hotel, on a warrant from Los Angeles for the murder of a mobster's daughter 15 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Durst was ordered held without bond pending another hearing Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His lawyer, Chip Lewis, said Durst will agree to be taken to Los Angeles to face the first-degree murder charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Durst participated in the documentary, giving an extensive interview to filmmaker Andrew Jarecki for "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Lewis said nothing his client revealed changes his innocence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's all about Hollywood now," Lewis told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A call to Lewis seeking comment about Sunday's final episode hasn't been returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Durst's estranged and fearful relatives thanked authorities for tracking him down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done," said his brother, Douglas Durst, in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Durst, 71, has always maintained his innocence in the 2000 murder of Susan Berman, whose father was an associate of Las Vegas mobsters Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Berman, 55, a writer who became Durst's spokeswoman, was killed at her home near Beverly Hills with a bullet to the back of her head as New York investigators prepared to question her in the unsolved 1982 disappearance of Durst's wife, Kathleen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The jig is up," said former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, who had hoped Berman would help solve the disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The documentary uncovered "evidence that law enforcement in three states wasn't able to unearth," added Pirro, who now hosts Justice with Judge Jeanine on Fox News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The climax of last week's episode revealed a hand-written address on a letter, recovered by the slain woman's relative, that Durst had sent to Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The handwriting seems virtually identical to an anonymous letter alerting Beverly Hills police to a "cadaver" in Berman's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Even the word "Beverly" is misspelled as "Beverley" on both documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Durst observes in the documentary that only Berman's killer could have sent the letter to police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Jarecki is then shown putting the other letter in a safe deposit box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The episode didn't indicate whether Jarecki shared that earlier letter with the authorities, but the Los Angeles Police said the arrest resulted from "investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the last year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Lewis said he didn't know if police had previously examined the newly revealed letter, but said Durst had provided handwriting samples to LAPD in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I know all about this case," Lewis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I have no doubt we will present a most compelling defense."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He's got no doubt the timing of the arrest was orchestrated in coordination with HBO's broadcast of the final episode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Neither LAPD nor the movie's producers would comment on that claim.</td></tr>
