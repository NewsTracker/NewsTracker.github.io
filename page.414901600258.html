<h3>Don't File Taxes Early, Wrong Tax Statements Sent, Admits Obama Administration</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>I enjoy untangling a tax mess from the past, disputing taxes with the government or planning taxes for the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One of my specialties is advising about lawsuit payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Whether you're receiving or paying a legal settlement, you can probably improve your tax position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I write frequently about taxes, from expatriation to sales tax, from selling your company to restitution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>I've written over 30 tax books, but my best seller is still Taxation of Damage Awards and Settlement Payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Contact me at wood@WoodLLP.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If you thought the fears of identity theft made you want to file taxes early this year, think again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I previously said there are 7 Reasons Not To File Your Taxes Early, Even If You'll Get A Refund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But there's at least one more, and it is a big and embarrassing one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Obama administration has announced that roughly 800,000 bad tax statements were sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Yes, that is the new health care tax form, IRS Form 1095-A.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>You need it to calculate how much tax you owe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>HealthCare.gov sent these forms out to millions of consumers receiving coverage through the federal insurance market that serves most states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Maybe it is a success that many of those forms were OK?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That's one way to spin it, but if 800,000 are wrong, that's a slight problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Think of these Forms 1095-A like a Form W-2 for health care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They provide a month-by-month accounting of the subsidies consumers received to help pay their health care premiums.This is the latest in long string of snafus in the Affordable Care Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>More and more, the massive and expensive law is looking burdensome to millions of Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Independently, this has already been a bad tax season opener, with new and widespread fears about tax fraud and identity theft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The FBI is investigating fraudulent tax returns filed through TurboTax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In past years, it seemed stressful to collect your Forms W-2 and 1099, and discover you are missing a Form 1099 or K-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>This year makes the usual stresses seem like the good old days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>President Obama's Buzzfeed video asked for more healthcare insurance signups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>To help that effort, there have been repeated delays and extensions to collect more people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Many democrats in Congress are pushing for more extensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Although the culprit this time is incorrect Forms 1095-A Health Insurance Marketplace Statement, there are related tax forms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Consumers also need a Form 8962 Premium Tax Credit, and Form 8965 Health Coverage Exemptions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Forms 1095-A and 8962 are for people who bought health coverage through the Marketplace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Form 8965 is for those who got a Marketplace coverage exemption or plan to claim an exemption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Do not file your tax return with the wrong information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Some people already did, of course, and you just have to wait if that's your situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But if you are affected and haven't yet filed, the government has announced that you will get a corrected Form 1095-A and will be notified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That's right, this needs to be sorted out and that will take time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>You can try calling 1-800-318-2596 or go online, but it is likely to be very frustrating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>There is a similar (though seemingly independent) problem in California, impacting 100,000 or so Californians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Meanwhile amid discussions of extensions of time and grace periods for people to sign up seem a little embarrassing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The IRS has its own problems and a very big job to do apart from administering the hydra that Obamacare has become.</td></tr>
