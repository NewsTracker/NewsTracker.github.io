<h3>Greek anger over state cash grab from hospitals, schools</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greek local authorities were on the brink of revolt Tuesday against the central government's move to use cash reserves from state agencies - including hospitals and kindergartens - to help the country make ends meet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At an emergency meeting in Athens, angry mayors called for blank refusal to comply, staging protests or taking the radical left-led government to court over its order to have spare reserves put in a central bank account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Not a single municipality should deposit even one euro at the Bank of Greece," said Ioannis Lolos, mayor of the northwestern town of Igoumenitsa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Citing an "extremely urgent and unforeseen" need for cash, an emergency government decree Monday rendered funds from state entities - such as the national opera, the national art gallery and even hospitals and kindergartens - available for short-term loans to the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That is expected to raise up to 2.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The move, unprecedented in recent Greek history, is the latest sign that the country is running perilously short of cash amid an impasse in bailout talks with its international creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Until it reaches an agreement with its creditors from the 19-country eurozone and the International Monetary Fund, Greece will not get a badly-needed 7.2 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in rescue funds, without which Athens will be unable to meet loan obligations this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Creditors are demanding reforms that include sweeping changes to pensions and labor rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The three-month-old government has ruled out many key demands, arguing that it was elected to end the kind of stifling budget austerity that worsened a deep recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Greece has depended on rescue loans since it lost market access in 2010 and nearly went bankrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In exchange, successive governments adopted deeply resented spending cuts and tax hikes, as unemployment climbed to record high levels - it has since dipped to 26 percent late last year - and incomes dropped by about a third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The current impasse has revived fears that Greece will soon find itself unable to pay salaries and pensions or service its debt - it has to repay about 1 billion euros to the IMF in May - and have to leave the euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Many had expected that the latest crunch point could come Friday, when Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis is due to meet his eurozone counterparts in the Latvian capital of Riga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But it looks increasingly unlikely that a deal can be struck by then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Greek shares fell for a second straight day Tuesday, with the Athens Stock Exchange general index closing 3.3 percent lower.</td></tr>
