<h3>If you remember this story, another memory will die off</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Patterns of brain activity in the participants were monitored by MRI scans while they were asked to recall individual memories based on images they had been shown earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The researchers, co-led by Dr Michael Anderson, were able to track the brain activity induced by individual memories and show how this suppressed others by dividing the brain into tiny three-dimensional voxels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Based on the fine-grained activation patterns of these voxels, the researchers were able to witness the neural fate of individual memories as they were reactivated initially, and subsequently suppressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Over the course of four selective retrievals the participants in the study were cued to retrieve a target memory, which became more vivid with each trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Competing memories were less well reactivated as each trial was carried out, and in fact were pushed below baseline expectations for memory, supporting the idea that an active suppression of memory was taking place.</td></tr>

<h3>Cyclone Pam lifts chance of El Nino this year in Australia, forecasters says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cyclone Pam's impact may not be restricted to devastating the island nation of Vanuatu - it may also have boosted the likelihood of an El Nino event for later this year, the Bureau of Meteorology said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The strength of category-5 Cyclone Pam combined with tropical storm Bavi to produce "one of the strongest reversals in the trade winds in recent years", the bureau said in its fortnightly wrap-up of the so-called El Nino Southern Oscillation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Global models point to an El Nino later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The chances of an El Nino have "had a real kick along" from Cyclone Pam, said Andrew Watkins, manager of climate prediction services at the bureau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During El Nino years, the trade winds that normally blow east to west weaken or reverse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As a result, the central and eastern equatorial Pacific tends to warm relative to the west, altering weather patterns in ways that reduce rainfall across much of Australia and south-east Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Anomalies for speeds of the trade winds jumped from 3 metres per second to as much as 12 metres per second over the past week, Andrew Watkins, manager of climate prediction services at the bureau said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>El Ninos can have a big impact on Australia's weather, typically resulting in drier, hotter conditions across the eastern states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While conditions have hovered near El Nino thresholds for much of the past year - and the US already declaring such an event earlier this month - this past week's storms have been large enough to shift the odds further in favour an El Nino by mid-2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While climate models typically have less skill at this time of year, most are now pointing to an El Nino event as likely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The models are certainly suggesting that things will continue to warm over the next few months, and reach El Nino thresholds by about June," Dr Watkins said, stressing that predictions do not amount to a guarantee of such an event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>El Nino years also mean the Pacific tends to absorb less heat, lifting global temperatures by 0.1-0.2 degrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With 2014 already declared the hottest year on record, another year of near-El Nino or stronger conditions could see 2015 turn out to be even warmer, climate scientists say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The first two months of this year have continued the trend of 2014, with the 12 months to February the hottest such period in about 130 years of records, according to US data.</td></tr>
