<h3>Gov. Wolf renews case for his agenda in Facebook session</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of written questions expressing viewpoints about tax reform and other issues were posted on Facebook before the event, but they were distilled into about a dozen questions that Wolf answered while sitting at a table with deputy press secretary Megan Healey, a former local TV journalist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In contrast, last month's Twitter Town Hall was faster-paced and allowed residents and interest groups to interact with him directly while tweeted questions scrolled on the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wolf's spokesman, Jeff Sheridan, said the two formats require different approaches but are equally useful in getting out his boss's message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We'll continue to do both," Sheridan said after the roughly 20-minute program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Among other things, the governor defended his proposal to increase the state sales tax from 6 percent to 6.6 percent and extend it to many transactions that are now exempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The plan would generate more than $3 billion a year to finance much of his plan to slash school property taxes and provide additional aid to prekindergarten programs and public schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He also has proposed a new tax on natural gas drilling and a reduction in the corporate net income tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a statement, the state Republican Party noted that Wolf is holding social media events while boosting a proposal that would make computer purchases more expensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If the tax were increased, "many Pennsylvanians won't be able to afford to participate in one of his social media town halls next year," said GOP spokeswoman Megan Sweeney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wolf said he hopes to build bipartisan support for a budget agreement in the GOP-controlled Legislature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The current state budget expires June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Legislators, Republican and Democrat, heard the same thing I did from the voters of Pennsylvania. They want property tax relief. My budget has that in a big way," he said.</td></tr>
