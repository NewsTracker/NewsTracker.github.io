<h3>Aspirin lowers colon cancer risk, but not for all</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) are based on an analysis of 10 large studies in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>More than 16,000 people -- all of European descent -- were included.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The data confirmed that regular use of aspirin or non-steroid anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) was linked to a 30 percent lower colorectal cancer risk, for most people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the preventive benefit was not seen in people with relatively uncommon variants in genes on chromosomes 12 and 15, the study said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Since aspirin and other anti-inflammatories carry risks, such as internal bleeding, doctors must consult with patients about the potential dangers and benefits, said co-senior author Andrew Chan of the Massachusetts General Hospital Gastroenterology Division and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This study suggests that adding information about one's genetic profile might help in making that decision," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"However, it is premature to recommend genetic screening to guide clinical care, since our findings need to be validated in other populations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>African Americans face far higher rates of colon cancer and death from colon cancer than whites, and they were not included in the study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Researchers also hope that more study will help them find out if a person's genes play any role in the likelihood of dangerous side effects from aspirin and NSAIDs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Advances in precision medicine, which aims to tailor treatments to an individual's genetics, mean that studies such as this one may soon have a tangible impact, experts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"In the not-too-distant future it will be possible to affordably and efficiently conduct genetic testing in healthy individuals to more accurately define benefits and risks of interventions intended to decrease risk of disease," said an accompanying editorial in JAMA by Richard Wender of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The ability to translate genetic profiling into tailored preventive care plans for individuals is still years away, but with the study by (Hongmei) Nan et al, the road, arduous as it may be, is more clearly illuminated."</td></tr>

<h3>Islamic State group reports Tunisian leader killed in Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Islamic State group posted a eulogy on a militant website for Ahmed al-Rouissi after he was killed in clashes around the Libyan city of Sirte - a stronghold for the Islamic State affiliate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tunisian Interior Ministry Spokesman Mohammed Ali Aroui told the state news agency that al-Rouissi's death had been confirmed through "scientific means" and in coordination with Libyan authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There has been fighting around Sirte between IS militants and the Misrata-based 166th Battalion, which is loyal to the Libyan government in Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Libya's internationally recognized parliament has been forced from the capital and meets in the eastern city of Tobruk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It is currently in talks with its Tripoli-based rival about forming a national unity government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Al-Rouissi, 48, was considered the mastermind of a string of attacks carried out in Tunisia by the radical Ansar al-Shariah movement, including the 2013 assassinations of left-wing politicians Chokri Belaid and Mohammed Brahmi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Their deaths plunged Tunisia into a political crisis that eventually led to the resignation of the elected Islamist government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ansar al-Shariah founder Seifallah Ben Hassine, has been implicated in the September 2012 assault on the U.S. embassy in Tunis which resulted in severe property damage and the death of four protesters when security forces intervened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ben Hassine and Al-Rouissi fled to Libya where they began fighting under the banner of the Islamic State group, which already controls about a third of Syria and Iraq in a self-declared caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There are an estimated 3,000 Tunisians that have left the country to fight with extremist groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Citing Tunisian Interior Ministry officials briefing the parliament on Tuesday, the state news agency said some 60 Tunisians had been killed so far in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The greatest danger comes from Libya which is not just a transit country but one where terrorist groups have taken root and built training camps in many cities," said the report.</td></tr>
