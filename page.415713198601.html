<h3>Google hires Wall Street's Ruth Porat as new CFO</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOUNTAIN VIEW -- One of Wall Street's most powerful women will become one of Silicon Valley's most powerful women when Ruth Porat joins Google this spring as its chief financial officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Internet search giant on Tuesday announced the hiring of the 57-year-old Porat, a longtime Morgan Stanley banker who became its chief financial officer in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She will become Google's highest-ranking female executive when she starts her new job on May 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Porat described the post as a kind of Silicon Valley homecoming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She grew up in Palo Alto, studied economics at Stanford University and was later a top banker dealing with technology firms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I'm delighted to be returning to my California roots and joining Google," she said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This 2012 photo provided by Morgan Stanley shows outgoing Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Morgan Stanley on Tuesday, March 24, 2015 announced that Porat is leaving the New York investment bank for the same job at Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Porat has been the public face of Morgan Stanley and been referred to in reports as the most senior woman -- or most powerful -- on Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Key positions she has held at the firm include vice chairman of investment banking and co-head of technology investment banking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She was the lead banker on financing rounds for tech companies including Amazon, eBay, Netscape and Priceline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We're tremendously fortunate to have found such a creative, experienced and operationally strong executive," said Google CEO Larry Page in a written statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I look forward to learning from Ruth as we continue to innovate in our core -- from search and ads, to Android, Chrome and YouTube -- as well as invest in a thoughtful, disciplined way in our next generation of big bets."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Porat will be the only woman among Google's five top executives, though the company also has three women in senior leadership roles: Susan Wojcicki, who heads YouTube; Lorraine Twohill, the marketing chief; and Rachel Whetstone, senior vice president of communications and policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Other women who were part of Google's senior leadership team have gone on to high-profile executive positions elsewhere, such as Marissa Mayer, now Yahoo's CEO; and Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Google announced just two weeks ago in a regulatory filing that its current CFO, Patrick Pichette would be retiring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Pichette, who joined Google in 2008, wrote a widely shared post on Google+ explaining his decision to step down to spend more time with his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Google shareholders are likely to welcome Porat's experience in "dealing with complex global operating environments and regulatory challenges," said Peter Stabler, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, in a written note Tuesday, but whether she signals any big changes in Google's philosophy remains unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Pichette had arrived seven years ago during a recession and became known for trimming costs, from unsuccessful business ventures to the hours at the campus cafeterias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In more recent boom years, however, he's been a staunch defender of the company's cutting-edge risks on a wide assortment of research that reflect Google's experimental approach but can make investors nervous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Other tech companies have lured executives from Wall Street, including Twitter, which appointed Anthony Noto as its CFO last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Noto hails from Goldman Sachs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Porat declined interviews Tuesday but her rise through the Wall Street ranks was profiled in a 2010 book, "How Remarkable Women Lead: The Breakthrough Model for Work and Life," written by authors Joanna Barsh, Susie Cranston and Geoffrey Lewis, who work for management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The book described her working parents as an inspiration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Her father, Dan Porat, 93, was an electronic engineer at Stanford's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory from 1962 to 1988.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Her mother, Frieda Porat, was a psychologist and teacher who wrote books about organizational management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She died in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Ruth Porat describes herself on her Twitter profile as a breast cancer survivor and proud Stanford alumnus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She is also vice chairwoman of the Board of Trustees at Stanford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>She has advanced degrees from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the London School of Economics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>After studying economics at Stanford, she took a job at the U.S. Department of Justice in the early 1980s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But she was also fascinated with mergers and acquisitions, which drew her to Morgan Stanley in 1987, according to the book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Revealing her challenges, and successes, as a woman on Wall Street, Porat told the authors that "biases are deep" and it's important to find the right boss.</td></tr>
