<h3>Mexico arrests alleged Sinaloa cartel cocaine trafficker</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Monte Alejandro Rubido, Mexico's national security commissioner, said Cesar Gastelum Serrano was arrested Saturday in the resort city of Cancun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gastelum Serrano was carrying a pistol and 700 grams (24.7 ounces) of cocaine at the time of his arrest, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Rubido said that when Gastelum Serrano was in Cancun, "he moved around the area with a low profile, without bodyguards. He did not carry any identification, not even false ones, to avoid detection."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The U.S. Treasury Department placed Gastelum Serrano on its drug kingpin list in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It called him "one of the most prolific cocaine suppliers for Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said he headed "a vast criminal network to lead a cocaine trafficking organization capable of moving tons of cocaine per week through Honduras and Guatemala to Mexico."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rubido said Gastelum Serrano operated a family company specializing in scaffolding, which allowed him to move "multiple tons" of cocaine per week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rubido said he worked with Sinaloa cartel leader Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada - one of the last of the old-style drug capos still at large in Mexico - and with Damaso Lopez, who has been mentioned as a possible successor to arrested Sinaloa drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rubido said Gastelum Serrano had operated in Honduras, and had been linked to the killing of law enforcement officials there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said he operated for a time in San Pedro Sula, Honduras' most violent city, and moved Colombian cocaine through Central America to the U.S. market, as well as distributing drugs in Central America.</td></tr>
