<h3>ISIS executes four Iraqis from Tikrit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Government forces have battled their way north for months, notching up key victories against IS, but Tikrit has been their toughest target yet with the jihadists having resisted them several times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Commanders voiced hope the operation would be a step towards the recapture of Mosul, the jihadists' main hub in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The operation began early Monday morning after being announced by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi the previous evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Military sources said warplanes were involved, but the Pentagon said they excluded those of the US-led coalition fighting IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We're not providing air strikes in support of the operation around Tikrit," said Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was unclear whether Iranian planes were involved, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Both Iraqi and Iranian media said Qassem Soleimani - the commander of the Al-Quds Force covert operations unit of Tehran's elite Revolutionary Guards - was in Salaheddin province to help co-ordinate operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Abadi urged the security forces to spare civilians, a message echoed by the UN and responding to fears of reprisals against Sunnis in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tikrit is the hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein, the remnants of whose Baath party have collaborated with IS in attempting to topple the Shi'ite-dominated government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>IS declared a caliphate in June straddling Iraq and Syria, where the US-led coalition has also been conducting air strikes but not coordinating with any significant ground force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A senior US senator said American forces were specifically targeting Mohammed Emwazi, the London man dubbed "Jihadi John" believed responsible for videotaped executions of US and other Western hostages in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Oh, yes. He's a target. There should be no question about that," former Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Islamic State jihadist group has released a video in which four Sunni tribesmen from the Tikrit region are executed for allegedly collaborating with the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The video describes those executed as belonging to a tribal group named after a town just north of Tikrit.</td></tr>

<h3>Ming-Na Wen: 'S.H.I.E.L.D.' role makes me a cool mom</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"They love the show," says Wen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Wen says her son and her 14-year-old daughter, Michaela, are especially amazed because her kick-butt TV persona is so very different from the mom they know - a "girlie girl" who loves wearing sundresses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I laugh all the time and I'm always smiling and mommy's the one that does the cooking and mommy's a klutz," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Wen says she's also excited about the remainder of the show's second season, which returns from its winter hiatus Tuesday at 9 p.m. on ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She says the series picks up right where it left off - focusing on S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Skye Johnson, who fans have learned is an Inhuman, Marvel's name for a fictional race of superhumans that appears in various Marvel comic books.</td></tr>
