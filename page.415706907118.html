<h3>Family of alleged Facebook fraud fugitive to forfeit bail: U.S. judge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The family of a New York man who became a fugitive after being criminally charged with trying to defraud Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg out of half of the social media company was ordered on Tuesday to forfeit his bail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick in Manhattan entered a $250,000 judgment against Paul Ceglia's parents and brother after previously revoking his bail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Broderick said he might reduce the penalty if the family helps locate Ceglia, who disappeared more than two weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A prosecutor said Ceglia could face new fraud and bail jumping charges soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ceglia's father Carmine said he did not know where his son was but expressed sympathy for him, suggesting that Facebook's principal lawyer was unduly influencing federal prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I think he was afraid for his life that he wasn't going to get a fair shot," Carmine Ceglia said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook's lawyer had no immediate comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Paul Ceglia, 41, has been wanted since March 8 after his ankle bracelet was found removed at his Wellsville, New York, residence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.S. Marshals Service said Ceglia is believed to be traveling with his wife, two children and his dog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ceglia had been set to face trial May 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was first charged in 2012 for forging documents to extort Zuckerberg out of a 50 percent stake in Facebook, whose market value on Tuesday was more than $236 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The case stemmed from a 2010 lawsuit Ceglia filed against Facebook and Zuckerberg in Buffalo, New York, contending that Zuckerberg signed a contract while attending Harvard University giving Ceglia half of a planned social networking website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A federal judge last year dismissed Ceglia's lawsuit, finding the contract was doctored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ceglia is appealing, but a federal appeals court last week threatened to dismiss the case because of his fugitive status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At Tuesday's hearing, federal prosecutor Janis Echenberg said Ceglia may soon be charged with defrauding investors in the civil lawsuit out of $650,000, and also jumping bail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Gil Messina, a lawyer for Ceglia, said after the hearing that he and other lawyers were served on Monday with grand jury subpoenas that appeared connected to these new charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The case is U.S. v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ceglia, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>12-cr-00876.</td></tr>
