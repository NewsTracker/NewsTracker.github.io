<h3>Boston woman charged with fraudulently accepting benefits for marathon bombing injuries</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Joanna Leigh was indicted on charges of larceny and making a false claim to a government agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutors say she received $8,000 from The One Fund, a charity established to help bombing victims; $18,000 from a state victims' compensation fund; $9,000 from an online fundraiser; and $1,700 raised by students at a Boston school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Authorities say she was at the marathon in April 2013, but was not injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The 41-year-old Leigh says she suffered traumatic brain injuries, and the charges are retaliation for her criticism of The One Fund for not benefiting people with such injuries.</td></tr>
