<h3>AP source: Giants haven't rescinded JPP's franchise tag (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jason Pierre-Paul's future with the New York Giants remains uncertain after a fireworks accident, even though a person with knowledge of the contract tells The Associated Press the team has not rescinded its $14.8 million franchise tag offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the details of Pierre-Paul's contract situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The star defensive end was injured in an accident involving fireworks on July 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Given the accident, it's unlikely the Giants will sign Pierre-Paul to a long-term deal before the July 15 deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That would leave accepting the one-year offer as his only option if he wants to play in 2015, unless the Giants withdraw the offer and make him a free agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If Pierre-Paul signs the contract before training camp and the Giants determine he can't play, he could be placed on the non-football injury list and be forced to miss the first six games of the season without pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If he waits to prove he's healthy before signing the contract, Pierre-Paul could avoid landing on the non-football injury list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It's unlikely Pierre-Paul would refuse to sign the tender and sit out the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If so, however, he would become an unrestricted free agent and the Giants would maintain exclusive rights to sign him until the first day of the 2016 league year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Giants also could put the franchise tag on him again for 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Eli Manning, at a Louisiana passing academy he runs with his brother Peyton and their father Archie, said he hasn't had the opportunity to talk with Pierre-Paul but is hoping he can get healthy and play at a high level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''You've got to be smart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's unfortunate, and you don't know the whole story about how it all happened,'' the Giants quarterback said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Selected with the 15th overall pick in the 2010 NFL draft, Pierre-Paul didn't start any games his rookie season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He had a breakout year in 2011, posting a career-high 16 1/2 sacks and playing a key role in helping the Giants beat the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 26-year-old Pierre-Paul has 42 career sacks, including 12 1/2 last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Another NFL player also was injured in a similar accident last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The father of Tampa Bay cornerback C.J. Wilson told a Charlotte television station that his son lost two fingers in a July 4 fireworks accident.</td></tr>
