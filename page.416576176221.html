<tr><td>47</td><td>"They destroyed the city and they didn't wait for the investigation to occur," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"Now we don't have stores to go to. We don't have fast food we can eat at, because they've destroyed it all," Roy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The violence came about two weeks after Gray's arrest.</td></tr>

<tr><td>64</td><td>Demonstrations over Gray's death had been largely peaceful until Saturday, when 35 people were arrested and six officers injured.</td></tr>

<tr><td>66</td><td>"My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence?'" she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>"Freddie Gray would not want this. Freddie's father and mother do not want any violence. Violence does not get justice."</td></tr>

<tr><td>73</td><td>and Kweisi Mfume, formerly an NAACP leader and U.S representative from Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Screens on the church walls showed the words, "Black Lives Matter & All Lives Matter," which have become slogans at demonstrations around the country since a white police officer shot to death an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Mo., in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>That case was followed by demonstrations over the deaths of African Americans at the hands of police in New York City; Cleveland; Tulsa, Okla.; and South Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>"The eyes of this country are all on us, because they want to see whether we have the stuff to make this right," William Murphy Jr., a lawyer who is representing the Gray family, told the mourners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>"We need justice not just for Freddie Gray, for the Freddie Grays to come," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Another mourner was Erica Garner, 24, daughter of Eric Garner, who died in New York police custody while gasping, "I can't breathe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>His arrest was videotaped by a bystander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Erica Garner said she came to Baltimore after seeing video of Gray's arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>"It's like there is no accountability, no justice," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>"It's like we're back in the '50s, back in the Martin Luther King days. When is our day to be free going to come?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Hours later, on the city's bitter streets, looting erupted at an East Baltimore shopping center called Church Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Throngs of looters, mostly teenagers and young men, dashed into stores with an air of celebration and emerged with boxes of sneakers and armfuls of clothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Nearly an hour passed before police arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Substitute teacher Loren Braswell urged restraint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>"We got to think about what we're doing here," said Braswell, 53.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>"I love my city of Baltimore, but people got to think rationally and they're not doing that right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>But if the officers who caused Gray's death are not punished, Braswell said, "I think the city's going to burn down."</td></tr>
