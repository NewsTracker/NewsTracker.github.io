<h3>American blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The attack Thursday night on Avijit Roy, a Bangladesh-born U.S. citizen, occurred on a crowded sidewalk as he and his wife, Rafida Ahmed, were returning from a book fair at Dhaka University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ahmed, who is also a blogger, was seriously injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the latest in a series of attacks on secular writers in Bangladesh in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A previously unknown militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack, Assistant Police Commissioner S.M. Shibly Noman told the Prothom Alo newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Roy "was the target because of his crime against Islam," the group said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Roy was a prominent voice against religious intolerance, and his family and friends say he had been threatened for his writings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>About 8:45 p.m. Thursday, a group of men ambushed the couple as they walked toward a roadside tea stall, with at least two of the attackers hitting them with meat cleavers, police Chief Sirajul Islam said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The attackers then ran away, disappearing into the crowds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Two blood-stained cleavers were found after the attack, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Several hundred people joined a rally Friday near the site of the attack carrying banners reading, "We want justice" and "Down with fundamentalism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Islamic extremism has made few inroads in Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people, but there have been a series of similar attacks in recent years blamed on militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There has been an increasingly visible divide between secular bloggers and conservative Islamic groups, which are often covertly connected with Islamist parties, with the secularists urging authorities to ban religion-based politics while the Islamists press for blasphemy laws to protect their faith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Islam is Bangladesh's state religion but the country is governed by secular laws based on British common law, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly said she will not give in to religious extremism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Roy, an engineer by training, had founded a popular Bengali-language blog, Mukto-mona, or Free Mind, which featured articles on scientific reasoning and religion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The website has apparently been shut down since the attack, but Roy defended atheism in a January posting on Facebook, calling it "a rational concept to oppose any unscientific and irrational belief."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Anujit Roy, his younger brother, said Roy had returned to the country earlier this month from the U.S. and was planning to go back in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>His place of residence in the U.S. was not immediately available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In 2013, another blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haider, who also spoke out against religious extremism, was killed by still-unidentified assailants near his Dhaka home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In 2004, Humayun Azad, a prominent writer and teacher at Dhaka University, was seriously injured in an attack when he was returning from the same book fair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Baki Billah, a friend of Roy and a blogger, told Independent TV that Roy had been threatened earlier by people upset at his writing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"He was a free thinker. He was a Hindu but he was not only a strong voice against Islamic fanatics but also equally against other religious fanatics," Billah said.</td></tr>

<h3>58 gender options not enough? Facebook now allows unlimited custom identities</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After being told by users that its 58 existing gender options are not inclusive enough, the social network has relented and given its US-based members a chance to fill in their own gender as they wish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Now, if you do not identify with the pre-populated list of gender identities, you are able to add your own. As before, you can add up to 10 gender terms and also have the ability to control the audience with whom you would like to share your custom gender. We recognize that some people face challenges sharing their true gender identity with others, and this setting gives people the ability to express themselves in an authentic way," Facebook's Diversity team said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're hoping this will open up the dialogue," said Ari Chivukula, a transgender member of the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Post by Facebook Diversity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Among the list of existing US options are Two-Spirit, Pangender, Neutrois and Transmasculine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last summer, UK users were given additional options - including Hermaphrodite, and Two* Person - bringing up their total choices to over 70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But some still complained that the existing gender choices were restrictive and pigeon-holed people who may have a more uncertain conception of their own place on the gender spectrum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>For those, the new ability to self-define is empowering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"People are still fighting to make room for gender identity within the socially constructed binary of male and female. Labels and identities are powerful in that they give a sense of community, a way of articulating one's experience," Alison Fogarty, a gender identity researcher at Stanford University, told AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This helps to accelerate trans acceptance in our country. I'm excited about the future for gender identity," said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of LGBT group GLAAD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A UCLA study from 2011 estimated that about 700,000 US citizens are transgender - whether through gender reassignment surgery, or simply living as a different gender than the one identified at birth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Despite welcoming the change, Facebook user comments below the announcements complained that Facebook is still forcing its members to use real names - opening them up to potential abuse - and that people are only allowed to identify Male and Female in their potential partner preferences when filling in their profile forms.</td></tr>
