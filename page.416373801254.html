<tr><td>2</td><td>Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced on Monday that Australia's sole facility, at Hastings airfield, near Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, would close on April 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ms Bishop said the decision followed a process led by the government of Sierra Leone to rationalise and consolidate Ebola treatment centres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The number of new infections in Sierra Leone are decreasing, and there are now more treatment beds available than new patients in Sierra Leone," Ms Bishop said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Since opening in mid-December, the British-built, Australian-managed facility has admitted 216 patients, 36 of whom were successfully treated for Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A further 120 patients were monitored and discharged after testing negative for Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The earlier-than-expected closure of the facility will allow the Australian government to return $7.5 million of unspent funds to its emergency humanitarian fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Australia contributed a total of $37 million to the international Ebola response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ms Bishop congratulated Aspen Medical - the firm that Australia engaged to staff and manage the facility on its behalf - for the professional manner in which it had completed its task.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Over 250 Sierra Leonean staff have been trained at Australia's [Ebola treatment centre], building skills and capacity in Sierra Leone," Ms Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>No local or international staff employed at the centre contracted Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Three staff members were medically evacuated to the United Kingdom as a precaution but were later found not to have contracted the virus.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>Sierra Leone alone has recorded 12,201 cases and 3857 deaths.</td></tr>
