<h3>Iraq PM orders arrest of vandals in Tikrit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Security and military forces were ordered to "deal with cases of vandalism" carried out by "gangs" seeking to tarnish the achievements of government forces and allied paramilitaries, a statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Abadi also called on "forces located in Tikrit to arrest everyone who carries out such acts, and preserve properties and facilities in Salaheddin province," of which Tikrit is the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The statement did specify what prompted the orders, but militiamen have spray painted the names of their groups on homes, shops and other buildings, and also looted clothing and toiletries from shops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Policemen from the rapid response forces have written graffiti on walls in Tikrit as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Militiamen have also admitted to intentionally burning houses in other recaptured areas that were believed to have been used by IS or to belong to its supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A number of homes and businesses were burning in Tikrit earlier this week, though at least some of the fires were apparently related to efforts to clear the city of bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's top Shiite cleric who is revered by millions, called on security forces and allied paramilitaries to "preserve and guard citizens' properties in areas that have been liberated."</td></tr>
