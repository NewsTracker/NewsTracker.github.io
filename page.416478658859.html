<h3>Ukraine PM Says Welfare Boost Requires Economic Growth</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ukraine's prime minister says there will be no increase to welfare payments until the poverty-stricken country emerges from its security and economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Arseniy Yatsenyuk told lawmakers Friday that the immediate priority lay in restoring the health of the economy, which the International Monetary Fund sees shrinking by 5.5 percent this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The government believes Ukraine will return to growth in 2016, although that projection is hostage to events in industrial eastern regions where fighting continues against Russian-backed separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Yatsenyuk says the conflict that has raged over the past year has cost Ukraine the loss of one-fifth of its economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Efforts to pare back Ukraine's welfare system and sharp increases to utility prices mandated by international creditors are compounding pain in a country already blighted by deep poverty.</td></tr>
