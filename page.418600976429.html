<h3>Google self-driving car was rear-ended early July, causing injuries</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DETROIT - One of Google Inc's self-driving cars was involved in an accident early in July, in which three employees were injured when a vehicle equipped with Google technology was rear-ended by another vehicle, the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Several employees suffered minor whiplash in the July 1 incident, when a vehicle drove into the rear of a Lexus RX450h prototype - outfitted by Google with special sensors and software - which had stopped at a traffic light near the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, a Google spokesperson said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The employees were sent to a nearby hospital "as a precautionary measure" but were not admitted, the spokesperson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google said it was the first such incident involving injuries in a self-driving car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The technology giant, which started developing self-driving cars in 2009, said its prototype vehicles have been struck 14 times, including 11 rear-end collisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Google vehicle was not at fault in any of those incidents, the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Google disclosed the incident in a blog post on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Our self-driving cars are being hit surprisingly often by other drivers who are distracted and not paying attention to the road," wrote Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, in the blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The clear theme is human error and inattention" in those incidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google is testing a fleet of 23 specially equipped Lexus prototypes, and said it has logged more than 1 million test miles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last month, the company began testing tiny, bubble-shaped self-driving prototype vehicles of its own design on public roads around Mountain View.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The company has also started testing self-driving prototypes in Austin, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Google and other automotive manufacturers and suppliers have said the technology to build self-driving cars should be ready by 2020.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Urmson has said the company does not want to build its own self-driving cars, but would prefer to find a development and production partner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But most major multinational automakers are developing their own so-called automated vehicles that are designed to control major functions such as steering, brakes and throttle, without human effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Google self-driving cars have humans on board who can assume manual control of the vehicles if necessary.</td></tr>
