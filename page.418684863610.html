<h3>Chicago-area man accused of threatening Emanuel, others</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) " A driver for a ride-sharing service used his Facebook page to threaten Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and others, hinting that he hoped to commit an act of violence before traveling to Pakistan, according to a recently unsealed federal complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mohammad Waqas Khan, who is around 30 and from the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn, should remain behind bars pending trial, a U.S. magistrate judge ruled at a detention hearing Monday in Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Khan wrote on May 13 that Emanuel had "led the city of Chicago down the road to perdition," the complaint says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also calls the mayor and unnamed Chicago aldermen "rabid dogs," and adds, "You shall be taught a lesson you will not forget!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Khan also allegedly expressed disgust with American and Pakistani politicians, though no one else is mentioned by name in the complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Defense attorney Ellen Domph told Monday's hearing that Khan's words weren't serious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She even suggested they could have been rap lyrics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The complaint isn't clear about possible motives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It quotes several messages in which Khan seems to suggest he wanted acts of violence that would draw widespread attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On May 7 he wrote, "I'm not killin sum bum on the street. I want a net worth individual to shoot. I want this to be a real human tragedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 10-page complaint describes federal surveillance of Khan, including as he picked up and drove ride-share customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His arrest in mid-May, the complaint suggests, was hastened by his purchase of a plane ticket to fly from Chicago to Pakistan on June 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He allegedly wrote on Facebook, "I'm not leaving America without getting revenge even if it costs me my life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The complaint says the DuPage County Sherriff's Office first arrested Khan on May 14, including on charges he had a loaded semi-automatic pistol in his car in violation of Illinois' concealed-carry law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was later charged federally with transmitting a threatening communication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The complaint gives Khan's age as 29, though the Federal Bureau of Prisons record indicates he is 30.</td></tr>
