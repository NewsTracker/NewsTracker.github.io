<h3>Israelis go to the polls</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The outcome of the race, in which opinion polls suggest Netanyahu will win fewer seats than the centre-left Zionist Union, is likely to help determine the prospects for new Middle East peace talks and Israel's troubled relations with its US ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Around six million voters are eligible to take part in the election for Israel's 120 members of parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Polls close at 2000 GMT (0700 AEDT) with exit polls by Israel's main media outlets set to give the first indications of the likely outcome minutes afterwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu brought the election on himself, calling the snap vote after firing centrist ministers from his fractious coalition just two years into its term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It will be Israel's third election since 2009 and the biggest challenge yet for the 65-year-old incumbent, who is seeking a third consecutive term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Final opinion polls published on Friday gave the Zionist Union of Labour leader Isaac Herzog a three to four seat lead over Netanyahu's Likud party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the surveys also suggested Netanyahu will have an advantage when it comes to piecing together a coalition with smaller allies from the right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As he cast his own ballot on Tuesday, Netanyahu ruled out any alliance with Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There will not be a unity government with Labour. I will form a national (rightwing) government," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Netanyahu has warned a vote for the Zionist Union could endanger Israel's security and lead to the division of Jerusalem and the establishment of a Palestinian state in the annexed eastern sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Monday he was asked by the rightwing NRG website if it was true that there would be no Palestinian state established if he was reelected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Indeed," said Netanyahu, who in 2009 had endorsed the idea of two states living side by side.</td></tr>

<h3>Activist allegedly tried to bait protesters with ?kill cops? script</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A former top staffer with Project Veritas, Richard Valdes, said the incident occurred in January, when an undercover operative assigned to infiltrate the protest groups was given a script that included the startling comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Valdes said he was fired by the group's founder, James O'Keefe, for not following through on the bizarre assignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Valdes said Veritas assigned a Muslim undercover agent pretending to be anti-cop to attend protest meetings and utter the following statement: "Sometimes, I wish I could just kill some of these cops. Don't you just wish we could have one of the cops right here in the middle of our group?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the undercover agent refused, according to Valdes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I will not say words that will jeopardize my entity, especially when they involve an illegal act of 'murdering police,' " the agent wrote in a Jan. 9 e-mail to Valdes and cc'd to O'Keefe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Valdes claims O'Keefe, known for hidden-camera tactics against liberal groups, fired him "because he was unhappy with me for being unwilling to strong-arm the guy to do his dirty work."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Valdes and his lawyer, Arthur Schwartz, are threatening to sue for wrongful termination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Project Veritas would never do anything that we believe would incite violence against police officers. Anyone suggesting otherwise is clearly unfamiliar with our body of work," Veritas spokesman Dan Pollack said.</td></tr>
