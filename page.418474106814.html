<h3>Greece closer to desperately needed deal with creditors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, speaks with French President Francois Hollande, center, and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras during a meeting of eurozone heads of state at the EU Council building in Brussels on Sunday, July 12, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Skeptical European creditors raced Sunday to narrow differences both among themselves and with Athens, aiming to come up with a tentative agreement to stave off an immediate financial collapse in Greece that would reverberate across the continent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) - Greece moved closer on Sunday to a desperately needed deal with European creditors which would stave off immediate financial collapse and the country's potential exit from the euro but impose more hardship on its people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Facing a self-imposed Sunday deadline, the eurozone's top official, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said the sides have "come a long way" after two days of talks among finance ministers, but that the final effort on "some big issues" would be handled by eurozone leaders in a summit which was expected to go into the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Underscoring the optimism despite the often fundamental differences among the leaders, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said "we are very close."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The broad outline of a deal appeared to consist of a long series commitments from Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to push through much of a drastic austerity program within days, while the 18 other eurozone leaders would commit to start talks on a new bailout program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a four-page draft proposal put to eurozone leaders and obtained by The Associated Press, language up for discussion spoke of a potential "time out from the euro area" for Greece if no agreement could be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It highlighted the increasing frustration with Greece during five months of fruitless talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Sunday, doubts on the Greek government's commitment to implement tough measures continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The most important currency has been lost: that is trust and reliability," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, reflecting on five months of tortuous negotiations with Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the draft document, Greece committed itself to pushing a first set of measures through parliament by Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Despite the stinging conditions on pension, market and privatization reforms, Tsipras insisted his government was ready to clinch a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We owe that to the peoples of Europe who want Europe united and not divided," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We can reach an agreement tonight if all parties want it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Greece has asked Europe's bailout fund for a 53.5 billion-euro ($59.5 billion) 3-year financial package but many officials in Brussels say the figure will have to be much higher and insist on tough Greek austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This would be Greece's third bailout in five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greece desperately needs help to avoid a financial collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The economy is in freefall and the country faces big debt repayments in the coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Greek banks have been shuttered for the best part of two weeks and daily withdrawals from ATMs have been limited to a paltry 60 euros ($67).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The banks, according to some accounts, have barely enough cash to last through the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Merkel, however, insisted that Germany would not sway from its stance that Greece needs to do much more to get any help just to save its position in the 19-nation eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"There will not an agreement at all costs," she said, coming into Sunday's summit meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Nerves are tense."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Highlighting the differences within the creditors' camp, French President Francois Hollande insisted it was vital to keep Greece in the currency club and avoid a so-called "Grexit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>If Greece had to leave the euro currency "it's Europe that would go backward," Hollande said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"And that I do not want."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>France is considered Greece's closest ally and even helped Tsipras prepare the reform proposals that were a minimum requirement for getting fresh talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb, one of Greece's most outspoken critics, said a package of proposals sent to the leaders involved three key elements, including the Greek parliament's passing of a series of unspecified laws by Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>If these conditions are met, then talks with Europe's bailout fund can proceed, Stubb said.</td></tr>
