<h3>'We Need Help': Aid scarce in quake-hit Nepal villages</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Nepalese boy stands outside his village with a signboard asking for help in Pauwathok village, Sindhupalchok district, Nepal, Saturday, May 2, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Life has been slowly returning to normal in Kathmandu, but to the east, angry villagers in parts of the Sindhupalchok district said Saturday they were still waiting for aid to reach them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the village of Pauwathok, where all but a handful of the 85 houses were destroyed, three trucks apparently carrying aid supplies roared by without stopping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>PAUWATHOK, Nepal (AP) - At the entrance of this destroyed mountain village, a wooden sign stands, cobbled together from debris of homes flattened by Nepal's devastating earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Its message: "WE NEED HELP. PLEASE HELP."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A steep winding road leads up to the ruins of the small village of Pauwathok, perched on a ridge about 3,600 feet (1,100 meters) above sea level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It's just 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Kathmandu, Nepal's capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But villagers say not one government official, not one soldier has visited since the massive quake struck a week ago, underscoring just how unprepared and overwhelmed Nepal's government has been.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Early Saturday, a convoy of covered trucks approached Pauwathok.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The trucks were apparently transporting aid and escorted by Nepalese police carrying automatic weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hungry residents ran toward the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The trucks were not stopping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Are we invisible to you?!" a voice among the crowd screamed as the trucks rode slowly up a hill and out of sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>One week after the strongest tremor to hit impoverished Nepal in eight decades, aid has been slow in reaching those who need it most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In many places it has not come at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>U.N. humanitarian officials said Saturday they are increasingly worried about the spread of disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They said more helicopters are needed to reach isolated mountain villages like Pauwathok, which were hard to access even before the quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The true extent of the damage from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake is still unknown as reports keep filtering in from remote areas, some of which remain entirely cut off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.N. has estimated the quake affected 8.1 million people - more than a quarter of Nepal's 28 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The government's latest number, reported Sunday, is 7,040 dead, with little hope of finding survivors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Nepal has been shaken by more than 70 aftershocks, and its people remain on edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>One brief aftershock Sunday afternoon shook this village's only paved road, triggering screams from residents who began to run, then stopped when the tremor eased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Pauwathok is located in the district of Sindupalchok, where more deaths have been recorded than anywhere else in Nepal - 2,560, compared to 1,622 in Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The U.N. says up to 90 percent of the houses in Sindupalchok have been destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Rajaram Giri said he was sitting under a large tree when the big quake hit April 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Pauwakthok was immediately engulfed in clouds of red dust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>When it cleared, Giri saw only ruins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Only a handful of the village's roughly 80 homes remain habitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Mostly made of brick and mud and sticks, they were either completely leveled or damaged beyond repair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Some families now sleep under makeshift shelters of debris that they constructed from their own ruined homes - torn roofs and boards, whatever was left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Others sleep under tarpaulins - obtained only after residents sat in the middle of the road Friday and blocked an aid convoy that eventually relinquished 30 of them, said Giri, who took one for his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Volunteers have begun stepping into the void.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Late Saturday, Pauwathok's appeal for help was finally answered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A truck full of rice, noodles and medical supplies pulled up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Everyone crowded round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The truck had been organized by a teacher who went for help to Kathmandu, where he collected donations from charities and friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>They brought the aid themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"The government has not been able to cater to the needs of everyone, so it's better if everybody can pitch in," said Supral Raj Joshi, who helped bring the aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"It's not that the government isn't trying, it's that they've not been able to reach everywhere."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Six other civilians, several of whom worked with street kids in Kathmandu, also came to deliver medical aid Saturday.</td></tr>
