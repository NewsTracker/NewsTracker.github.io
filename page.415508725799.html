<h3>What Cockroaches With Backpacks Can Do. Ah-mazing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They're attracted to filth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They frighten people, even give them nightmares.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But for a team of scientists at Texas A&M University, the roach is a hero: the first animal that humans might successfully transform into a robot, a hybrid of insect and machine that we can send anywhere to be our eyes and ears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Professor Hong Liang opens the door to a small laboratory with hundreds, maybe thousands, of cockroaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's not for the faint of heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"So they're all here," she whispers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It's dark in here - the way they like it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If you're quiet, you can hear them squirming, chewing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They sound almost like children sucking lollipops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Liang's colleague, Professor S. Bradley Vinson, reaches into a plastic container where roaches are hiding between wood chips, searching for one with his bare hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"There's one nice cockroach," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"See how pretty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's huge: 2 inches long, an inch wide, with a hard black and gold shell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bradley turns it upside down and its six legs kick around, the hairy, prickly spines searching for something to clasp onto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They don't bite," Liang says reassuringly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This breed from Latin America is slower than the ones you might see crawling under your refrigerator, but also much stronger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This is probably one of the larger roaches - and could pick up, you know put a heavier pack on it," Vinson says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"And it would be the ideal starting point for all this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A "pack" as in a backpack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Vinson is an entomologist - an insect expert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Liang is a mechanical engineer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The point of their work is to build the perfect cockroach cyborg: an animal that can crawl into tiny holes and around jagged edges with recording equipment, for surveillance, for example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Or, if there's an earthquake and a building crashes, Liang says, deploy them to the second floor for search and rescue, "so when they reach there, they can work as a vehicle. If they can carry any sensors, cameras, they can collect information for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Her team recently had a breakthrough, which they describe in a paper for the Royal Society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Since at least the 1990s, scientists around the world have been trying to control the movement of roaches by planting electrodes into their antennae and sending little shocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>These shocks serve to make them think a predator is coming from the left, and so prompt them to go right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The problem is that roaches stop listening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We're trying to override the natural instincts of insects," says Alper Bozkurt, a leading researcher at North Carolina State University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Another team of scientists has worked on building an invisible fence to keep these insect robot hybrids inside a designated area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"They're pretty smart," says Texas A&M Ph.D. student Carlos Sanchez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"In addition to that, in the wild they lose their antennae pretty frequently anyway, so they learn to adapt, to survive without using an antenna."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Texas A&M switched up the placement of the electrodes, putting them into the "ganglion" - a cluster of neurons that controls the roach's front legs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That way, the shock forces the roach to lose balance and move in the direction desired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Liang says now the roach is following commands about 60 percent of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The other 40 percent it does nothing or moves in the wrong direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"The goal is 100 percent," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"We are confident we're going to reach there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Next door, the roaches get outfitted with backpacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Sanchez sprays carbon dioxide gas on a roach to put it to sleep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It curls up, as if it were assuming the fetal position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He uses an acupuncture needle to puncture the mini-brain and insert electrodes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Asked if it hurts the roach, he says, "I don't think so. I haven't heard any complaints from them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Scientists doubt that roaches feel pain like humans do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>While we both have nerves, roaches' brains are much smaller and the connection between their neurons and muscles are much simpler, Vinson says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"So they probably don't remember pain."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Sanchez brushes whiteout on the hard shell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>It acts like glue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>He mounts a chip the size of a quarter, securing it to the roach's body with grafting tape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The backpack syncs with his remote controller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>He's ready to play - that is, direct the roach on the floor - like a video game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>He presses left and right to illustrate: "Usually if you stimulate both sides it stops."</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>When he presses just right, the roach swerves along in that direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Somehow, in this well-lit laboratory, the roach is becoming less creepy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>With its potential to go anywhere, collect audio and video in real time, I kind of want it on my team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"Do you feel better about cockroaches right now?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Liang asks me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>"Less freaky?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Her question is a setup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>"Maybe we could give it a try."</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>In the spirit of science, I agree to let the roach crawl on me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>We put my arm flush against a table, and Sanchez places the animal just above my wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>I feel its prickly spines crawling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>But then, suddenly, it stops responding to signals and nests in my forearm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>It could be sensory overload.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>With the lights shining, the smell of human skin, all of us talking at once, Vinson says, "The environment is going to have a big effect on him, especially since he's been working out here for quite a while."</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Liang and I want to keep trying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>We suggest shutting off the lights, to remove one variable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>But Vinson and Sanchez say no.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>The roach has had a long day and deserves to rest.</td></tr>
