<h3>Greek market to remain closed on Monday: Official sources</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Inside the Athens stock exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Greek stock exchange will remain closed on Monday but might reopen on Tuesday after a one-month shutdown, official sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's certain that it will not open on Monday, maybe on Tuesday," a spokesperson for the Athens Stock Exchange told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Another person with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed that Greek authorities aimed to reopen the bourse on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The stock market has been closed since June 29 when Athens shut its stricken banks and imposed capital controls to stem a run on deposits that threatened to collapse the tottering Greek financial system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The shutdown has put at risk the bourse's place in global securities indices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Banks reopened last Monday and Greece submitted a plan to the European Central Bank last week for an opinion before a decision was made by the Greek finance ministry which would allow the stock market to resume trading as early as Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Athens Stock Exchange official said Greece needed more time to finalise the details which would allow the market to reopen based on ECB's opinion.</td></tr>
