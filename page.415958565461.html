<h3>Netanyahu: Iran must recognize Israel's right to exist</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(CNN)Slamming world powers' framework nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday demanded that any final deal include a "clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel's right to exist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu has been perhaps the most vocal critic of nuclear talks with Iran, insisting again and again it can't be trusted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He took his case to the U.S. Congress last month, at a time before negotiators had hammered out any sort of agreement, over the objections of President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There's never been any dispute about his take, but the Prime Minister has sharpened his rhetoric in recent days, saying the deal increases the risk of a "horrific war."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Netanyahu has lobbied hard for a deal that dismantles and disassembles Iran's nuclear infrastructure -- rather than limiting its usage or repurposing Iran's facilities -- but such stipulations were not part of the framework agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the absence of both elements, Netanyahu is calling the emerging deal a historic mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After an emergency Cabinet meeting Friday afternoon hours before the Jewish holiday of Passover, Netanyahu said the agreement "would pose a grave danger to the region and to the world and would threaten the very survival of the state of Israel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>" ... I want to make clear to all: The survival of Israel is non-negotiable," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Israel will not accept an agreement which allows a country that vows to annihilate us to develop nuclear weapons, period."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Obama called Netanyahu after Thursday's announcement of the framework agreement to reassure him that Israel's security will remain a prime concern in the ensuing negotiations and the final deal, which faces a June 30 deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"There is no daylight when it comes to our support for Israel's security," Obama said, reaffirming the American commitment to Israel's security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But Netanyahu said he isn't convinced Israel is safe from Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Just two days ago, Iran said that 'the destruction of Israel is non-negotiable.' And in these fateful days Iran is accelerating the arming of its terror proxies to attack Israel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Israeli leader added that "this deal would legitimize Iran's nuclear program, bolster Iran's economy and increase Iran's aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond."</td></tr>
