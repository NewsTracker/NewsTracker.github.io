<h3>Court questions Google on patent values in Microsoft case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court appeared skeptical on Wednesday toward Google Inc's bid to charge Microsoft Corp a high royalty rate to use some of the Internet search provider's Motorola Mobility patents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Microsoft sued Motorola in 2010, alleging Motorola breached its commitment to license some of its industry standard patents on fair terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After a 2012 trial, a Seattle federal judge found that the appropriate rate for Motorola to license certain wireless and video technology used in the Xbox game console was only a fraction of what Motorola had asked for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google sold the Motorola handset business to Lenovo last year, but kept its patents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The value of Google's patents can affect how it negotiates royalty rates with other tech companies, and firms including Apple Inc and Intel Corp filed court papers supporting Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After the 2012 trial before U.S. District Judge James Robart, the judge said the appropriate royalty rate was about $1.8 million, slightly above Microsoft's estimate, but well below Motorola's demand for as much as $4 billion a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Google asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday to rule that the patent rate should have been determined by a jury, not the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, all three members of the 9th Circuit panel suggested that Google's attorneys had not sought a jury trial on that issue at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It seems pretty clear...that both parties anticipated a bench trial," Chief Judge Sidney Thomas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After Robart set the patent rate, a jury in 2013 awarded Microsoft about $14.5 million in damages for breach of contract in a subsequent trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Google has asked that the 9th Circuit reverse that award as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The 9th Circuit is expected to rule sometime in the coming months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The case in the 9th Circuit is Microsoft Corporation vs. Motorola Mobility Inc. et al, 14-35393.</td></tr>
