<h3>Guinea Ebola cases climb due to transmissions at funerals</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinea has seen a spate of new Ebola cases due to transmissions at funerals, a worrying sign for the African nation as it seeks to stamp out a year-long epidemic that has killed over 11,000 people across the region, a health official said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to figures released on Tuesday by the special government department set up to fight the disease, treatment clinics were handling just eight confirmed Ebola cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Today we have 27 sick in our treatment centres, including 18 confirmed cases," the department's spokesman Fode Tass Sylla told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Yesterday alone we recorded five sick."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sylla said all the new patients had contracted the disease at funeral ceremonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ebola is transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of those infected or the bodies of those who have died of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Health officials in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have carried out wide-reaching information campaigns to warn of the risks of improperly burying victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, they have often met with resistance from those who believe the restrictions infringe upon traditional practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Liberia last week became the first of the three hardest hit countries to be declared free of the disease, having completed a 42-day period without a new case of Ebola.</td></tr>
