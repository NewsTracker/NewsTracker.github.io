<h3>Pitchers and catchers report this week to spring training</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Matt Harvey continues his comeback with the New York Mets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Joe Maddon takes over the Chicago Cubs, and Russell Martin gets a closer look at Toronto's pitching staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While much of the Northeast and Midwest navigates bitter cold and piles of snow, spring training begins in earnest this week when pitchers and catchers file into camps in Florida and Arizona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>World Champion San Francisco is one of four National League teams slated to begin on Thursday, and most of the majors' pitchers and backstops will be in place by this weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Following several massive free-agent deals and blockbuster trades, there are plenty of compelling story lines heading into baseball's first spring training since Rob Manfred took over as commissioner in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Nationals strengthened their already solid rotation by signing free agent Max Scherzer to a $210 million, seven-year contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Now the pressure is on Scherzer to deliver on that big deal and help the reigning NL East champions advance deep into the playoffs for the first time since the franchise moved to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While Scherzer will attract plenty of attention this spring, it looks as if Tanner Roark will have to adjust to a bullpen role after he had a breakout season a year ago, winning 15 games with a sparking 2.85 ERA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The right-hander is a nice insurance policy for manager Matt Williams should any of the starters get hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Harvey missed all of last season for his recovery from elbow ligament-replacement surgery, and got an early start on spring training by reporting to New York's facility about two weeks before the first scheduled workout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He is hoping to be ready for opening day, but the Mets could decide on a slow and steady approach for the ace right-hander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's a brand new day for the Cubs when they report to Arizona after a banner offseason that included the addition of Maddon, who had a 754-705 record during his successful nine-year run with Tampa Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Cubs President Theo Epstein pounced on the quirky skipper after he opted out of his contract with the Rays, dumping Rick Renteria after just one season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Epstein is counting on Maddon to ease the transition of the organization's impressive stable of prospects to the rigors of the majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Cubs were one of baseball's most active teams over the winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Same goes for Toronto, which is seeking its first playoff appearance since it won the World Series in 1993.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Martin was one of the majors' most prized free agents over the winter, and he opted for an $82 million, five-year contract with the Blue Jays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The three-time All-Star, who was born in Toronto and raised in Montreal, hit .290 with 11 home runs and 67 RBIs with Pittsburgh last season, helping the Pirates to a second straight playoff berth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The last team to win consecutive World Series was the New York Yankees from 1998-2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The next team to take a crack that feat is San Francisco, which beat Kansas City in seven games for the title last fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The good news for the Giants is they have plenty of experience when it comes to defending the title, having also won the World Series in 2010 and 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But they failed to make the playoffs following each of their previous two championships, slipping to a 76-86 record in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>One spot to watch this spring is third base, where Casey McGehee replaces Pablo Sandoval after the slugger signed a $95 million, five-year deal with Boston over the winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Madison Bumgarner returns after throwing a whopping 270 innings last year, and Matt Cain is back after he had surgery in August to remove bone chips from his right elbow.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt's Sisi urges U.N. mandate for Libya coalition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"There is no other choice, taking into account the agreement of the Libyan people and government and that they call on us to act," he told France's Europe 1 radio in an interview aired on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have to work together to defeat terrorism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Egypt directly intervened for the first time in the conflict in neighbouring Libya on Monday after an Islamic State group in the country released a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sisi said a 2011 NATO operation, which played a critical role in toppling Muammar Gaddafi, was an "unfinished mission".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Western alliance imposed a no-fly zone on Libya and used air power to try to prevent Gaddafi's forces attacking civilian areas held by rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But it then did little to prevent the country sliding into anarchy and chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We abandoned the Libyan people as prisoners to extremist militias," the Egyptian president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting on Wednesday on the situation in Libya, Egypt's foreign minister met on Tuesday with ambassadors from the council's five veto-wielding powers - the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki noted the U.N. meeting and said, "Obviously, we all have a concern about the threat of (Islamic State) and there will be a range of proposals put out there, but we're not going to get ahead of any process."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The United States, Italy, France, Britain, Spain and Germany issued a statement on Tuesday saying a U.N.-led process to establish a national unity government in Libya provided the best hope for confronting the country's violence and instability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Libya is separated from the Italian island of Sicily by only a few hundred kilometres of sea, and has been the launch point in recent years for hundreds of thousands of African and Middle East migrants seeking a better life in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti have both said Rome would be ready to join any military intervention, but Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has struck a more cautious note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Vatican's top diplomat urged "a response agreed to by the diplomatic community under the auspices of the United Nations and as rapidly as possible".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After a meeting with Italy's president and prime minister, Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin said that "any armed intervention must be done according to the norms of international law and therefore under a U.N. initiative".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Pope Francis expressed deep sadness on Monday at the killing of the Coptic Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Speaking in the past about Islamic State, he has said it is "lawful" to stop an unjust aggressor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sisi urged the outside world to send weapons to Libya's internationally recognised government, which is based in the eastern city of Bayda after rivals seized power in Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Bayda government has also asked for the lifting of an arms embargo to help it take back control of the country.</td></tr>
