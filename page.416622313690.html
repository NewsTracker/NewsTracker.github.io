<tr><td>7</td><td>The 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook Nepal's capital and the densely populated Kathmandu valley on Saturday devastating the region and leaving tens of thousands shell-shocked and sleeping in streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The first supplies of food aid began reaching remote, earthquake-shattered mountain villages in Nepal, while thousands clamored to board buses out of Kathmandu, either to check on rural relatives or for fear of spending yet another night in the damaged capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Frustration over the slow delivery of humanitarian aid boiled over in a protest in the city, with about 200 people facing off with police and blocking traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The protest was comparatively small and no demonstrators were detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But it reflected growing anger over bottlenecks that delayed much-needed relief days after the powerful earthquake that killed more than 5,500 people, injured twice that many and left tens of thousands homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Police, meanwhile, arrested dozens of people on suspicion of looting or causing panic by spreading rumors of another big quake.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>Women greeted the delivery with repeated cries of "We are hungry!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>While the death toll in the village of Gumda was low - only five people were killed and 20 were injured among 1,300 residents - most had lost their homes and desperately needed temporary shelter, along with the 40-kilogram (90-pound) sacks of rice that were delivered Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Adding to residents' misery was the rain that has fallen periodically since the quake and hampered helicopter aid flights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The U.N. World Food Program warned that it will take time for food and other supplies to reach more remote communities that have been cut off by landslides.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>"I am hoping to get on a bus, any bus heading out of Kathmandu. I am too scared to be staying in Kathmandu," said Raja Gurung, who wanted to get to his home in western Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The house near my rented apartment collapsed. It was horrible. I have not gone indoors in many days. I would rather leave than live a life of fear in Kathmandu."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Despite Wednesday's small protest, there were signs that life was inching back to normal in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Banks opened for a few hours and refilled their ATMs with cash, some shops reopened and vendors returned to the streets.</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>"My nails went all white and my lips cracked ... I was sure no one was coming for me. I was certain I was going to die."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The 27-year-old Khanal, whose foot was crushed under the debris, said he was surrounded by bodies and kept banging on the rubble until a French rescue team pulled him out.</td></tr>
