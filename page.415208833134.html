<h3>Mexico authorities arrest Zetas drug cartel leader Omar Trevino</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The interior of the house where Omar Trevino, alleged leader of Los Zetas drug cartel, was arrested near Monterrey in Nuevo Leon state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was captured without any shots being fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>MEXICO CITY?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mexican police and soldiers on Wednesday captured Omar Trevino, widely considered to be the most important leader of the Zetas drug cartel that once carved a path of brutal bloodshed along the country?s northern border with the U.S., a federal official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name because of government policy, said the man known as ?Z-42?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>was arrested in a predawn raid in San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy suburb of the northern city of Monterrey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Mexican government had offered a $2 million reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had offered a $5 million reward for his capture, saying he was wanted on drug-trafficking charges, but listed ?Omar?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>as an alias and his given name as Alejandro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>DEA spokesman Rusty Payne confirmed they are the same person and said ?we certainly are excited and congratulate Mexico for another great arrest.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico?s most violent cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Miguel Angel Trevino was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano ?El Lazca.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Omar apparently took over leadership of the Zetas?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>a gang originally formed by deserters from an elite army unit?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>after his brother?s arrest in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Zetas left a trail of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But much of the violence along Mexico?s northeast border now is due to internal battles among Gulf cartel factions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The capture of Omar Trevino follows Friday?s arrest of another big cartel leader, Servando Gomez, known as ?La Tuta.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Gomez allegedly led the Knights Templar, a pseudo-religious drug gang that built up control of many sectors of the economy in the western state of Michoacan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The two arrests provided much-needed good news for the administration of Enrique Pe?a Nieto, battered by a series of scandals in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The government needed to show that some of its policies were successful,?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>said Raul Benitez, a security expert at Mexico?s National Autonomous University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Like Servando Gomez, Omar Trevino was captured without any shots being fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Trevino Morales brothers took proceeds from their U.S. drug sales and laundered them by purchasing American quarter horses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A jury in Texas found a third brother, Jose Trevino, guilty in May of investing $16 million of drug money in the buying, training and racing of horses across the Southwest United States.</td></tr>
