<h3>Russian security service chief says several suspects in Nemtsov case: report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday called the slaying of his top critic a "disgrace" to Russia, while the opposition promised to complete Boris Nemtsov's work on a report documenting evidence of Russian troops' involvement in fighting in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr. Putin condemned the slaying of Mr. Nemtsov, who was gunned down while walking on a bridge next to the Kremlin late Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Russian leader had sent his condolences to Mr. Nemtsov's mother, but his comments Wednesday were his first public remarks on the subject.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The most serious attention must be paid to high-profile crimes, including those with a political motive," Mr. Putin said in televised remarks to top officials of the Interior Ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We must finally rid Russia of the disgrace and tragedy of the kinds of things we recently saw and experienced: I mean the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov in the very centre of the capital."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr. Nemtsov, 55, one of Mr. Putin's most vehement critics, was killed just hours after a radio interview in which he denounced the President for his "mad, aggressive" policies in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Before his death, he was working on a report about Russian involvement in the war in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Opposition activist Ilya Yashin said police had seized computers and documents during searches in Mr. Nemtsov's apartment in Moscow and his office in Yaroslavl, where he worked as a regional lawmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Mr. Yashin told the Associated Press that he and other friends of Mr. Nemtsov have found some fragments related to the report and hope to work on them and publish a report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He has kept his materials in different places, including with his associates and friends, and we have managed to get access to some of them," Mr. Yashin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We will try to restore bits and pieces of the work that Boris has started but failed to complete, and we will do everything to bring this work to the end, so that the report will see the light. It's very important for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On his Facebook page, Mr. Yashin posted a picture of what he said was Mr. Nemtsov's handwritten note, saying he was contacted by paratroopers from a unit that lost 17 men but who were afraid to speak publicly on the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ukraine and the West have accused Moscow of backing the pro-Russia rebellion in eastern Ukraine with troops and weapons - accusations the Kremlin has denied even though NATO said it had satellite pictures proving Russia's involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>No suspects have been detained yet in the killing, despite an offer of nearly $50,000 (U.S.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>for information related to the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earlier on Wednesday, the director of Russia's Federal Security Service said that an investigation had identified several suspects, without giving details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr. Putin dubbed Mr. Nemtsov's killing a "provocation," and nationwide TV networks quickly followed up, blaming Western intelligence agencies, Ukrainian agents or even the opposition.</td></tr>
