<h3>Mohamed Morsi lawyers appeal against death sentence in Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lawyers representing the ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi have filed an appeal against his death sentence and prison term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Morsi, who was toppled by the army in July 2013, was sentenced to death in June for allegedly participating in prison breaks and violence against police, and to life in prison for espionage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Morsi was detained without charge during the initial days of the 2011 uprising against the country's veteran leader Hosni Mubarak, and escaped along with thousands of others after protesters attacked police stations across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He had faced no legal action for leaving the prison either before or during his tenure as president, which began in June 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Morsi has spent the past two years in jail since being ousted from power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We submitted an appeal to the court of cassation to all prisoners sentenced, including Morsi," said his state-appointed legal representative Abdel Moneim Abdel Maqsud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Morsi has not appointed a lawyer to defend himself and has refused to recognise the legitimacy of the court proceedings, saying he remains Egypt's legitimate president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hundreds of Islamists have been sentenced to death in a crackdown following Morsi's overthrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Most have won retrials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Seven have been executed, including six defendants sentenced to death by a military court for allegedly participating in militant attacks.</td></tr>
