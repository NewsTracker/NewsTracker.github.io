<h3>Ebola: Sierra Leone plans second lockdown to stem epidemic</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The worst-ever outbreak of the virus has claimed almost 3,700 lives in the impoverished west African nation, one of three countries that have seen their economies wrecked and healthcare systems obliterated in the crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The lockdown will be conducted from 27 March to 29 March and will be like the one we conducted in September last year," Palo Conteh, head of the National Ebola Response Centre, said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The government and partners are hopeful that latent cases that are now not being reported or recorded will come out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The action, which follows a nationwide lockdown in September, was announced after the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Wednesday that the death toll from Ebola stood at almost 10,200.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One of the deadliest viruses known to man, Ebola is spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the recently deceased or an infected person showing symptoms such as fever or vomiting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities will use the 72-hour window to search out patients in the Western Area, which includes Freetown as well as the northern districts of Bombali and Port Loko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Teams of experts will go door-to-door reminding households of the dangers of traditional burials, a key factor in the spread of the virus, and investigating deaths not reported to the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Authorities hope the lockdown will set the country back on course to meet a mid-April deadline for eradicating Ebola, as announced by the leaders of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"People have become complacent and are still touching corpses, washing bodies and taking sick people to traditional healers," Conteh told reporters in Freetown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are determined to bring Ebola to an end and meet the deadline set by the presidents for 15 April. This is what we are working towards."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The lockdown follows a two-week door-to-door operation February in Port Loko, a coastal district immediately north and east of the Western Area, to find out if families were harbouring patients or concealing bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Wednesday the WHO reported 150 new confirmed cases in the week to Sunday, compared with 116 the previous week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There were 95 new confirmed infections in Guinea - the highest weekly total for the country in 2015 - but Sierra Leone is faring better, according the WHO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The country reported 55 new confirmed cases, the lowest weekly total since late June 2014, and WHO chief Margaret Chan said on Wednesday it had made "tremendous progress" in combating Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Freetown reported 29 of the infections, while 17 were registered in Bombali and Port Loko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A country or region is considered to have eradicated Ebola after 42 days - double the maximum incubation period for the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>More than 300 healthcare workers have been infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone, and almost three-quarters have died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>An American healthcare worker who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone is critical and 10 colleagues are being monitored for signs of illness in the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The regional success story remains Liberia, which has reported no new confirmed cases for the third consecutive week.</td></tr>

<h3>Carnufex carolinesis, the 9-feet long crocodile that hunted on two legs before the dinosaurs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Carnufex carolinensis, which means 'Carolina Butcher' due to its ferocious appearance, was an early ancestor of modern crocodiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Paleontologists believe it roamed the warm, wet rainforests of what is now North Carolina around 231 million years ago, preying upon small armoured reptiles and early mammals with its powerful jaws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Researchers discovered fossilised parts of the ferocious crocodilian's skull, spine and forelimbs in a rock formation in Chatham County, close to Sanford, North Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dr Lindsay Zanno, assistant research professor at North Carolina State University and director of the palaeontology lab at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, said the fossil could help provide new clues about the evolution of crocodiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>WHAT WAS CARNUFEX?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Running on its hind legs, Carnufex would have been the top predator in the area during the Triassic period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She said: 'Fossils from this time period are extremely important to scientists because they record the earliest appearance of crocodylomorphs and theropod dinosaurs, two groups that first evolved in the Triassic period, yet managed to survive to the present day in the form of crocodiles and birds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The scientists, whose work is published in the journal Scientific Reports, used high-resolution scanning techniques to reconstruct Carnufex's skull from the fossil fragments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They found that the skull was unexepectedly slender, at least 50cm in length, with an ornamented boss running across the top of the skull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They said that Carnufex is one of the world's earliest and largest early crocodile ancestors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At the time it was alive North Carolina was part of a super-continent called Pangea and was in the warm, wet equatorial region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Other large predators like rauisuchids and popsauroids, cousins of the ancient crocodiles, roamed much of the southern Hemisphere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They would have hunted alongside many of the early theropod dinosaurs that began to emerge at the same time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>However, the dinosaurs did not come to dominate until 135 million years later when many of these large crocodylomorphs died out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The smaller ancestors of modern crocodiles, which looked more like modern day foxes but without fur, managed to survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dr Zanno said: 'The discovery of Carnufex, one of the world's earliest and largest crocodylomorphs, adds new information to the push and pull of top terrestrial predators across Pangea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'These animals hunted alongside the earliest theropod dinosaurs, creating a predator pile-up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'Theropods were ready understudies for vacant top predator niches when large-bodied crocs and their relatives bowed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Susan Drymala, a palaeontologist at North Carolina State University who was also involved in the research, added: 'As theropod dinosaurs started to make it big, the ancestors of modern crocs initially took on a role similar to foxes or jackals, with small, sleek bodies and long limbs.</td></tr>
