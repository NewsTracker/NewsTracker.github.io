<h3>Prosecutor tracks Baltimore police arrest of Freddie Gray</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - Six Baltimore police officers were charged on Friday in the arrest and death in April of a 25-year-old black man, Freddie Gray, the latest flashpoint in police use of lethal force and race relations in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Baltimore police union that represents the officers said the six were only doing their jobs and were not responsible for Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>- Gray runs and the officers follow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When he is reached a short distance away, Gray surrenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police handcuff him and place him face down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gray tells the officers he cannot breathe in the position and requests an inhaler but is denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>- Miller and Nero move Gray into a seated position, search him and find a folding knife in his pants pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The knife, which is not a switchblade and is legal in Maryland, is removed and placed on the sidewalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gray is arrested without probable cause, according to Mosby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>- When Gray is set on his stomach for a second time, he begins to flail and scream.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Miller restrains him in a "leg brace" while Nero holds him down until a police wagon driven by Officer Caesar Goodson arrives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>- Rice, Nero and Miller load Gray into the wagon but do not secure him with a seatbelt despite the Baltimore Police Department's general order to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>- At some point, Rice tells Goodson to pull over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rice, Nero and Miller remove Gray from the wagon, place flex cuffs on his wrists, shackles on his ankles and fill out paperwork.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Gray is loaded on board again head first, face down on the wagon floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He is not secured with a seatbelt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Rice tells Goodson to drive to the central booking and intake facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>- En route to the police station, Goodson parks the vehicle again to check on Gray but does not seek medical assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Again, he drives off without fastening Gray in a seatbelt, according to Mosby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>- Several blocks later, Goodson radios that he needs to check on the status of his prisoner and requests additional help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Goodson stops for a third time and Officer William Porter meets him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Both officers check on Gray, who indicates he cannot breathe and requests medical help at least twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Porter moves Gray from the floor of the wagon to its bench area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>- While the officers discuss transporting Gray for medical attention, a call comes in requesting additional police support in arresting and transporting another person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Goodson drives off to lend his assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Gray, still unsecured, is inside the vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>No medical assistance is called for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>- At the site of the new arrest, Goodson and Porter again check on Gray's condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sergeant Alicia White, who is told to investigate two citizen complaints about Gray's arrest, also checks on Gray and attempts to speak to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"When he did not respond, she did nothing further despite the fact that she was advised that he needed a medic," Mosby said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>- After loading an additional prisoner into the wagon with Gray, still unsecured, Goodson arrives at the police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The second arrestee is taken inside before Gray is attended to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>- White and two additional officers attempt to remove Gray from the wagon, but Gray is no longer breathing, Mosby said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>- A medic is finally called and determines Gray is in cardiac arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Gray is taken to University of Maryland Medical Center trauma center, where he undergoes surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He succumbs to injuries on April 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Gray suffered a severe and critical neck injury as result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside of the (police) wagon," Mosby said.</td></tr>
