<h3>Last of Islamic State’s ‘Britani Brigade’ believed dead</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The last of a group of young men who travelled from Portsmouth to fight with Islamic State has died, it has been claimed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Assad Uzzaman, 25, was one of five men who styled themselves the Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys and travelled to Syria to fight as jihadis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The group were spotted on camera walking through Gatwick airport in October 2013 as they headed for the war-torn country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Of the group, four are now dead and a fifth, Mashudur Choudhury, is serving a prison term in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A sixth man, Ifthekar Jaman, was one of the first Britons to join Isis and encouraged others to fight with him in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He was killed in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Uzzaman, Jaman's cousin, is thought to be the 50th Briton killed while fighting in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His death was reported by Shiraz Maher, a senior research fellow at the international centre for the study of radicalisation (ICSR) at King's College in London, which monitors social media accounts of alleged jihadis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said: "The last of the Portsmouth cluster of fighters with Islamic State, Assad Uzzaman (Abu Abdullah) has died."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Maher said the exact nationality of one of those on the ICSR's database was unclear, so the figure of 50 Britons was uncertain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Uzzaman travelled to Syria almost two years ago with four others from Portsmouth - Choudhury, 31, Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 19, Mamunur Mohammed Roshid, 24, and Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jaman told the BBC's Newsnight just weeks before his death that he was engaged in jihad, or holy war, to help set up a state based on Islamic religious law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He told the BBC he posed no threat to the UK and had no plans to return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rahman is thought to have died in July last year while Roshid was killed in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hassan also died in October, fighting in Kobani, Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Choudhury, a father of two, was jailed for four years last December for travelling to Syria to attend a terrorist training camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>During his trial the jury heard he used Skype to send messages to Jaman and that, in a series of text messages Choudhury exchanged with his wife, she told him: "Go die in battlefield. Go die, I really mean it just go. I'll be relieved. At last. At last."</td></tr>
