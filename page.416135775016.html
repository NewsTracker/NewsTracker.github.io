<h3>Kid who won ESPN bracket contest gives Xbox to Make-A-Wish</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ESPN was stingy, but the kid stiffed by the "Worldwide Sports Leader" certainly isn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sam Holtz, 12, who was not allowed to claim ESPN's top prize despite completing a near-perfect bracket in the massive annual contest, is donating an Xbox to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I feel really good about doing it," he told the Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I'm really hoping that another kid just like me is going to be happy when they get it and happy when they start playing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Illinois sixth grader finished in a tie for first for accurately predicting the NCAA men's basketball tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But he didn't walk away with the grand $20,000 prize and trip to the Maui Invitational basketball tournament because he wasn't 18, the maximum age to qualify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Best Buy chipped in to ease the pain, giving Sam a $1,000 gift card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Instead of holding a grudge, the Hawthorn Woods boy used the money to buy one console for himself and another to give to the nonprofit which helps children with life-threatening diseases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sam was inspired by his older cousin, a cancer patient who was able to go to Disneyland because of Make-A-Wish - as well as his grandparents, who were volunteers with the foundation for several years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I decided to repay Make-A-Wish," Sam said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"When I first got the Xbox, I got really excited, and I decided why not make another kid feel just as excited."</td></tr>
