<h3>Jury resumes death penalty deliberations for Colorado theater shooter James Holmes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CENTENNIAL, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>? The jury in the Colorado theater shooting trial resumed deliberating Monday whether to keep the death penalty on the table for gunman James Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jurors deliberated for less than an hour Thursday before taking a scheduled day off Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jurors must decide whether there are any reasons, such as Holmes' mental illness and his trouble-free youth, that mean he should be sentenced to life in prison without parole instead of to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If jurors unanimously agree that such factors outweigh the heinousness of the July 2012 attack that killed 12 people and injured 70 others, Holmes would be sentenced to a life term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The same jury rejected Holmes' insanity defense and convicted him of 165 counts of murder, attempted murder and weapons charges last month.</td></tr>
