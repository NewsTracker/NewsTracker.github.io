<h3>Video of Chinese student who was carjacked by Boston marathon bombers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dun Meng, a Chinese engineering student at Northeastern University, was carjacked and driven around at gunpoint by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev three days after the brothers detonated homemade bombs at the marathon, killing three people and injuring 264.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He took the stand at 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death penalty trial on Thursday in Boston to testify about his horrifying ordeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The court watched surveillance footage of the minutes after Meng made a split-second decision to flee from the terrorists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He is seen running for his life from his SUV, across a gas station forecourt and a road into another nearby gas station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Once he gets inside, Meng drops to his knees and with great agitation tries to make the bewildered clerk understand what has happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He tries to hold the door shut and keeps glancing over his shoulder as he makes a prayer gesture, begging the man to call the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He can then be seen crawling behind the counter and into a cleaning closet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The store clerk called the police, but appeared to want to get rid of Meng.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He can be heard on the audiotape telling the dispatcher that a man came into the store and won't leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The dispatcher then asks to speak to Meng, telling him to take several deep breaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As the police officers come into the gas station, surveillance tape shows Meng coming out with his hands up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Dun Meng testified on Thursday that he had gone for a drive to relax after a long day at work on April 18 and had pulled over to check his phone 'because texting and driving is dangerous' - when Tamerlan tapped on his window, stepped into his car and pulled a gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'He pulled the magazine out of the gun to show me there's bullets in the gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He told me, 'You know, I'm serious, so don't be stupid,'' Meng, who works at a tech company that develops cell phone apps for ordering food, said in federal court in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'After that, he asked me, 'Do you know the Boston Marathon explosion?' I said, 'Yes, I know.' He asked, 'Do you know who did it?' I said, 'No, I don't.' He said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Meng, who testified on the sixth day of trial, said Tamerlan asked him if his car, a Mercedes-Benz SUV, had GPS and could get them to New York - while Dzhokhar was concerned about connecting his iPhone to play music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The student was ordered to drive under Tsarnaev's directions and the two had a conversation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tsarnaev asked Meng where he was from and what his name was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Meng then responded that Chinese people like Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He testified that Tsarnaev asked him a series of questions as he drove including what he did in the U.S., who he lived with and if anyone cared about him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meng responded by telling him that no one was waiting for him and he could relax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , wearing a gray hoodie, returns to dump snacks he has picked out at a gas station in Cambridge on April 18, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>His brother Tamerlan, in the beige cap, has just allowed their hostage to escape and the brothers were making a move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The student handed over the PIN to his bank account and his card as they drove around Watertown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The victim said he thought it was a test to see if he would remember his face so he agreed with the bomber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Meng told the court that the car which had initially pulled up behind him appears to have followed and pulls up behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The brothers began transferring belongings from the car to the SUV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He was told to get in the passenger seat while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev gets in the back seat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Meng identified the bomber sitting in the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Tamerlan then drives to an ATM which Dzhokhar goes inside with Meng's bankcard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>They are speaking in a language he doesn't understand, Meng told the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The student said that he decides his only chance to get away is when the brothers are separated 'because they both had guns'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Tamerlan then asks how far they can go on the 1/4 tank of gas in the SUV before trying to find out if there was GPS in the car which could get them to New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Tamerlan then puts on the radio and later music from a CD which he describes as 'weird, religious... it made me feel nervous'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Then Meng's roommate called his cellphone and the bluetooth connection caused it to ring around the entire car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Tamerlan looks at the message and Meng truthfully tells him what it says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The bomber then tried to look up an English to Mandarin dictionary on the phone to respond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>As the bomber attempts to respond to the text message, Meng's second roommate calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The student testified that Tamerlan now appeared nervous, put the gun to his head and ordered him to answer the call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>'If you say any single word in Chinese, I will kill you right now,' Meng was told by the bomber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He answered the phone to his friend who was immediately surprised that Meng was speaking in English and not Mandarin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>He made an excuse and hung up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The prosecution then asked if Meng had ever seen Tamerlan point the gun at his brother or threaten him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Meng said he had not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Tamerlan pulled up the Mercedes at a Shell gas station in Cambridge and Dzhokhar leaves with cash to pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>As Meng gave his testimony, Tsarnaev refused to look at him, staring down at the table as he has done throughout the trial so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The student said at this point, he was aware his chances to escape were becoming slim and that now may be the best opportunity he will have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Dzhokhar is inside the gas station and Tamerlan is playing with a GPS device which appeared to have come from the other car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>'I count in my mind 1,2,3, 4,' Meng testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The student then said he unbuckled his seat belt and pushed the car door open as he could feel Tamerlan grabbing at him with his left hand and cursing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Meng ran for his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Earlier on Thursday, the jury viewed autopsy photos of Sean Collier, a university police officer who prosecutors contend the brothers shot dead shortly before the carjacking, in an unsuccessful effort to steal his gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>He also was shot twice and once grazed in his hand, Renee Robinson, a doctor with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Boston testified at U.S. District Court in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>'Collier inhaled his own blood' as he died, Robinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Three bullets, one of them between the eyes, were fired into Collier's brain at close range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>The first bullet entered Collier's head, traveled down his neck and became lodged there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>A second bullet entered his left cheek went through the cheekbone and becomes lodged in Collier's brain, Dr Robinson told the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>She added: 'He's essentially dead right away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>U.S. District Judge George O'Toole ordered autopsy photos of Collier, 27, to be shown only to the jury out of respect for his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Some jurors could be seen tearing up as they viewed the photos of Collier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>The court also viewed pictures of blood pooled in his squad car's cup holders and on its floor.If convicted of carrying out the bombing and of killing Collier, Tsarnaev could be sentenced to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Defense attorneys opened the trial last week by admitting that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev committed the crimes for which he is accused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>They are seeking to spare him the death penalty by demonstrating that he was following the lead of his older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan, who died after a gunfight with police following Collier's shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Federal prosecutors contend that the younger Tsarnaev, who emigrated with his family from Chechnya a decade before the attack, was driven by an extremist view of Islam and a desire to strike back at the United States for military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Collier's death marked the start of a chaotic 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The brothers carjacked a man and hurled explosives at police during a shootout that ended when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev roared off in a car, running over and killing his brother before disappearing into a drydocked boat in the Boston suburb of Watertown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Police found him the next evening, after a day-long lockdown of the Boston area when hundreds of thousands of people hid in their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, and graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, as well as 8-year-old Martin Richard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Officer Collier, 27, was gunned down by the Boston bombers as the terrorists tried to flee on April 18, 2013.</td></tr>
