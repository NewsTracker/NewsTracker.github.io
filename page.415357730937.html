<h3>Federal judge dismisses lawsuit challenging Ten Commandments monument at Oklahoma Capitol</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The lawsuit filed by a New Jersey-based nonprofit group, American Atheists Inc., and two of its members in January 2014 alleged the monument violated the First Amendment's prohibition of government sanctioning of a specific religion, as well as other constitutional rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. District Judge Robin Cauthron ruled that the group lacked legal standing to file the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An attorney for the group, Eric O. Husby of Tampa, Florida, said he disagrees with the ruling but that no decision has been made to appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Cauthron's decision was hailed by Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, whose office defended the monument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The historical relevance of the Ten Commandments and the role it played in the founding of our nation cannot be disputed," Pruitt said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's the second time that Pruitt's office has successfully defended the monument against constitutional challenges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In September, Oklahoma County District Judge Thomas Prince ruled that the monument does not violate the state constitution and can remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The ruling has been appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The original 6-foot-tall granite monument was erected in 2012 after a bill authorizing it was passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That monument was destroyed in October when a car drove across the Capitol lawn and crashed into it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A replica was installed in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Since the monument's placement on the Capitol grounds, other groups have asked to erect their own monuments, including a satanic group, a Hindu leader in Nevada, an animal rights group and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.</td></tr>
