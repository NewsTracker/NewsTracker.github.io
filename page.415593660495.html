<h3>Another wincer for Wenner: US Weekly retracts Jenner story</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the latest black eye, Us Weekly on Thursday retracted a story by a freelance writer who claimed to have scored an exclusive interview with Kendall Jenner talking about her father's transition to womanhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jenner angrily denied that the interview took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Shame on US Weekly for making up quotes," Jenner tweeted on Wednesday shortly after the story was posted on the Us Weekly website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I NEVER said those things. I never spoke to them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Us Weekly said it had "concerns" about the veracity of the story - which was titled "Kendall Jenner Breaks Silence on Bruce Jenner's Transition: 'I Will Always Love My Dad.'" It removed the story from its site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It never made the print edition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a statement on Thursday, Us Weekly said, "The interview was allegedly conducted by an independent freelance journalist at the Saturday, March 14, taping of Comedy Central's roast of Justin Bieber in Los Angeles. When Ms. Jenner denied, via Twitter, that the interview took place, Us Weekly immediately reached out to the freelance reporter. He stood by the interview, and continues to maintain that the quotes are accurate. However, after attempting to reconfirm his account, editors of Us have concerns about the veracity of this interview and the circumstances under which it was obtained. We would like to retract the story entirely and have removed it from our website. We sincerely apologize to Ms. Jenner and her family."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Shame on US Weekly for making up quotes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>I NEVER said those things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>I never spoke to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In another unfortunate episode, an explosive Nov. 19, 2014, story in Rolling Stone alleged a gang rape of a female student, "Jackie," at a fraternity at the University of Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Wenner Media backed away from the RS story, which was based on interviews of Jackie, after enduring several weeks of media scrutiny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced," stated an apology written several weeks after the story hit newsstands by RS managing editor Will Dana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wenner turned down the resignations offered by Dana and another editor on the project, Sean Woods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After several more weeks of questions, Wenner told the staff in late December that he had asked Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and Sheila Coronel, dean of academics, to investigate the process that allowed the story to make it into print.</td></tr>

<h3>UN ignored Ebola warnings and RESISTED declaring public emergency, secret emails reveal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The UN health agency avoided declaring the killer disease as a public health emergency for diplomatic reasons despite warnings from senior staff, an investigation has found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Secret documents obtained by AP show WHO's top bosses were informed of how dire the situation was despite public claims that they had little information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But they held off on declaring an emergency because it could have angered the countries involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Declaring an emergency was "a last resort," Dr Sylvie Briand, who runs WHO's pandemic and epidemic diseases department, said in a June email to a colleague who suggested the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It may be more efficient to use other diplomatic means for now," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Five days after Briand's email, WHO director Dr Margaret Chan was sent a memo that warned cases might soon appear in Mali, Ivory Coast and Guinea Bissau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But it went on to say that declaring an international emergency or even convening a committee to discuss it "could be seen as a hostile act".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Critics and former WHO staff have dismissed the reasoning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That's like saying you don't want to call the fire department because you're afraid the trucks will create a disturbance," said infectious diseases expert Michael Osterholm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The signs this was no ordinary outbreak were there from the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Many were recorded in a memo sent to WHO's Africa director on March 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>En Ebola expert with WHO's Africa office wrote a desperate email to Geneva with disturbing news that many staffers at a leading hospital in Guinea had been exposed to the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"What we see is the tip of an iceberg," Jean-Bosco Ndihokubwayo wrote in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"WE NEED SUPPORT."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Ebola outbreak erupted at a difficult time for the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>WHO was also struggling to contain polio outbreaks - which it had declared an international emergency in May - and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At a June 2 meeting, one senior scientist warned the agency was "overwhelmed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The emergency was eventually declared on August 8, by which point nearly 1,000 people had already died from Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The declaration triggered a global deployment to contain the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama ordered up to 3,000 troops to West Africa and promised to build more than a dozen 100-bed field hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Britain and France also pledged to build Ebola clinics, while China sent a 59-person lab team and Cuba sent more than 400 health workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Former WHO scientist Dr. Matthieu Kamway says it's clear the alarm should have been sounded sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"People died because things were not done," he said.</td></tr>
