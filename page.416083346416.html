<h3>Putin meets with Greece's Tsipras</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOSCOW, April 8 (UPI) -- Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras met with Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday on a trip some in Europe perceive as an attempt to gain Russian financial help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek officials said payment of the loan could mean the Greek government will be unable to pay pensions and public sector wages next week, the New York Yimes said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Although Greek officials insisted Tsipras' visit to Moscow was not in search of financial assistance, it highlights suggestions of a breakdown in European solidarity against Russia, and of the success of sanctions put in place to protest Russian involvement in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In meeting with Tsipras, Putin noted trade between Greece and Russia doubled from 2009 to 2013 but fell 40 percent in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We need to discuss the issues of recovery of the trade rate of growth. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This is why we have to recover the rate of growth," Putin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The EU sees the visit as an effort by Greece to find new allies as it seeks another bailout of about 240 billion Euros ($260 billion) to avert bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By reinforcing ties with Moscow, Tsipras could be checking to see if Russia might be a future ally and benefactor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>European leaders are looking at the meeting with interest, but distance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande have each predicted nothing of substance will come of the meetings between Putin and Tsipras, and at a press conference Tuesday with Hollande in Berlin, Merkel noted, "We were also in Moscow and we're still members of the European Union and stand unified," a reference to a visit by Merkel and Hollande in February.</td></tr>
