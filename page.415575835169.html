<h3>Barcelona aims for decisive blow against Real Madrid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Barcelona is on a run of 17 wins in its last 18 games and leads the league by one point, while Madrid is a shadow of the side that ended 2014 on a Spanish record 22-match winning streak that included a 3-1 win over the Catalan club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Regardless of the teams' contrasting form, one constant will remain: Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will again vie to leave their mark on one of the most hotly contested rivalries in soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We face the match with a lot of respect," Messi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Madrid never plays poorly and when they appear to be struggling, they are even more dangerous. They have incredibly talented players, and we have to respect then more than ever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Barcelona appeared to be on the brink of a breakdown following a loss at Real Sociedad in early January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That was followed by a chaotic week that included the firing of its sport director and president Josep Bartomeu calling for early elections in the offseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The team has responded in incredible fashion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Barcelona has reached the final of the Copa del Rey, the quarterfinals of the Champions League, and has passed Madrid in the league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Madrid has gone the other way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Injuries and tougher competition have transformed the once invincible European champions into a vulnerable side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The team has nine wins, two draws and five losses since the winter break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Madrid will arrive at Camp Nou the better rested team after not having played since last Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Barcelona remains on a high after a second convincing victory over Manchester City on Wednesday, when it eased into the Champions League quarterfinals for a record eighth straight season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We are strengthened by the win (over City)," Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We have the important advantage of playing at home, but in many cases that isn't decisive. To talk about being favorites is risky and pretentious."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There is no secret to Barcelona's success: Messi is back to playing at a level reminiscent of his best days under former coach Pep Guardiola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Luis Enrique has moved Messi back to his original position on the right side of Barcelona's attack, and Messi is flourishing both as a scorer and in his newfound role as the team's best passer and playmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Not surprisingly, Madrid's troubles coincide with a dip in form from Ronaldo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ronaldo once held a big lead over Messi in goals scored in the league, 23-13 through 15 matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Messi has since gone on a scoring streak with 19 goals in the last 12 games, while Ronaldo has notched five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Messi now leads Ronaldo 32-30 in the league and 43-41 overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The game may well be decided in the midfield, where Madrid has finally managed to match Barcelona by bringing in strong passers like Toni Kroos and Francisco "Isco" Alarcon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Madrid will be without James Rodriguez with a broken foot, while Javier Mascherano should seamlessly fill in for Barcelona in place of injured stopper Sergio Busquets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The question then for Luis Enrique is whether to play Jeremy Mathieu or Marca Bartra alongside Gerard Pique in defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>With all eyes on the clasico, third-place Valencia will try to gain ground on the top two when it visits Elche on Friday trailing Madrid by seven points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Defending champion Atletico Madrid is a point behind Valencia and hosts Getafe on Saturday, while Sevilla visits Villarreal in a meeting of the league's fifth- and sixth-place sides on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Manchester City's Yaya Toure, right, challenges Barcelona's Lionel Messi, left, during a Champions League round of 16 second leg, soccer match between FC Barcelona and Manchester City at Camp Nou stadium, in Barcelona, Spain, Wednesday, March 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo from Portugal reacts during a La Liga soccer match between Real Madrid and Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain, Sunday, March 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo from Portugal, fails as he jumps trying to kick the ball during a Spanish La Liga soccer match between Real Madrid and Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain, Sunday, March 15, 2015.</td></tr>
