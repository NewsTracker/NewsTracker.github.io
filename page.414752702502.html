<h3>Surrender or die: Ukrainians trapped in Debaltseve pocket as deadline looms</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Russian officials still deny having troops on the ground in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the encirclement of Debaltseve and the intensification of the battle immediately after President Vladimir Putin signed the peace agreement in Minsk has many people convinced that it is a Russian-led operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Like many Ukrainian soldiers, the 39-year-old artilleryman, who gave his name only as Djin, said he had no doubts that professional Russian forces were in the field in the area around Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>&#x201c;Ok, I haven&#x2019;t seen them, but I&#x2019;ve seen their professionalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You see how they work their mortars, it&#x2019;s one ranging shot then straight away, one two three four five,&#x201d; he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The seeds of this battle were sown in August, when a two-pronged Ukrainian offensive drove wedges deep into rebel lines in an effort to surround the separatist stronghold of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A massive Russian intervention halted and then reversed that advance, forcing Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine&#x2019;s president, to sue for a peace deal signed in Minsk on September 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The resulting ceasefire left Debaltseve at the tip of a Ukrainian salient jutting deep into separatist territory &#x2013; and cutting the main road between the rebels&#x2019; most important strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In January, the separatists launched a major offensive to retake the town, provoking panicked efforts to broker and end to the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It was one of the most hotly contested points at the Minsk talks on Wednesday night, with Mr Poroshenko reportedly spending a great deal of time arguing with Mr Putin over whether or not the town was surrounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For some, the battle is yet more confirmation of Russian deceit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>&#x201c;In Minsk, Putin said there was a pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There was no pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>So he gave the order to create one,&#x201d; said a civilian volunteer who delivers supplies to Ukrainian troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But some say the situation has been much more difficult for much longer than Kiev officially wants to admit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On Friday, a prominent Ukrainian commander, Semen Semenchenko, criticised official military spokesmen for pretending that the road was still open, saying his men had been forced to withdraw from a key hamlet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And the wounded in Artemivsk hospital had come from positions outside the pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>&#x201c;No one gets out of Debaltseve,&#x201d; said one soldier who declined to give his name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>&#x201c;You can carry on if you want to die,&#x201d; a Ukrainian soldier at a checkpoint on the road from Artemivsk to Debaltseve warned reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Vyacheslav Abroskin, the Kiev-loyalist regional police chief, wrote on Facebook: &#x201c;The rebels are destroying the town of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>There are non-stop artillery bombardments of residential areas and buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Natalia Karabuta, head of Debaltseve&#x2019;s health service, said shortly after fleeing the town that people were stranded by the bombardments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>&#x201c;The shelling doesn&#x2019;t stop, the longest pause is for 30 minutes,&#x201d; she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>&#x201c;People are hiding from the mortar fire in residential areas in the basements of the hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>&#x201c;The windows have been blown out but the building is still whole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The frost-covered road south-east of the Artemivsk, usually a bustling federal highway, is deserted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Now, only the occasional Ukrainian army vehicle, driving at high speed to escape shelling, disturbs what would in other circumstance be a tranquil winter scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Exactly what is going on down the road is almost impossible to tell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With few, if any, Ukrainian troops making it in or out of Debaltseve, soldiers and civilians there are left only with rumours and the near-constant artillery fire to tell them what is still going on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>For the doctors at the hospital, the proximity of the battle means overload.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>&#x201c;All the other hospitals have been shelled or closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>We&#x2019;re the first and the last, unfortunately,&#x201d; said a surgeon in hospital scrubs as he filled in notes on the hospital wing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It must shoulder not only the work of all other civilian hospitals, but is also the first port of call for military casualties on this section of the front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Doctors declined to give figures for those casualties, but it is clear the hospital is overloaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The beds are for the more serious casualties, while walking wounded take seats in the corridors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>&#x201c;Yesterday I took children to the morgue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>What kind of ceasefire do you really expect?&#x201d; said Sergei Supron, a volunteer with a civilian group that runs ambulances towards the front line to bring back wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mr Supron, a Kiev advertising man in civilian life, was referring to a rocket strike in Artemivsk that killed three people, including a seven-year-old, on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The attack, which peppered cluster bombs across gardens and driveways in a residential suburb, was another reminder that on this part of the front, the war is heating up, not cooling down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Yesterday, repair crews and police investigators carefully stepped around the bloodstains that marked where one of the victims died on Zagorodnaya Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Every other home on the street of bungalows and vegetable gardens has been damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>A bomblet that landed squarely in the driveway of number 41 Zagorodnaya Street peppered a green metal gate with shrapnel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>&#x201c;I was out when it happened,&#x201d; said Tania Magda, the 58-year-old owner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>&#x201c;All we want is peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>But how many attempts to have a ceasefire have we had already?</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Alexander Zakharchenko, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#x2019;s Republic, signed a decree ordering a ceasefire on Friday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>But he added in a press conference that the ceasefire would not apply to Debaltseve because he considered it to be inside separatist territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>And he added that any attempt by the Ukrainians to break out of or to relieve the pocket would be considered &#x201c;a violation of the Minsk agreement&#x201d;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>That effectively presents the Ukrainians trapped in the pocket with an ultimatum: surrender or die.</td></tr>

<h3>Investigators: Arson suspected in Houston Islamic center fire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ahsan Zahid, assistant imam at the institute, said some items on the grounds were also vandalized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the fire started at the back of the building and moved through the 3,000-square-foot building that was being used to store computers, monitors, lights and everything else they planned to use in the renovations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The fire was so destructive that it completely destroyed our building - everything that was in the building and even the roof is falling in," he said on a video posted to Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Council on American-Islamic Relations called for state and federal investigators to monitor the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Given the unprecedented level of anti-Muslim rhetoric in our society, it would only be prudent to investigate a possible bias motive for this apparent arson attack," Ruth Nasrullah, a spokeswoman for the organization, said.</td></tr>
