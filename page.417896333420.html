<h3>N. Korea says its wonder drug can cure Ebola, AIDS, MERS & SARS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Scientists around the world can apparently hang up their lab coats, because North Korea says it has found a cure for Ebola, AIDS, MERS, and SARS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The claim is a tough pill to swallow, however, and is likely to be met with a generous dose of skepticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For decades, researchers have devoted their careers to finding cures for the diseases, but it turns out Pyongyang has secretly had the solution for 19 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That's right - the country apparently first produced the disease-fighting drug in 1996, according to pro-North Korea website Minjok Tongshin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pyongyang has failed, however, to provide any proof to its lofty claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although the world's best scientists couldn't crack the code, it seems the cure wasn't actually all that complicated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A natural herb, some plant food, and a few elements were apparently all that were needed to solve a few of science's biggest puzzles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The injection drug Kumdang-2 was developed from ginseng grown from fertilizer mixed with rare-earth elements, according to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It even has "micro-quantities of gold and platinum" thrown in, the drug's website says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The drug is really convenient, because it's supposedly a cure-all for all four diseases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Malicious virus infections like SARS, Ebola and MERS are diseases that are related to immune systems, so they can be easily treated by Kumdang-2 injection drug, which is a strong immune reviver," KCNA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It also claims the drug can cure AIDS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the benefits of the drug don't stop there, it seems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Pyongyang boasted about the same drug during the deadly bird flu outbreaks of 2006 and 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, earlier this year, North Korea shut out foreign tourists for six months, exercising some of the world's strictest Ebola controls - even though the country apparently has the cure in their possession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>No cases of the disease were ever actually reported in the country, and the bans were lifted earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Meanwhile, according to the World Health Organization, North Korea is struggling to combat diseases such as tuberculosis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Respiratory infections are among the country's leading causes of death, the UN agency says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Pyongyang's claim comes as rival South Korea fights a MERS outbreak that has so far killed two dozen people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>More than 160 have fallen ill from the disease, for which there is no vaccine.</td></tr>
