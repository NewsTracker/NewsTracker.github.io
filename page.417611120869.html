<h3>Women's miniskirt protest fails to catch on in Tunisia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TUNIS, Tunisia- Only a handful of women have answered a call by a Tunisian rights' group to protest the repression of women in the Muslim world by demonstrating in miniskirts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>About a dozen mini-skirted women took part Saturday afternoon in the protest organized by Tunisia's League for the Defense of Secularism and Freedom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lilia Kammoun, a teacher at the protest, said Tunisia is regressing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She said "it's sad that we're moving backward. My mother used to wear a miniskirt. I used to wear a miniskirt. And today, my daughter is hesitating to wear one. That's unfortunate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Counter-demonstrators waved signs with slogans like "This is shameful, you're thinking with your sexual organs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Protest organizers blamed the low turnout on women's fears of their families and of Islamic extremists.</td></tr>
