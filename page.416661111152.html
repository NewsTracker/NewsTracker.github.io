<h3>CDC cautions against unprotected sex with Ebola survivors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. health officials are now recommending people avoid contact with the semen of Ebola survivors after a woman in Liberia contracted Ebola through sexual intercourse with a survivor of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a report issued on Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a review of the 44-year-old woman's case now suggests that the Ebola virus persists longer in semen that previously thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CDC said it is conducting further studies to see how long the virus can remain viable in body fluids of male and female survivors and the likelihood of sexual transmission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Until more information is known, CDC recommends that if male survivors choose to have sex - oral, vaginal, or anal - they should use a condom every time.</td></tr>
