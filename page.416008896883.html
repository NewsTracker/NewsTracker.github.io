<h3>AP source: MLB's Manfred plans to give DC '18 All-Star Game (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The person spoke Sunday to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the site of the game ahead of the official announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Washington would be the fourth consecutive National League team to host baseball's All-Star Game, following the Cincinnati Reds this year, the San Diego Padres in 2016 and the Miami Marlins in 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When Miami's turn to have the game was announced in February, MLB said leagues will continue to alternate who bats last, no matter what city stages the All-Star game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>So the American League will bat last in the 2016 game at San Diego and in the 2018 game at Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Manfred is scheduled to be at Nationals Park on Monday, when defending NL East champion Washington begins its season against the New York Mets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The nation's capital has hosted the All-Star Game four times previously - in 1937, 1956, 1962 and 1969.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That most recent one was at RFK Stadium, the first ballpark used by the Nationals when they left Montreal and arrived in Washington in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With Nationals Park, which cost more than $600 million and opened in 2008, getting its first All-Star Game, three existing stadiums have yet to be assigned one by MLB: the homes of the New York Yankees, Tampa Bay Rays and Philadelphia Phillies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Atlanta Braves are scheduled to move into a new ballpark in two years.</td></tr>
