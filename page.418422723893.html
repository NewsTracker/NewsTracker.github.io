<h3>Greece's Tsipras to sell austerity deal to reluctant party</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A man holds a tag queue position as he waits next to others pensioners outside the main gate of the national bank of Greece to withdraw a maximum of 120 euros ($134) in central Athens, Friday, July 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will seek backing for a harsh new austerity package from his party Friday to keep his country in the euro - less than a week after urging Greeks to reject milder cuts in a referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras sought his left-wing party's backing on Friday for a new budget austerity package that is harsher than what he urged Greeks to reject in a vote just last week, but would provide the country will longer-term financial support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Government ministers signed off on the sweeping new measures, which include pension cuts and tax increases that are likely to inflict further pain on a people that have just emerged from a six-year economic depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If approved, Greece would in return get a three-year package of loans worth nearly $60 billion as well as some form of debt relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The package would be far larger than the 7.2 billion euros creditors had been offering to Greece during the previous five months of fruitless negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greece's latest proposal was sent to rescue creditors who will meet this weekend to decide whether to approve them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The new package of loans would be Greece's third bailout program since it lost access to financing from bond markets in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In an unusual move, Tsipras is first seeking authorization from parliament to negotiate with the creditors based on the proposal in a vote Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He is essentially asking his Syriza party to sign off on measures that to many feel like a U-turn since more than 60 percent of voters opposed more austerity in last Sunday's referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tsipras convened his party's lawmakers for closed-door discussions Friday morning before the parliamentary debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The proposal was being debated at committee level Friday afternoon, and it was unclear when the full assembly debate would start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Votes are usually held at midnight, but they can go later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The coalition government has 162 seats in the 300-member parliament and pledged backing on a deal from a large section of opposition lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But failure to deliver votes from his own government could topple Tsipras' coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The proposals are to be discussed by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday, ahead of a summit of the European Union's 28 leaders Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Though German officials would not be drawn on the merits of the Greek proposals, French President Francois Hollande said they are "serious and credible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>France's Socialist government has been among Greece's few allies in the eurozone during the past months of tough negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs eurozone finance ministers' meetings, said the proposals were "extensive" but would not say whether he considered them sufficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Friday, Dijsselbloem will hold a conference call with the leaders of other key creditors, the EU's executive Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They are then expected to send their assessment of the proposal to the eurozone finance ministers later Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>As the government inched closer to a deal to ensure Greece doesn't crash out of Europe's joint currency, some Greeks were furious at the deep spending cuts in the proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"If this is Europe, then we don't want this Europe," said Aristidis Dimoupulos, a marketing professor in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"If this is the eurozone, we don't care if we go out or in. If in this life we'll be slaves, it's better to be dead."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I don't know. The chances are fifty-fifty" for a deal, said Athens resident Omiros Fotiadis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Meanwhile, in Greece, banks remained shut since the start of last week and cash withdrawals were restricted to 60 euros ($67) per day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Although credit and debit cards work freely within the country, many businesses are refusing to accept them and insisting on cash-only payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>All money transfers abroad, including bill payments, require special permission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Alternate Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas said the banks would be gradually restored to operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>They are currently due to remain closed through Monday, at which time he said a new order would be issued expanding what transactions can be carried out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Experts say it is unlikely that, even in the event of a deal, the limits on cash withdrawals and transfers will be lifted completely for some time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Rallies backing and opposing the government were planned in central Athens for Friday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Syriza had resisted a new loans-for-austerity deal, arguing the country is too weak to endure it, with a quarter of the labor force out of work and a growing number living in poverty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But it was forced to resume talks with the creditors as the Greek banks faced the prospect of collapse within days if the country did not receive a new rescue package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Athens finally issued its proposals late Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In return for the new package, the government said it would seek debt relief - a notion gaining ground internationally despite reluctance in Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"The realistic proposal from Greece will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Only then will we have a win-win situation," European Council President Donald Tusk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>On Thursday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also said the possibility of some kind of debt relief would be discussed over coming days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>But in a note of caution, he added: "The room for maneuver through debt re-profiling or restructuring is very small."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Anna Psaroudakis in Athens, Angela Charlton in Paris and Mike Corder in the The Hague, Netherlands, contributed to this report.</td></tr>
