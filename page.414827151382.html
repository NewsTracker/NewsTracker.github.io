<h3>Russia shelling Ukraine across the countries&#8217; shared border, according to forensic analysis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Satellite images on Google Earth prove that Russia has been shelling Ukraine across the countries' shared border, according to a new forensic analysis of 1353 artillery craters in Eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There is "compelling evidence that artillery attacks on Ukrainian territory and against Ukrainian armed forces originated from the territory of Russia" in July and August last year, concludes the Bellingcat report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ukrainian soldiers play football on the road leading to the embattled town of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Ukrainian forces say they have been shelled regularly by Russian troops in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bellingcat is an international group of volunteers, both experts and amateurs informally led by Briton Eliot Higgins, who co-ordinate their 'crowdsourced' work on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Since July last year Ukraine has accused Russia of directly attacking its territory - though the claims were officially denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Bellingcat used new satellite imagery from Google showing the Ukraine-Russia border between mid-July to the end of August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They found artillery impact craters and used their distinctive 'arrow' shape to determine the trajectory of the original fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A still of craters inside the Ukraine from the Bellingcat report, which shows Russia fired shells from its territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They then tracked back along that line, and found burn marks (from the rocket launch exhaust) and tyre tracks at likely firing positions - inside Russian territory and aimed at Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At one location they found 813 craters indicating six separate attacks from five different directions, all but one of which was "clearly within the territory of Russia," the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Bellingcat also used geolocation techniques on amateur YouTube video of rocket volleys, to show they were being fired from Russia at Ukraine positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>These positions matched those calculated from the crater analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Video analysis from the Bellingcat report, which concludes that there is 'compelling evidence that artillery attacks on Ukrainian territory and against Ukrainian armed forces originated from the territory of Russia' in July and August last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The analysis matches contemporary reports in Ukraine media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In a report on Ukrainian Hromadske TV in August last year, a young Ukraine soldier named 'Mykyta' said he had sheltered in a trench near the Russian border for hours as Russian artillery rained down on him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"When these Grads [rockets] are firing and you are in your trench, all you can do is hope that you will survive, and pray. Personally, I sometimes recited a prayer something like 30 times," he said in the interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The Russians showered us with artillery shells, using Grad systems that were stationed on their territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A still from the Bellingcat report shows launch positions of rockets fired from Russia at Ukraine forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There was a time when artillery shells flew at us from four different directions. The toughest day was when the shelling lasted for 5 or 6 hours, with intervals between rounds of artillery fire lasting only 30-40 seconds, maybe some up to 1 minute, but not longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Before this shelling would start, a Russian scout plane flew over our heads, correcting the Russian artillery, giving directions, where exactly to fire."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Russia has repeatedly denied any military involvement in Ukraine, describing the fighting in the country's Donbas region as a civil war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>An independent military forensics expert told The Guardian that crater analysis like this from satellite photography was scientifically unproven, but the images of firing positions on the Russian side of the border were "compelling".</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In August 2014 Oana Lungescu, a spokeswoman for NATO, told the New York Times "Russian artillery support - both cross-border and from within Ukraine - is being employed against the Ukrainian armed forces."</td></tr>
