<h3>Israeli PM regrets offending Arab-Israelis during poll</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Netanyahu drew accusations of racism in Israel when he warned that "the Arabs are voting in droves," just a few hours before polling stations were to close across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Right wing rule is in danger. Arab voters are going to the polls in droves. Left wing organisations are bringing them in buses," Netanyahu said in a video statement posted on his Facebook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu, whose Likud Party won re-election in the vote, met with members of the Arab community in Jerusalem on Monday and accepted that his comments offended members of the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said he knew his "comments last week offended some Israeli citizens and offended members of the Israeli-Arab community," before adding, "this was never my intent. I regret this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The White House issued a strong rebuke of his comments, with Press Secretary Josh Earnest saying the US was "deeply concerned about rhetoric that seeks to marginalise Arab-Israeli citizens".</td></tr>
