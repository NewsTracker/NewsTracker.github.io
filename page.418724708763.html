<h3>Apple Inc shares sink as iPhone shipments, revenue forecast miss estimates</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple Inc.'s iPhone shipments for the fiscal third quarter and the company's revenue forecast for the current period missed analysts' projections, raising questions over whether demand for the device has peaked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shares fell as much as 8.8 per cent in extended trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple sold 47.5 million iPhones, a 35 per cent gain, in the period that ended in June, the company said in a statement Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Analysts had anticipated 48.8 million shipments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company forecast revenue of US$49 billion to US$51 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in September, short of the average estimate for US$51.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Any indication of slowing demand for iPhones could spark concern that Apple is going to have a hard time selling more smartphones in the final months of the year, after the September debut of the latest version fueled record profits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A new model is expected to be released later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's going to be running up against really hard comparisons," said Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. "A lot of people jumped to the larger-screened iPhones, now that we've gotten to the point where the innovation in the next release is not going to be as massive as we had last year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple shares fell as much as 8.8 per cent in extended trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The stock declined 1 per cent to US$130.75 at the close in New York, leaving it up 18 per cent this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Net income in the fiscal third quarter, which ended in June, was US$10.7 billion, or US$1.85 a share, while revenue rose 33 per cent to US$49.6 billion, the Cupertino, California-based company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Analysts on average had forecast third-quarter profit of US$1.81 a share on sales of US$49.4 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The gross margin was 39.7 per cent, topping the company's outlook for 38.5 per cent to 39.5 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Total revenue from greater China more than doubled to US$13.2 billion, even as the Chinese economy weakened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Apple was less forthcoming about the watch, which some analysts and investors see as an important indicator of the company's ability to produce successful new products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Top executives stood by their decision not to release sales figures for the company's sleek new smartwatch, saying the information could be used by competitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Apple included the results for the smartwatch in a broad category called "Other," along with items such as Beats headphones and iPod sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In one tantalizing clue, Apple reported $2.6 billion in revenue from the segment that includes the watch and several other products, or about $952 million more than the previous quarter, when the watch had not yet gone on sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That's significantly less than the $1.8 billion in watch sales that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We looked back at similar periods for iPhone and iPad when they were originally launched, and we've actually sold more Apple Watches than we sold iPhone and iPad at the time," Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We feel very good about the start and what we feel particularly happy about is, frankly, the customer response, the feedback we're getting."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While not expected to be an important revenue source now, the watch has symbolic importance as the first new product category that Apple has launched since the 2011 death of founder and iconic CEO Steve Jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"When you look at the next big wave of innovation, in coming years, it's not going to come from smartphones," said analyst Angelo Zino of S&P Capital Markets, who said phones are already becoming "commodity" items, even with Apple dominating the high end of that market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"So a lot of people want to see if Apple can roll out a new product that's very successful and innovative."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>IPad sales continued to suffer, with tablet shipments falling 18 per cent to 10.9 million, marking the sixth straight quarter of declines and matching analysts' average estimate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Apple is working on a new larger-screened version of the iPad that could appeal to corporate customers looking to use the device as a replacement for a laptop computer, people familiar with the plans have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mac shipments climbed 8.7 per cent to 4.8 million, matching projections.</td></tr>
