<h3>Commentary: 5 mistakes Hillary Clinton made in her Las Vegas press conference on emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton held a press availability in Las Vegas Tuesday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It did not go well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton got into an extended back and forth with Fox News Channel's Ed Henry over the private email server she exclusively used during her time as Secretary of State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Oomph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton, who seems to have a blind spot as to why the e-mail server story is such a big deal, made a bunch of mistakes in that brief interaction with the media that you would assume someone of her deep experience would have been able to avoid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Here's a list of what she did wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She sounds like a lawyer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Her first response is, as it was when she first addressed the existence of the private server back in March, to insist that she is in no legal jeopardy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"What I did was legally permitted, number one, first and foremost, okay?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clinton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sure. No neutral observer has suggested that there is any illegality in what Clinton did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But there's a big difference between how this story plays in a court of law and how it plays in the court of public opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Clinton seems not to grasp that simply because she is not being charged with anything doesn't mean that this whole set-up doesn't look bad and raise doubts about her among voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Talking in legal terms does not help Clinton's political case on this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She casts the whole thing as normal and everyday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I don't doubt that there are regular disagreements between the State Department and the intelligence community's inspector general about who gets to look at what.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And we know that other secretaries of state have used private e-mail addresses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She's dismissive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Yes, Ed is interrupting her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Yes, he is close to antagonistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But no, he isn't doing anything that Clinton hasn't see a billion times before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>From the start, she is quite clearly annoyed with the line of questioning and is unable to mask that fact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>(All politicians get annoyed with reporters' questions; good ones find ways not to show it.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Clinton does not believe this should be a story or that she should have to keep answering questions about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But that's not her decision to make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Politics is about dealing with the world as it is, not as you want it to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>So no, Clinton doesn't have to like that she's being subjected to more questions about her e-mail practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But she does have to do a better job at not showing just how beneath contempt she believes the issue to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She's sarcastic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Under the best possible reading, Clinton's response to whether she "wiped" the server - "like with a cloth or something?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>- is evidence of a lack of technological know-how.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Which is fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But it's hard for me to believe that, amid tons and tons of questions about what was/is on the server and whether the server was purposely erased over the last many months, Clinton is entirely unaware of what the term "wipe" means in this context.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>And if she does know, then her "with a cloth or something?" line is just terrible politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>People generally dislike sarcasm from their politicians; that's especially true when that sarcasm is tied to an issue that many people view as a very serious one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>She's wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>As Clinton is leaving the news conference, a reporter asks whether she is worried that the e-mail issue will continue to linger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Clinton responds: "Nobody talks to me about it other than you guys."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>While I can't fact-check what people talk to Clinton about every second of every day, there is new polling data that suggest that her handling of her e-mail server is of concern to a significant number of voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Fifty-six percent of those polled in a new CNN/ORC survey said that Clinton did something wrong by using a private e-mail server during her time as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Slightly more than six in 10 Democrats (63 percent) believe Clinton did nothing wrong - that's down from 71 percent in March - while slightly more than one in three independents (37 percent) say the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>So this isn't just a media creation.</td></tr>
