<h3>New video surfaces showing Freddie Gray arrest in Baltimore</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A new video has surfaced revealing a key part of the arrest of Freddie Gray, the Baltimore black man whose death from injuries sustained in police custody sparked riots and led to a federal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The video, shot by a bystander and posted on the Baltimore Sun's website on Wednesday, shows officers putting Gray in leg shackles and handcuffs before placing him in a police van head first and on his stomach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gray died on April 19 from spinal injuries suffered during his arrest a week earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His death touched off protests and rioting in the largely black city and heightened national tensions over police treatment of minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Six officers have been charged in Gray's death, including one with a count of murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the Baltimore Police Department for brutality and civil rights violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Officers arrested Gray in west Baltimore for possessing a switchblade knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They put him in a transport van without securing him with a seat belt, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said this month in announcing charges against the officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The video lasts a few seconds and shows the van stopped a block away from the arrest site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gray is halfway out of the wagon, his stomach flat on the floor and his legs hanging off the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He does not move as four officers stand over him and place shackles around his ankles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mosby said he also was put in handcuffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She has said that following the stop, Gray sustained a neck injury from being handcuffed, shackled and unrestrained inside the police wagon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A city surveillance camera recorded part of the scene but did not show Gray at the back of the van, the Sun reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Police said in a statement on Twitter that because of a technical glitch footage from the camera was never uploaded to the department's YouTube website with other surveillance video in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Police did not respond for a request for comment about the bystander's video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A Mosby spokeswoman had no immediate comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Baltimore has been hit by an upsurge in violence since Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The city had recorded 96 homicides for 2015 by Tuesday, compared with 69 for the same period last year, and added one overnight, according to the police Twitter feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Baltimore has posted 35 murders since Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That count includes Gray and a 2014 death that was ruled a homicide.</td></tr>
