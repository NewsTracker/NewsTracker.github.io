<h3>Indians catcher Gomes out at least 6 weeks with knee sprain (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLEVELAND (AP) -- Yan Gomes could be out of the Indians' lineup for two months, a major blow to a team expected to contend this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gomes, one of the Indians' best players, sustained a ''moderate'' sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his right knee on a play at the plate Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The team expects him to be out at least six weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An MRI at the Cleveland Clinic on Sunday revealed the sprain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gomes' leg was jolted violently by Detroit outfielder Rajai Davis, who slid hard on a force play and clipped the catcher's right leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gomes was extended at the time like a first baseman making a catch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Before Sunday's game Gomes was placed on the 15-day disabled list and he hobbled onto the field on crutches to receive his Silver Slugger Award from last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Indians manager Terry Francona was bracing for bad news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''Losing Gomes, man, that can be a season-killer,'' Francona said before the series finale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gomes is the club's top right-handed power hitter and a solid defensive player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last season, he led all AL catchers in average (.278) and extra-base hits (49).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He was second in RBIs (74) and homers (21) and handled one of baseball's youngest starting staffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Not having Gomes in the lineup or behind the plate weakens the Indians, who went 85-77 in 2014 and were in the playoff hunt until the season's final weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I think I used the word with Gomer a lot of times this spring where you like your catcher to be indispensable,'' Francona said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Roberto Perez started Sunday's game in place of Gomes, and the team will call up Brett Hayes from Triple-A Columbus on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Indians are off Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Gomes' absence was felt in the first inning Sunday when Perez overthrew third base on a double steal, allowing the Tigers to score their first run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Francona is confident that Perez, who homered earlier this week in a win at Houston, can fill in capably while Gomes is out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We're so fortunate we have Roberto,'' Francona said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''I would say the biggest thing is that every single pitcher on the staff has not one single issue throwing with Roberto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He has a little bit less experience less than Gomes, not a ton, but some.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But they all love throwing to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Perez played in 29 games last season for the Indians, who brought up the 26-year-old in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He batted .271 with one homer and four RBIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Indians also recalled right-handers Shaun Marcum and Austin Adams from Triple-A Columbus and optioned lefty Kyle Crockett to the minors.</td></tr>
