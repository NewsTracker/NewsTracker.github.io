<h3>Banana peel hits Dave Chappelle on New Mexico stage</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A man tossed a banana peel at Dave Chappelle during a stand-up show, hitting in the comedian in the leg, police in this northern New Mexico city say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Christian Englander, 30, of Santa Fe, was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor disorderly conduct and battery after the fruit throw Monday night, Santa Fe police Lt. Andrea Dobyns said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Englander acknowledged throwing a peel from a banana he had eaten earlier because he took offense to jokes Chappelle made about his companion, Dobyns said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The friend reportedly was drawing in a sketchbook during the show when Chappelle noticed and asked the man his name, which he gave as "Johnny Appleseed," Dobyns said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chappelle then made jokes about the moniker, the police spokeswoman said, "so that's when Englander got upset."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Arresting officers said Englander appeared to be intoxicated after event security escorted him outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Englander was in jail Tuesday, and Dobyns said she didn't know whether Englander has an attorney to speak on his behalf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chappelle has had run-ins with audience members before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a 2013 gig in Hartford, Connecticut, Chappelle shut down his act after 10 minutes because of heckling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Known for his commentary on race in America, Chappelle has gradually resumed his stand-up career in the past two years, making a long-awaited return after abandoning a popular Comedy Central show in 2005.</td></tr>
