<h3>Google to include tweets in search results</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google and Twitter have announced a partnership to display tweets in search results, renewing a tie-up that ended in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The move will allow Google to get more real-time results in its search queries, and help Twitter boost engagement after a period of sluggish user growth which has weighed on its stock price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're excited to team up with Google to bring Twitter's unique, real-time content to Google's search results," Twitter vice president Jana Messerschmidt said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The deal will start with search results within the Google app and mobile Web, with a desktop version coming, said Messerschmidt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"For example, if you're interested in hearing more from Taylor Swift, a quick search on Google will pull up her most recent tweets," she said in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Or, if you're a TV buff, a search for #Madmen will bring up the most relevant news and Tweets about Sunday's series finale."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The two firms had a similar arrangement dating back to 2009, but tweets disappeared from Google search results in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's a great way to get real-time info when something is happening," Google product manager Ardan Arac said in a separate post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"And it's another way for organisations and people on Twitter to reach a global audience at the most relevant moments."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Microsoft's Bing search engine has a similar function of integrating Twitter messages.</td></tr>
