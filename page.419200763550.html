<h3>'Haha' Has Killed 'LOL,' Says Facebook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>If you still &#x201C;lol&#x201D; at jokes online then you might be in the minority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A new report from Facebook into how users express laughter shows that &#x201C;haha&#x201D; and its variants are by far the most common terms used on the social network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They accounted for 51.4 percent of mirth in the anonymized comments and posts looked at by Facebook&#x2019;s data team, with&#xA0;laughter emoji claiming 33.7 percent, and &#x201C;hehe&#x201D; and its cognates 13.1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The once-mighty &#x201C;lol&#x201D; only appeared in 1.9 percent of the text sampled by Facebook &#x2014; a pretty staggering fall for an expression that was once synonymous with online txt speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Although not surprising for such a venerable term, &#x201C;lol&#x201D; proved slightly more popular with older users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Differences between generations were not heavily pronounced, but it was emoji that were most popular with users with the youngest median age, while &#x201C;haha,&#x201D; &#x201C;hehe,&#x201D; and &#x201C;lol&#x201D; were favored by progressively older individuals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The data also showed that emoji were more popular among female users, with &#x201C;haha&#x201D; showing a small male bias, and &#x201C;hehe&#x201D; distributed nearly evenly among the genders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Not may people were regular chortlers though: in the week&#x2019;s worth of data Facebook looked at, 46 percent of those that laughed in the seven days did so only once, with the vast majority &#x2014; 85 percent &#x2014; laughing fewer than five times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Two graphs showing laughter preference by age (left) and by gender (right).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Facebook&#x2019;s data team also examined how users deployed variants of these laughter terms, looking at whether they hehe&#x2019;d more than they hehehehe&#x2019;d, for example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An&#xA0;article in The New Yorker that inspired Facebook&#x2019;s analysis suggested that we use &#x201C;ha"s and "he"s as building blocks, adding up these lexical units to convey everything from polite recognition ("ha&#x201D;) to no-really-I&#x2019;m-going-a-bit-mad-with-laughter (&#x201C;hahahahahahahaha&#x201D;).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As Facebook&#x2019;s researchers&#xA0;explain: &#x201C;The most common are the four-letter hahas and hehes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The six-letter hahaha is also very common, and in general, the haha-ers use longer laughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The haha-ers are also slightly more open than the hehe-ers to using odd number of letters, and we do see the occasional hahaas and hhhhaaahhhaas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The lol almost always stands by itself, though some rare specimens of lolz and loll were found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A single emoji is used 50 percent of the time, and it&#x2019;s quite rare to see people use more than five identical consecutive emoji.&#x201D; However, Facebook&#x2019;s data scientists should probably look at Instagram, where long strings of&#xA0;Face With Tears Of Joy emoji are more common.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And judging by the&#xA0;demographics of the two social networks, this is how laughter online is likely to look in the future.</td></tr>
