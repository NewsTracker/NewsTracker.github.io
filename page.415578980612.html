<h3>One Direction stars ordered to pay 'weed bond'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One Direction stars Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson must hand nearly $5,000 each to immigration officials in the Philippines following their weed video scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The pop singers hit headlines last year when a clip circulated online showing the pair smoking a suspicious-looking hand-rolled cigarette while on tour in Peru and talking about "illegal substances" and "Mary Jane", a nickname for marijuana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Now officials in the Philippines are demanding the Brits post bonds worth nearly $5,000 each, which will be forfeited if they are caught using or promoting illegal drugs ahead of their concert in the capital Manila this weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The country's Bureau of Immigration spokeswoman said on Thursday, "The condition is intended to protect the public interest should the band members commit any violation during their stay in the Philippines."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She added that the band will not be permitted to perform if the bonds are not processed before the concert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Officials behind Filipino group Anti-Drugs Advocate have posted a petition to a local court asking government agencies to ensure the stars are drug-free and to urge the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to send officers to monitor the singers during their stay.</td></tr>
