<h3>British Ebola patient cured after experimental treatment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Anna Cross contracted the deadly disease after going to Sierra Leone last month to help care for victims of the West African outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She was brought back to Britain and successfully treated at the Royal Free in north London, Britain's main center for Ebola treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"After careful consideration Corporal Cross said she would like to be given the experimental drug MIL 77," the hospital said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"She is the first Ebola patient anywhere in the world to be given this drug."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Chinese-made MIL 77 is a close relative of another experimental medicine ZMapp - which British nurse William Pooley received when he was treated at the Royal Free for Ebola last year.</td></tr>
