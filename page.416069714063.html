<h3>Pelicans beat Warriors 103-100, move into 8th spot (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Stephen Curry scored 25 points, hitting five 3-pointers, but his final attempt that would have tied the game went in and out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That allowed the Pelicans to move back into the West's last playoff spot by a half-game over Oklahoma City, which lost to San Antonio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Now New Orleans, which has not participated in the postseason since 2011, has five games left to hold on to a playoff spot and owns a tiebreaker over the Thunder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Pelicans, who overcame a double-digit halftime deficit, also needed a late surge to pull out arguably their biggest victory this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After Curry's layup gave the Warriors a 95-92 lead with 3:04 left, the Pelicans responded with an 8-0 run during which they benefited from three Golden State turnovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Quincy Pondexter, who had 20 points, began the spurt with his fourth 3 on four attempts to tie it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With 1:21 left, Davis used a pump fake on the perimeter to get past one defender and then hit a floater as he was fouled by Andrew Bogut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cunningham added a free throw to make it 100-95 with 1:12 left, but Golden State tied it at 100 soon after on Curry's 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tyreke Evans, who scored 12, hit a late free throw after hustling to prevent what could have been a costly turnover in the final half-minute, and Davis added two more foul shots for the final marking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Draymond Green had 24 points and Bogut blocked nine shots for NBA-leading Golden State, which has tied its season-high losing streak at a mere two games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ryan Anderson scored 12 points for New Orleans, while Eric Gordon added 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Davis and Omer Asik each grabbed 10 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Trailing by 12 at halftime, New Orleans stormed back into the game with a 10-0 run to open the third quarter, with Davis hitting two jumpers while Asik scored six on two putbacks and two free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Asik's aggressiveness lured Bogut into three quick fouls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He went to the bench with four fouls with 9 minutes left in the quarter, removing the defensive presence of a player who'd already blocked eight shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Davis wound up with 13 points in the third quarter, when New Orleans outscored the Warriors by 13 to carry a 79-78 lead into fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Pelicans trailed 41-38 on Davis' free throw late in the second quarter, then Golden State closed the half on a 14-3 run that included four straight 3s - the first by Green and then three by Curry - to make it 55-43 at halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Warriors: Bogut had seven blocks and scored six points in the first half, when the Warriors were plus-17 with him on the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>... Golden State closed out its regular season road slate at 28-13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>... Golden State has lost two straight four times this season, the last time coming on Jan. 27 (vs. Chicago) and 30 (at Utah).</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Pelicans: New Orleans came in having lost its previous 10 to the Warriors, with its last victory in the series coming on April 24, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>... Davis made five of six shots in the third quarter after hitting two of his first 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Warriors: Host Portland on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Pelicans: Visit Memphis on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
