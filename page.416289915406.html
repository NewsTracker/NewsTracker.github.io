<h3>Blind vendors scuffle with Mexico City police</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) " Blind vendors angry about having their stalls removed from a downtown Mexico City subway station this week clashed with police outside city hall Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Authorities said two of the estimated 150 vendors and 13 police officers suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The city government had said five protesters were injured, but later lowered the number of injured vendors and reported police injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Vendors are angry about a campaign to clean up the subway station's hallways by clearing out long-tolerated vendors' stands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Subway authorities said the cleanup was needed to make room for passengers to walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Protesters marched from the station to city hall, but were prevented from entering by a line of police with plastic shields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Scuffling broke out when vendors banged on the shields and tried to push officers out of the way in a failed bid to get inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The city said in a press statement that it "prefers to use constructive and respectful dialogue, without violence, and remains in contact with the protesters."</td></tr>
