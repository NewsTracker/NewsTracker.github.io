<h3>Separatists poised for offensive in Ukraine: US</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington (AFP) - Pro-Russian separatists appear to be making preparations for a fresh offensive in eastern Ukraine, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told lawmakers on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Pentagon chief also said that sanctions imposed by European countries and a decline in oil prices were the most effective way to exert pressure on Russia over its role in the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It does appear that clearly, Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine are preparing for another round of military action that would be inconsistent with the Minsk agreement," Carter told the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A shaky truce agreed in Minsk in February has dampened the violence overall but clashes continue to erupt in pivotal flashpoints.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukrainian government forces and analysts have warned that pro-Moscow rebels are readying for a push to extend their control to the key seaport of Mariupol, the largest remaining Ukrainian-controlled city in the conflict zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>NATO's top commander, General Philip Breedlove, said last week actions by Russia and the separatists were "consistent" with "preparations for another offensive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The United States has provided radios, radar, armored vehicles and other non-lethal supplies to Kiev but so far stopped short of providing weapons to the government army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Carter said that "if there is anything that influences Russian behavior, it's the combination of economic sanctions and the fall in oil prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That is punishing Russia now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He added that "it is the weight of European sanctions that matters, mostly because they do most of the trade done with Russia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Carter spoke as Ukraine's warring sides met in Minsk to shore up the ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ukraine's representative, former president Leonid Kuchma, said after the meeting that it had been a "serious step towards the political resolution" of the conflict but said the shooting had to stop completely.</td></tr>
