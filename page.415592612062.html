<h3>Lisicki edges Pennetta, faces Jankovic in semis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 24th seed advances to face Jelena Jankovic in the semi-finals on Friday after the Serb progressed when Ukrainian qualifier Lesia Tsurenko retired from their last eight encounter with an ankle injury while trailing 6-1 4-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lisicki nearly sealed a straight sets win when she earned her first match point while holding a 5-4 advantage in the second before the Italian produced a magical shot to spark a rally that leveled the match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Pennetta then forged three match points of her own at 5-4 in the decider before Lisicki fought back to claim victory in a tiebreaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's unbelievable," Lisicki said in a courtside interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's such a great feeling to be part of such a great match. She saved a match point with an unbelievable backhand. I could not have done much different there and then I saved three match points in the third set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was just an unbelievable feeling to play in front of all of you," she added for the fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Former champion Jankovic, meanwhile, broke an error-prone Tsurenko twice to breeze through the opening set in 22 minutes and twice more in the second before the Ukrainian walked across to her opponent and told her the match was over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's never nice to end a match in that way," Serb Jankovic, 30, said on another hot day at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"In the second set, she started limping and I saw that she had some problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I had to just focus on my game and try to make as many balls as possible in the point. I was feeling pretty good out there. I was playing my game and waiting for my chances to execute. I was solid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I'm really sorry she got injured. She has had such a great tournament, she has beaten a lot of great players in the draw. Unfortunately she couldn't play a great match today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tsurenko, ranked 85th in the world, injured her right ankle during her upset of sixth-seeded Canadian Eugenie Bouchard in the previous round and was noticeably restricted in her movement against Jankovic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She failed to hold serve in the second and sixth games of the match to be swept aside in the opening set before calling for her trainer to re-tape her ankle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tsurenko, who double-faulted five times during the curtailed match, was again broken in the first and fifth games of the second set before she retired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The other semi-final will be contested by Romanian Simona Halep and top seed Serena Williams, back at Indian Wells after a 14-year boycott of the event where she alleged she had suffered racist abuse from fans.</td></tr>

<h3>Anya's last-second leaner lifts NC State past LSU 66-65 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Then the burly forward made the only two that mattered in the final 45 seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Anya's tip-in got North Carolina State within a point of LSU and his left-handed hook just before the buzzer lifted the eight-seeded Wolfpack to a 66-65 victory in the NCAA Tournament on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The final play was designed for teammate Trevor Lacey, but LSU bottled up the senior guard, and the ball ended up in Anya's willing hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I was like know what, it's time for me to shoot the ball,'' Anya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''Trevor called for it back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He had a chance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Just as importantly, it was his time to make it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Next up for the Wolfpack (21-13) is top-seeded Villanova on Saturday thanks to Anya's deft touch and a maddening collapse by the Tigers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>LSU (22-11) led by 16 early in the second half but missed its last 12 field goals and six crucial free throws in the final minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''We wasn't ready for our season to end right now,'' LSU sophomore forward Jarell Martin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Just not the last one, even if it wasn't quite the way coach Mark Gottfried drew it up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Beejay just made an instinctive play,'' Gottfried said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Cat Barber led N.C. State with 17 points and Abdul-Malik Abu added 13 as the Wolfpack provided another jolt during a typically frantic opening day of the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>N.C. State's win was the fifth one-point game of the day, a record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''Amazing things can happen,'' Gottfried said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''Today was a great day, exciting day in that regard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tim Quarterman led LSU with 17 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Martin had 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Jordan Mickey had 12 points and 14 boards for the Tigers, who appeared to be in firm control before the latest and most painful collapse during an otherwise promising season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A week after falling to Auburn in the Southeastern Conference tournament, the Tigers' breakout season under third-year coach Johnny Jones ended with a thud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''We weren't able to convert on the offensive end,'' Martin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Jones admitted he wasn't sure how his young team would react while making the program's first NCAA appearance in six years, maybe because the Tigers have been a talented but uneven work in progress all winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>LSU alleviated any of Jones' concerns early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Riding the athleticism of their two sophomore big men and Quarterman's budding confidence, the Tigers attacked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>LSU filled the lane repeatedly, soaring over the Wolfpack at times and racing around them at others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>During one sequence in the first half, Martin banked in a running layup, and then followed with a putback dunk in which his right hand appeared to be even with the square on the backboard before he grabbed the ball and slammed it through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mickey ended the half with a traditional three-point play, and then a dunk as the Tigers took a seemingly commanding 40-26 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Like just about everything else this year for the Tigers, comfort was fleeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The future might be bright in Baton Rouge, but it's not exactly clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Martin and Mickey were first-team All-SEC selections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Now they head back to campus weighing whether to return for one more run or test the professional waters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I'll get with coach Jones, my parents and we'll come to a conclusion,'' Martin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>LSU: The Tigers finished 12 of 22 at the free-throw line and shot just 29 percent (7 of 24) in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>... LSU outscored 28 points in the paint alone in the first half, more than N.C. State managed during the opening 20 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>N.C. State: The Wolfpack made just 5 of 24 3-pointers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>... Lacey had nine points and nine rebounds in 38 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>... Former LSU player Ralston Turner had 10 points against his former team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>LSU's season is over.</td></tr>
