<h3>Syrian rebels battle Islamic militants near Golan Heights</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BEIRUT (AP) - Mainstream Syrian rebels are battling Islamists suspected of links to the Islamic State group in a southern province near the Israeli-held Golan Heights, with at least 29 people killed in days of clashes, a spokesman and activists said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The IS group is not known to have a significant presence in southern Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, Isam al-Rayess, spokesman for the Free Syrian Army's Southern Front, said a group known as Jihad Units ambushed some of his fighters in the Quneitra province who were on their way to join an offensive against forces loyal to President Bashar Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said the Southern Front, a rebel coalition, has long suspected the Jihad Units of being loyal to the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After the ambush, the Islamic militants raised black flags similar to those carried by the IS group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Six of the Southern Front fighters were killed in the ambush, al-Rayess said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Soon after, another ambush resulted in the kidnapping of two fighters, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 29 people, including at least nine from the Jihad Units and two Saudi nationals, have been killed in the fighting since Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The rebels have vowed to clear the Jihad Units from the province, and al-Rayess said his men are currently besieging about 200 Jihad Units fighters in a village south of Quneitra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fighters from the al-Qaida-affiliated Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham, a hard-line Islamic rebel group, have also joined in the fight against the Jihad Units, al-Rayess said, although there is no coordination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We will not allow for the presence of Daesh in the southern front," al-Rayess said in a telephone interview, referring to the IS group by its Arabic acronym.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In an offensive last year, the rebels seized most of the Quneitra province, which is also considered a gateway to the capital.</td></tr>
