<h3>Yanis Varoufakis talks his way out of restaurant confrontation with anarchists</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's outspoken finance minister and his wife came under attack by anarchists while dining in a central Athens restaurant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yanis Varoufakis said the couple were finishing dinner on Tuesday night with a friend in the Exarhia district, a neighbourhood popular with leftists and anarchists, when the group barged into the restaurant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The anarchists, who had their faces covered, demanded the minister leave the area and threw glass objects at the couple, Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Neither of them was hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said that when members of the group moved in a threatening manner against him, his wife, Danae Stratou, embraced him so that the potential attackers could not get at him without hitting her first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This was not an organised incident," Varoufakis said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said he eventually spoke with the group outside the restaurant and tempers were calmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Similar attacks against government ministers were frequent in the first years of Greece's bailout, which began in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Those were believed to have been carried out by leftwing groups, though generally not by anarchists, and sometimes involved attempted physical violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With his outspoken style and prolific media appearances, Varoufakis became Greece's best-known minister of the new radical left Syriza party-led coalition government following the 25 January elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he has come under criticism from the country's European creditors, with whom negotiations on unlocking the final 7.2bn instalment of Greece's bailout have stalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Monday, Greece announced a reshuffle of its negotiating team, which was widely seen as a sidelining of Varoufakis.</td></tr>
