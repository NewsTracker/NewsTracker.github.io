<h3>Author of Iran letter has 'no regrets at all'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>says he has no regrets about spearheading a letter to Iran's leaders warning any nuclear deal negotiated with international powers could be revoked in two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cotton told CBS's "Face the Nation" Sunday that he has "no regrets at all" and accused President Obama of "not negotiating for the hardest deal possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He argued that, if Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are trying to negotiate the toughest possible deal, they would be glad to point to Cotton's letter - which 46 other Senate Republicans signed - to gain leverage in the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said he wrote the letter because "Iran's leaders needed to hear the message loud and clear."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He argued that Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, indicated he did not fully understand U.S. constitutional law by urging the Obama administration to go straight to the United Nations to finalize a nuclear agreement, bypassing Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He thinks that international law can override our constitutional system," Cotton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In an interview with CBS aired earlier on the same program, Secretary of State John Kerry slammed Cotton's letter as an "unprecedented" and "calculated" attempt to interfere with negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Cotton's action "outrageous" and compared it to a hypothetical scenario of lawmakers sending a letter to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to undermine President Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Cotton dismissed both critiques.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said Kerry's comments to CBS appeared to backtrack from his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I'm surprised by Secretary Kerry's comments this morning because just a few days ago he testified before the Senate to say any deal would not be legally binding," Cotton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"And now he says that future Congresses cannot change a mere executive agreement if we disagree with them or if a future president disagrees with them?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said Albright, while the nation's top diplomat during the Clinton administration, entered into a "fundamentally flawed" nuclear agreement with North Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"They almost immediately started cheating on it, and a near 12 years later they detonated their first nuclear weapon. Now the world has to live with the consequences of a nuclear North Korea," he said.</td></tr>
