<h3>Mexico's congress approves reform letting some foreign agents carry weapons inside country</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY - Mexico's congress approved on Thursday a reform that lets some foreign agents carry arms inside the country, a significant change in a nation that has historically said the practice would violate its sovereignty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Under the law, foreign customs and migration agents will be allowed to carry guns in previously established zones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Also, foreign leaders or heads of state will be able to enter Mexico with armed security details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officials say the presence of foreign agents in Mexico will speed up the joint inspection process and facilitate the flow of goods and people across borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They also say foreign customs and migration agents at times need guns to guarantee their security given the problems of drug and human trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The bill, which was proposed by President Enrique Pena Nieto, was passed earlier by Mexico's Senate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Thursday, the Chamber of Deputies approved it 288 votes to 82, with nine abstentions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It will now be sent to the executive branch to be published and go into effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Previously, Mexican law prohibited any foreign agent or official from carrying weapons inside the country or participating in operations to arrest criminals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Authorities have always denied media reports of U.S. agents directly taking part in anti-drug trafficking operations inside Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Permits will be limited to revolvers or semi-automatic pistols with a caliber less than .40 and be granted by Mexico's national defense department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The initiative demands reciprocity, implying that the foreign government would also allow Mexican agents to carry guns in its territory.</td></tr>
