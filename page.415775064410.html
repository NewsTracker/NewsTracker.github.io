<h3>Ukraine seeks resumption of Turkmen gas supplies</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KIEV, Ukraine (AP) " Ukraine has said it wants to restore natural gas deliveries from energy-rich Turkmenistan as it tries to reduce reliance on Russia for the fuel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's office said in a statement Friday that the option was discussed during talks with the visiting Turkmen foreign minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The meeting took place Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Until 2006, Turkmenistan supplied Ukraine with 36 billion cubic meters (1.3 trillion cubic feet) of gas annually in exchange for cash and goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Turkmenistan wishes to widen its client base, while Ukraine wants to wean itself off Russian gas, so any deal would be eagerly embraced by both parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A deal would require acquiescence from Kazakhstan and Russia as transit nations, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kazakhstan is unlikely to pose an obstacle, but Russia would be expected to be less forthcoming.</td></tr>
