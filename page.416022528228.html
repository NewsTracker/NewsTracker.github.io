<h3>Sport24.co.za | Holmes wins Houston Open in playoff</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Houston - JB Holmes fashioned an electrifying final round, then held on to win the Houston Open in a three-way playoff Sunday for a perfect final preparation for next week's Masters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Anytime you can get a win it's a big step coming into a major," said Holmes, who beat Johnson Wagner with a par at the second hole of sudden death after Jordan Spieth was eliminated at the first playoff hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Hopefully I'll be ready next week," Holmes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Holmes started the day six shots adrift of overnight leader Spieth and surged up the leaderboard with seven birdies in his first nine holes - nine of his first 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He had just one bogey in an eight-under 64, then waited for almost two hours before he was joined on 16-under 272 by Wagner and Spieth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Spieth closed with a 70 while Wagner, playing on a sponsor's exemption, made just the third birdie of the day at the Golf Club of Houston's tough 18th hole to cap a 69 and join the playoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The trio returned to 18, where Holmes and Wagner were in the fairway but Spieth's shot off the tee rolled down the bank toward the water hazard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Holmes's second shot left him a long birdie attempt and he two-putted for par, while Wagner got up and down for par from a bunker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Spieth's awkward second shot left him in a bunker and he was eliminated with a bogey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>From the 18th tee again, Holmes and Wagner both found the fairway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Holmes gave himself a 10-foot birdie putt, while Wagner left himself a difficult effort over the ridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Holmes' birdie effort trickled right, but his par proved good enough when Wagner's five-foot par putt failed to drop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Wagner had been hoping to duplicate his fairytale win in this event in 2008 -- his first US PGA Tour title giving him a Masters berth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He's had his struggles since then, including losing his tour card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Losing out on the trophy and a spot in the year's first major was a blow, but being in contention was a sign of progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Birdying 18 to even get in the playoff was pretty incredible," Wagner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I'm pretty bummed right now, I love this event. I'm really pretty disappointed, But there's a lot of good stuff going on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Spieth, who finished runner-up to Bubba Watson in his Masters debut last year, still takes plenty of confidence into Augusta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He won the Valspar championship and finished second in the Texas Open in his two prior starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I feel as prepared as I think I could be," said the 21-year-old Texan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I've felt more and more comfortable with more and more pressure. That gives me a lot of confidence going into Augusta."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Russell Henley finished alone in fourth after a 69 for 274.</td></tr>
