<h3>Blast in Egypt's North Sinai kills five soldiers: security source</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>North Sinai is the epicenter of an insurgency that has killed hundreds of members of the security services since mid-2013, when then army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted Islamist president Mohamed Mursi after mass protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two of the soldiers killed in the blast were officers, the sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was not immediately clear who had carried out the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An Egyptian militant group allied with Islamic State has claimed responsibility for other deadly attacks on soldiers in the Sinai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Egyptian group renamed itself Sinai Province last year after swearing allegiance to Islamic State, the hardline Sunni militant group that has seized swathes of Iraq and Syria, drawing U.S.-led airstrikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Egyptian faction had previously been known as Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis.</td></tr>
