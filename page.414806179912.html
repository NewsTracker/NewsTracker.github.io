<h3>Greek debt deal hangs in balance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis declared he was ready to do "whatever it takes" to reach agreement over its bailout after the collapse of talks with EU finance ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Varoufakis spoke after Greece rejected an EU offer to extend its current 240bn ( 178bn) bailout, a plan he called "absurd" and "unacceptable".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said he was prepared to agree a deal but under different conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the Dutch finance minister said there were just days left for talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said it was now "up to Greece" to decide if it wanted more funding or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"My strong preference is and still is to get an extension of the programme, and I think it is still feasible," Mr Dijsselbloem told a news conference after the talks collapsed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greece's current bailout expires on 28 February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Any new agreement would need to be approved by national governments, so time is running out to reach a compromise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Without a deal Greece is likely to run out of money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Varoufakis said there was still "substantial disagreement" on whether the task ahead was to complete the current programme, which Greece's newly elected government has pledged to scrap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He dismissed the promise of "some flexibility" in the programme as "nebulous" and lacking in detail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Speaking at a news conference after Mr Dijsselbloem, he said he had been presented with a draft communique by Pierre Moscovici, the EU's economics commissioner, which he had been ready to sign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However, that draft had been withdrawn minutes before the meeting started, Mr Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Two pressing financial issues loom over Greece: whether the government can pay its bills and the stability of the banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Greek officials have said the government could keep going for several months, but there are doubts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>How long it takes depends to a great extent on Greek taxpayers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The banks have already seen money being withdrawn and increasingly need central bank loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>If there is no bailout programme, the European Central Bank could pull the plug on the banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>If it came to that, it really would mean a major financial crisis, with perhaps the imposition of extensive financial controls to prop up the banks and possibly even the re-introduction of a national currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It's hard to nail down a date by which an agreement must be done to avert some sort of financial Armageddon, because it depends on the actions of taxpayers, bank customers and the ECB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But time is getting short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Does Greece have a plan?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Before the meeting, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had already said he was not optimistic a deal would be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The problem is that Greece has lived beyond its means for a long time and that nobody wants to give Greece money any more without guarantees," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said European leaders needed to respect the political change in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As he arrived in Brussels he urged the Greeks to extend their current deal to allow time for talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Greece has proposed a new bailout programme that involves a bridging loan to keep the country going for six months and help it repay 7bn ( 5.2bn) of maturing bonds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The second part of the plan would see the county's debt refinanced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Part of this might be through "GDP bonds" - bonds carrying an interest rate linked to economic growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Greece also wants to see a reduction in the primary surplus target - the surplus the government must generate (excluding interest payments on debt) - from 3% to 1.49% of GDP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In Greece last week, two opinion polls indicated that 79% of Greeks supported the government's policies, and 74% believed its negotiating strategy would succeed.</td></tr>
