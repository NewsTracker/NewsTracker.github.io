<h3>Eurogroup agrees four-month extension to Greek bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Related Story: Which Australian is charged with saving Greece's economy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eurozone finance ministers have granted Greece a crucial four-month extension to its massive debt bailout, buying time for the cash-strapped nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The hard-won deal was reached at emergency talks in Brussels that pit Greece against an angry Germany, suspicious that the new radical leftist government in Athens was looking to ditch its austerity obligations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In exchange for the extension, Greece agreed to submit a list of economic and other reforms by Monday, which its eurozone partners will then review to see if they go far enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Tuesday, they will report back to Greece and decide whether to proceed with the agreement, with the chance that the compromise be scrapped if officials are left unsatisfied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The meeting was intense because it was about building trust between us," said Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem, after the talks ended with a two-page statement setting out the tough conditions Athens will have to fulfil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"As you know, trust comes or leaves quicker than it comes. Tonight was a very important, I think, step in that process," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>What the European creditors are asking Greece to do - saying that Greece has to do - is to do some homework over the weekend, essentially.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They need to say what reforms they're going to provide to make sure that they keep to the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And that is obviously something that Germany's going to be very happy with, because Germany wanted that greater accountability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So Greece needs to go away and talk about their reform ambitions by Monday and then that will be assessed by the institutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And then, if that goes ahead and all of this is passed off by all of the national governments around the eurozone, then the next step will be April and that will be another deadline to see if those reforms are in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>People are saying: this is just a suspended crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's an exercise to buy time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That can't be underestimated, of course, because Greece was really on the brink, potentially, of running out of cash and leaving open the prospect of crashing out of the Euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>So buying time is clearly very valuable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But people will go away from this meeting, obviously, still acknowledging that long-term solutions have yet to be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Now, what reforms will it have to tie itself into?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>How much accountability will it have?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It's already agreed to have these European creditors supervise this process and that's a backtracking on some of its promises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Does this government risk backlash within its own country?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And will those reforms be passed by the Greek government?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I'm glad to report to you that the work that we've done over the last weeks has paid off. We have established common ground again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"To summarise, let me say that I think this is a very positive outcome. It will allow us, step by step, to get the work we have to do together with the Greeks back on track and hopefully we can make a good start with that next week."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The agreement removes the immediate risk of Greece running out of money next month and possibly being forced out of the single currency area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It provides a breathing space for the new leftist-led Athens government to try to negotiate longer-term debt relief with its official creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>If Athens sticks to its commitments, it stands to receive up to 7.2 billion euros in funds still left in the EU portion of its 240 billion euro bailout ($273 million).</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Officials said the outline deal was reached in preparatory talks involving the Greek and German finance ministers, as well as the managing director of the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It was then agreed by the full 19-member Eurogroup, ending weeks of uncertainty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said the deal marked a new era for Athens and its relationship with the European Union, after two painful bailouts put together at the height of the debt crisis to save the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Athens claimed the rescues and the austerity measures it had to follow since its first 2010 bailout had wrecked the Greek economy, making it impossible to manage its mountain of debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Today was a pivotal moment because Greece for five years now has been lonely, isolated in the Eurogroup. Today that isolation has broken," Mr Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>However, he warned: "If the list of reforms is not agreed, this agreement is dead."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The effort to agree a deal torpedoed two earlier Eurogroup meetings, with deep divisions emerging between Greece and its eurozone partners over the conditions of extending the bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Greece formally requested a six-month loan extension on Thursday, offering concessions including a return - if not in name - of the hated "troika" of creditors that had audited the Greek economy in the last years during the bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Eurogroup head Mr Dijsselbloem worked overtime to get the make-or-break deal as Germany insisted Greece stick with the austerity commitments included in its bailout program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The fraught discussions focused on a new package of concessions beyond those contained in the Greek request submitted on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Up to the very end, the deal with Greece seemed fragile, with its possible exit of Greece from the eurozone an increasing risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The specifics of the deal will be a hard read in Athens, especially for supporters of the ruling Syriza party who had hoped for the end of the austerity and creditor oversight so loathed by the Greeks.</td></tr>
