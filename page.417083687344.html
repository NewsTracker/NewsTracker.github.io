<h3>Merkel: Global catastrophe plan needed after Ebola crisis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Ebola crisis in western Africa showed the world in a painful way that a global catastrophe plan is needed to deal with future epidemics, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The struggle (against Ebola) is only won if there are no new cases and if we have learned the lessons from this crisis: we should have reacted earlier," Merkel told the 68th World Health Assembly in Geneva.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The World Health Organization has been criticized for its slow response to early warnings about the Ebola outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>More than 11,000 people have died in the outbreak since the first cases became public in rural Guinea in March 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Merkel said that WHO structures need to become more efficient, suggesting that the organization has to become more centralized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An independent panel of experts is currently looking into the WHO's slow response to early warnings about the Ebola outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The panel said last week in its first report that "deep and substantial" change is needed at the World Health Organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After studying what went wrong in the WHO's response to the Ebola crisis, the panel said it's still not clear why the global body took so long to heed warnings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Looking forward, the chancellor said Germany would give 200 million euros ($228 million) to help developing countries build up better-functioning health care systems - which she said was essential to deal with future epidemic outbreaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She said 70 million euros of this would go specifically to the Ebola-ridden countries in western Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If we react faster, and act faster, we will manage to better prevent a crisis like Ebola the next time," Merkel told the assembly, which is the WHO's decision-making body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It is attended by delegations of all WHO member states and meets annually in Geneva, Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ebola continues to spread in Guinea and Sierra Leone, while Liberia was declared Ebola-free earlier this month.</td></tr>
