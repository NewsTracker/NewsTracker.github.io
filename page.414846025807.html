<h3>Barbara Kay: In defence of the Jewish Defence League</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An example: Two Jews about to be executed by a Nazi firing squad are asked if they have a final request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One says he would love to smoke a last cigarette.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His companion quietly admonishes him: "Shush, Moishe. Don't make trouble!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There's almost no era when this joke wouldn't resonate with Jews in the Diaspora.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It speaks to the invariable tendency of Jews to retreat into accommodation and exaggerated deference to political power in the face of overt anti-Semitism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Not all Jews, of course, but certainly it is a common trait in those appointed - often self-appointed - as the official voice of the Jewish community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>So it is no surprise that Canadian Jewry's official voice, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) and its Montreal subsidiary, the Montreal Centre for Jewish Affairs, expressed vigorous opposition to the Jewish Defence League's launch of their new Montreal branch at a public meeting the evening of Feb 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hours before the event, Montreal Rabbi Reuben Poupko issued a formal statement on behalf of CIJA: "The JDL is a small marginal group that does not receive any substantial support within our community. By claiming that the Jews of Quebec need a rapid response team to anti-Semitic threats, the JDL is irresponsibly contributing to the creation of a climate of fear within the Jewish community."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, firmly on CIJA's side, tweeted: "Message to JDL: You are not welcome in Mtl! The Jewish community doesn't need the Jewish Defence League."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>I'd agree that the JDL is a small group, and not mainstream, but whether it is contributing to a climate of fear or responding to reasonable fears is certainly debatable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>From the fulminations of those opposed to JDL, one might get the impression that this is a group that promotes violence, which it most certainly does not, or that the group is appropriating the responsibilities and powers of the police, which is also not the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>JDL marshals never carry weapons or initiate physical contact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They have never been involved in any violent incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And far from setting themselves up as rivals to the police and other law enforcement agencies, the JDL supports and enhances their work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The proof is that they are on excellent terms with the Toronto police, CSIS and the RCMP, who have all benefited from JDL research and informed leads in combatting terrorism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was not the official Jewish community that got the infamous Holocaust denier and Judeophobe Ernst Zundel busted and returned to Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It was information turned over to Attorney-general Roy McMurtry by the JDL working in collaboration with Holocaust survivor Sabrina Citron that lost Zundel his mailing privileges, and subsequently to charges that stuck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It was not CIJA that got the despicably and overtly anti-Semitic Palestine House in Toronto defunded of their millions in grants; it was the JDL, through information they dug out and passed along to grateful government authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It is not CIJA that stands shoulder to shoulder in the streets with Jews protesting Hamas and Hizbollah supporters screaming "Death to Israel"; it is the JDL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It wasn't CIJA that organized a counter-rally to the 2014 Toronto Al-Quds Day rally, whose members in 2013 had called for the shooting of Jews in Jerusalem; it was the JDL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And as much as I trust the police to ensure basic law and order in demonstrations like the intimidating Al-Quds rallies, no police officer is going to stand beside me personally to face down the hateful words of anti-Semites in their hundreds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The JDL gives individual Jews the confidence to confront their enemies peacefully The JDL does not look for physical trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Their method is to keep watch and alert police to troublemakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Far from fear-mongering, I call that confidence-mongering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And Jews need confidence, especially young Jews on campus today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Its' a funny thing about Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They hate violence and civil disobedience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That is, they hate it when it is deployed in their own interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They have no problem with adopting civil disobedience and necessary violence when it comes to supporting the human rights and security of others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Jews flocked to Selma to support civil rights for blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Jews are in the forefront of the "free Gaza" movement, which involves both illegality and violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>CIJA doesn't get worked up about that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Anti-Semitism is on the rise everywhere, including Canadian Islamism-fuelled activist groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Violence against Jews is a commonplace once again in Europe and could erupt here any time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The reflexive instinct of "official" Jews to say "Shush. Don't make trouble" when one can actually see the rifles of the firing squad being loaded is to repeat a history of passivity whose horrible outcome should have ruled out such superannuated strategies forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The JDL is filling - responsibly, prudently, judiciously - a necessary gap in a grey area that CIJA is unwilling, and law enforcement agencies aren't equipped, to occupy.</td></tr>

<h3>Islamic State might be harvesting organs, Iraq envoy to U.N. says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A video purporting to show the mass beheading of Coptic Christian hostages was released Sunday by militants in Libya affiliated with the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have bodies. Come and examine them," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is clear they are missing certain parts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He also said a dozen doctors have been "executed" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of "crimes of genocide" in targeting certain ethnic groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that "it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He used an acronym for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control," Mladenov said.</td></tr>
