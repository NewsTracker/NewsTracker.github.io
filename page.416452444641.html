<h3>Shares, euro sag after euro zone PMIs disappoint</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON (Reuters) - World shares weathered soft readings on Chinese and Japanese manufacturing on Thursday that merely drove expectations of more policy stimulus there, though lacklustre euro zone data was less well received.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>European stock markets opened higher, spurred by multi-year highs in Asia, but the mood soured after sluggish euro zone and German purchasing manager data followed another dire set of numbers from France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It meant that, overall, euro zone private sector business growth was weaker than forecast, despite a big fall in the euro that could support exports and the launch in March of a much-awaited sovereign bond buying programme from the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There was very little positive to take away from the French numbers," said Timo Del Carpio a European economist at RBC in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We will have to wait and see, but so far the signal is that it is a weak start to Q2."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The euro headed lower against the dollar but European bond markets largely shrugged off the data as they steadied after UK Gilts GB10YT=RR and German Bunds DE10YT=RR had led a lively sell-off on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Traders were still cheering what had been another stellar session for stocks in Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among the milestones were a 15-year peak for Japan, seven years for both China and Taiwan and a near four-year top for South Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS added 0.5 percent to reach ground last trod in early 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The gains came despite a dip in the HSBC China manufacturing PMI to a one-year trough of 49.2 in April, when the consensus had been for it to hold steady at 49.6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Neither was the news bright from Japan where the Markit/JMMA flash PMI fell to 49.7 in April from a final 50.3 in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But that merely added to speculation that further easing would be required from central banks in both countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Japan's Nikkei .N225 was up 0.3 percent while South Korea .KS11 gained 1.4 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Shanghai stocks .SSEC climbed 1 percent, with investors still emboldened by a commentary in state media saying the bull market "has just begun".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Investors only care about the attitude of the government, which has so far appeared tolerant (of the rise)," said Du Changchun, analyst at Northeast Securities in Shanghai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>With U.S PMI's also due later, early futures prices pointed to a subdued start for Wall Street after 0.4-0.5 percent gains for the main U.S. markets on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sterling, which had jumped alongside UK Gilt yields on Wednesday after minutes of the Bank of England's last policy meeting were taken as less than dovish by a crowded market, gave back some of the gains to sit at $1.4980 in early trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The New Zealand dollar took a hit after a central banker said rate cuts could be considered if domestic demand and inflationary pressures were to weaken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The currency shed half a U.S. cent to $0.7562 NZD=D4 as Reserve Bank of New Zealand Assistant Governor John McDermott emphasised that policy needed to stay stimulative to get inflation higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The euro, which lost ground to stand at $1.0684 EUR=, remains stuck in the $1.0520-$1.0849 range of the past few weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Traders remain sensitive to worries about Greece, but clear signals on that front are unlikely before Monday's Eurogroup meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Against the yen, the dollar was firm around 119.86 JPY= and on track for its fourth straight session of gains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In commodity markets, spot gold XAU= was down at $1,188.61 an ounce having suffered its sharpest single-session loss since March 6 on Wednesday.</td></tr>
