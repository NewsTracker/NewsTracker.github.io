<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) " A court in Bangladesh's capital on Wednesday indicted a leader of a hard-line Islamist group and seven students in the hacking death of an atheist blogger two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Metropolitan Sessions court issued the indictments after accepting the police investigation into the killing of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in front of his house in Dhaka's Mirpur area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The indictments mean a trial will begin for Mufti Jasimuddin Rahmani, head of the Ansarullah Bangla Team, and six students at North South University who earlier confessed involvement in the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A seventh student said to have planned the attack is in hiding.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>The judge set April 21 for the start of the trial, and the seventh student will be tried in absentia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Islamic extremism has made few inroads in Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people, but there have been a series of similar attacks in recent years blamed on militants.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Haider had criticized the Prophet Muhammad and Islam in his blog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He was also a leading campaigner for banning the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, which opposed Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971.</td></tr>
