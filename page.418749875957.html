<h3>Microsoft Joins Effort to Curb 'Revenge Porn'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Microsoft announced Wednesday it was joining an effort to curb so-called "revenge porn," by helping victims remove links to sexually explicit images of them posted without their consent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"When someone shares intimate images of another person online without that person s consent, the effects can be truly devastating," said Microsoft chief online safety office Jacqueline Beauchere in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Unfortunately, revenge porn is on the rise across the globe. It can damage nearly every aspect of a victim s life: relationships, career, social activities. In the most severe and tragic cases, it has even led to suicide."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Beauchere said Microsoft has honored requests to take down such content, but that it has now established a new reporting page that makes the process easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The page is currently available in English "and will be expanded to other languages in the coming weeks," Beauchere said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"When we remove links or content, we will do so globally."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Clearly, this reporting mechanism is but one small step in a growing and much-needed effort across the public and private sectors to address the problem," Beauchere said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It s important to remember, for example, that removing links in search results to content hosted elsewhere online doesn t actually remove the content from the Internet -- victims still need stronger protections across the Web and around the world."</td></tr>
