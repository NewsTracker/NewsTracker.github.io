<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"We will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care and we're in the process of transitioning over to do that," Cruz, a conservative Republican from Texas, told the Des Moines Register.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cruz, who has repeatedly called for Congress to repeal Obama's Affordable Care Act, finds himself in need of insurance because his wife is taking an unpaid leave of absence from her job at Goldman Sachs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He had been receiving coverage under his wife's employee health coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Under the law, members of Congress are required to purchase their health care through Obamacare exchanges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Well, it is written in the law that members will be on the exchanges without subsidies just like millions of Americans so that's - I think the same rules should apply to all of us," Cruz told the newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Members of Congress should not be exempt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cruz, however, still believes Obamacare should be repealed.</td></tr>
