<h3>Sheriff calls for changes after 4 hurt, 10 briefly escaped in riot, fires at juvenile camp</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- The state of Nevada has removed all youths in its custody from a rural juvenile rehabilitation center where a riot erupted over the weekend - the fourth uprising there in four months, a state official said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>All four youths who had been housed at the privately owned center under the jurisdiction of the Nevada Division of Child & Family Services were sent to other facilities after the most recent outbreak of violence at the Rite of Passage-Silver State Academy near Yerington about 70 miles southeast of Reno, said Chrystal Main, the division's social services chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"My agency has no children there effective (Tuesday) or the day before. We removed them after the latest uprising," Main told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Main declined to specify whether they were removed out of concern for their safety or if they had been involved in the uprising that sent one staff member to the hospital and hurt three others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Nevada agency "wanted to ensure our youth were in the most appropriate placement," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Most of the residents of the facility for at-risk teens are there on court orders from California as an alternative to prison, Main said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Authorities say about 25 teenagers were at the facility on tribal land when some armed themselves with makeshift weapons and set fire to two buildings Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ten escaped, but they were recaptured by the following day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The state fire marshal is investigating the arsons, and Yerington Tribal Police are looking into the cause of the riot, Lyon County Sheriff Al McNeil said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He is increasingly concerned about the safety of the community and is pressing school officials to make changes so it doesn't happen again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>State records in Nevada and California show the school has been under scrutiny for several years based on complaints about staff shortages and a lack of supervision of the facility that opened in 1987.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It housed as many as 163 youths in 1999, but 100 or fewer since 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Main said 25 youths from Nevada were there last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She said Wednesday she doesn't know if any more would be sent there in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Her division doesn't have any regulatory oversight of the academy itself, only the Nevada individuals ordered there, Main said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The academy's population averaged 72 with a capacity of 110 for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2014, according to the Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Counsel Bureau's audit division concluded in a report in October 2011 the academy "adequately protects the health, safety and welfare of the children."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But it cited a number of areas where improvement was needed, including the administration of medication, security of facility keys and the need to "strengthen its supervision of youths."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>During a site visit that June, state officials noted "three instances of inadequate supervision" when staff to youth ratios ranged from 1-to-14 to 1-to-25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The recommended ratio is 1-to-6 during day shifts, not to exceed 1-to-8 at other times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Although ROP-SSA is licensed as a group home, it serves medium to high at-risk youth. Inadequate supervision may have contributed to youth searching for inappropriate websites, youth using inappropriate language and contraband type items noted on campus," according to the 2011 audit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Inadequate supervision of youths could result in other inappropriate behaviors and unsafe conditions," said the report, which noted that school officials responded that they have since instructed staff to ensure ratios are kept in compliance with recommended standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The academy is a nonprofit, private school operated by the Rite of Passage Adolescent Treatment Centers and Schools based in Minden, Nevada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It is licensed by Yerington Paiute Tribe and the California Department of Social Services' Community Care Licensing Division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Officials for the state agency in Sacramento did not immediately respond to telephone calls or emails seeking comment Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The agency's website indicates the out-of-state group home license was recertified in August 2013, effective through June 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>More current records were not immediately available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The California agency had placed the facility on a semi-annual review instead of the normal annual in 2012 after a series of complaints ranging from treatment of teens to facility conditions and background checks for staff.</td></tr>

<h3>US, Iran resume nuclear talks after Netanyahu speech</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington was well aware of the potential nuclear danger Iran poses to countries in the region and will endorse only an agreement that seriously and verifiably crimps Tehran's ability to make atomic arms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We continue to be focused on reaching a good deal, the right deal, that closes off any paths that Iran could have towards fissile material for a weapon and that protects the world from the enormous threat that we all know a nuclear-armed Iran would pose," Kerry told reporters at the end of meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Iranian diplomat told NBC News on Wednesday, "We believe that we are very close, very close."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The sides hope to have a progress report by late March allowing them to finesse details into a final pact by June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But a senior U.S. official appeared to walk back from the significance of that first stage, describing it as only "an understanding that's going to have to be filled out with lots of detail" by the June final target date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The official's comments could be an attempt to stretch the interpretation of what should be achieved by March, allowing further negotiations even if nothing more is achieved than a vague declaration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Justifying an extension of the talks on Nov. 24, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond of Britain - one of the five powers backing the U.S. at the talks - said he expected "an agreement on substance" by March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Western and Iranian negotiators said then they would use the time between March and June only "if necessary ... to finalize any possible remaining technical and drafting work."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.S. official, who demanded anonymity in line with State Department rules, said President Barack Obama will make a call on whether to continue into June once he sees the March assessment from U.S. negotiators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Playing down the prospects of any lasting damage to U.S.-Israeli ties caused by Netanyahu's speech to the joint houses of Congress Tuesday, the U.S. official said senior Israeli officials would be briefed by secure phone by top U.S. negotiators on the latest round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Still the Netanyahu speech is likely to further embolden critics in U.S. Congress who fear the U.S. may accept terms too lenient on Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He told Congress Tuesday that the agreement taking shape is dangerous and would allow Iran the ability to develop nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Last week, senators introduced legislation to give Congress a say over any deal, and Republicans are trying to get it passed even as the talks continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The American public appears divided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A new Associated Press-GfK poll shows more than 6 in 10 Americans initially say that they favor Congress instituting new sanctions against Iran, while only 7 percent say they are opposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Another quarter of Americans say they are neither in favor nor opposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the new poll also finds that 31 percent of those who initially said they support new sanctions say that Congress should hold off if the administration says it would reduce the likelihood of a future deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In total, about 4 in 10 Americans think Congress should go forward with sanctions even over the president's protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The poll of 1,045 adults was conducted online Jan. 29-Feb. 2, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Netanyahu offered no alternate negotiating tactic beyond urging the U.S. to walk away from the table, a point Kerry noted Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>If talks are successful, the deal being negotiated will "achieve the goal of proving that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain peaceful."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Kerry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"No one has presented a more viable lasting alternative for how you actually prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The focus of his comments to reporters at the Swiss resort town of Montreux reflected U.S. concerns about the potential damage Netanyahu's speech could have on the negotiations by further empowering powerful Republican opponents in Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Zarif dismissed Netanyahu's claims that Iran is close to developing a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Mr. Netanyahu has been proclaiming, predicting that Iran will have a nuclear weapon within two, three, four years since 1992," he told NBC News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"There may be people who may have been affected by the type of hysteria that is being fanned by people like Mr. Netanyahu, and it is useful for everybody to allow this deal to go through," Zarif said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Kerry planned to meet with Arab Gulf state allies in Riyadh Thursday before sitting down with the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany in Paris on Saturday to share the state of the negotiations.</td></tr>
