<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's Parliament has approved an austerity bill demanded by bailout creditors, despite a significant level of dissent from the governing leftist Syriza party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bill to impose sweeping tax hikes and spending cuts was approved with the support of three pro-European opposition parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Several prominent members of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' ruling party voted against his recommendation, including Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Eurozone rescue lenders demanded the fresh round of cuts in a deal reached this week to place Greece in a new bailout program.</td></tr>
