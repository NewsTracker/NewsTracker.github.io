<h3>FIFA: Blatter resignation won't lead many to quit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Tuesday, June 23, 2009 file photo FIFA president Sepp Blatter gestures as he speaks at the inaugural 'Football for Hope Forum', during the Confederations Cup soccer tournament, at a hotel in Vanderbijlpark, South Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - A consistent ally of Sepp Blatter, Danny Jordaan already has a new job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jordaan, the head of the South African Football Association, was credited with bringing the 2010 World Cup to South Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He is also being investigated for $10 million in bribes paid to land the event, part of the corruption scandal that pushed FIFA President Blatter to resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A day after the corruption and bribery scandal broke last week, Jordaan was appointed the new mayor of his South African hometown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He plans to stay on as the soccer federation's head, a job with no salary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But he's hedging his bets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Call it the domino effect, or a chain reaction, or simply bracing for change coming to FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Blatter is going, so can federation presidents who run world soccer - some like feudal lords in Africa, Asia and Latin America - hang on for long?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Peter Alegi, a historian at Michigan State University and author of "Africa's World Cup," said a 'mild reformer" - not a radical - was likely to succeed Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I do not see much of a chance of a domino effect from Blatter's resignation," he said in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I believe it's more likely that the diverse members of the global football establishment will do whatever it takes to hold on to power, privilege, and prestige."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Former Barcelona and Brazil star Romario hopes not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An outspoken Brazilian federal senator, Romario termed Blatter's downfall "a big wave that can sweep away" bribery and impunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"This is the best news we've had in a long time," Romario said through his social media accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"His fall will come as a tsunami to every corrupt leader in confederations around the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Romario singled out Brazil's authoritarian football leadership, often described as more powerful than the country's president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Former Brazilian Football Confederation president Jose Maria Marin is in a Swiss jail awaiting extradition to the United States, and current president Marco Polo Del Nero is keeping a low profile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Another former president Ricardo Teixeira is under investigation in Brazil for corruption related to bank transfers during preparations for the 2014 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We need the corrupt ones in prison," Romario said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Blatter had automatic support in Brazil, home to his 99-year-old predecessor Joao Havelange and host for last year's World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>His real power came from guaranteeing that tiny Caribbean islands, or countries distant from Europe, receive millions in FIFA development money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>FIFA spent about $1 billion on development projects in the last three years - from Zambia to Andorra - and Blatter got the credit, even if not all the money reached the grassroots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Sad day for Futbol," Zambian Football Association President Kalusha Bwalya said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"You will always have my support."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Ibrahim Sanni Darra, a spokesman for the Ghana Football Association, said Blatter's 17-year reign would be viewed "with nostalgia" and said Africans "will not forget."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Before his tenure, Africa had only two slots in the World Cup," Darra said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"He not only increased it, he also brought the World Cup to Africa."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>New Zealand Football chief executive Andy Martin called Blatter's resignation "a great day for football."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I think we can all get together now and start repairing the tarnished brand of football, and that's what everybody wants."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Wilmar Valdez of Uruguay, a vice president of football's South American governing body CONMEBOL, called Blatter departure a "shock to world football."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Uruguay, Argentina and Chile were among the South American federations that voted against Blatter on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In previous elections, South America was solid Blatter territory.</td></tr>
