<h3>Islamic State Abducts Dozens Of Syrian Christians</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Islamic State militant group has abducted 230 civilians, including at least 60 Christians, after seizing a strategically located town in the central Syrian province of Homs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said the civilians were taken on August 6 in the town of Al-Qaryatain, which IS militants captured late August 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Many of the Christians had fled from Aleppo, in Syria's north, to seek refuge in Al-Qaryatain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said those abducted were wanted by IS for "collaborating with the regime."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Al-Qaryatain had a pre-war population of 18,000, including Sunni Muslims and around 2,000 Syriac Catholics and Orthodox Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the town's Christian population has dropped to only several hundred.</td></tr>
