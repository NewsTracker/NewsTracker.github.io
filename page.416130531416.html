<h3>Gareth Bale to be rested for the Eibar clash, reveals Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ancelotti said he had not made a final decision on who would come into his starting lineup for the game at the Bernabeu, when second-placed Real will look to close the gap on leaders Barcelona, who play at Sevilla later on Saturday, to one point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Asier Illarramendi and Isco will probably play alongside Luka Modric in midfield, with Jese joining Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema up front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'All I can say is that Illarra and Jese have a very good chance of playing,' Ancelotti told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Real at least have Ronaldo available after the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) rescinded a yellow card the Portugal forward was shown in Wednesday's 2-0 win at Rayo Vallecano which would have carried a one-match suspension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ronaldo is the La Liga's top scorer this season with 37 goals, four ahead of Barcelona's Argentina forward Lionel Messi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ancelotti said Ronaldo's Portugal team mate Pepe, a centre back, would be available both for Saturday and Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at Atletico Madrid after a short injury layoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Germany midfielder Sami Khedira and Portugal left back Fabio Coentrao have back and knee problems respectively and will not be in the squad for the Eibar game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The modest Basque club are playing in Spain's top flight for the first time this season but a recent poor run has left them in 14th with eight games left, in danger of dropping straight back down to the second division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'Our thought is only to play a good match and compete, which is a word we use a lot in our dressing-room,' Eibar coach Gaizka Garitano told Marca sports daily in an interview published on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'We are not coming with any fear,' added the 39-year-old, who will be keen to avoid a repeat of the 9-1 thrashing Real dealt Granada at the Bernabeu last weekend.</td></tr>
