<h3>Mexico requires officials to report conflicts of interest</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexico is requiring officials to declare potential conflicts of interest in their private life and financial dealings, a step that President Enrique Pena Nieto had promised after it came to light his wife bought a mansion from a government contractor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The country's anti-corruption watchdog agency will also require officials to say from whom they bought their properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The new rules cover over 200,000 public servants, most of whom were already required to submit lists of their personal property and investments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The rules published Wednesday also require them to reveal any positions in the management of companies, foundations or associations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Officials will also have to reveal any outstanding contracts they have signed that could pose a conflict of interest.</td></tr>
