<h3>Ferguson: suspect arrested in shooting of police officers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clayton, Missouri: A 20-year-old man has been charged with first-degree assault in the shooting of two police officers in front of the Ferguson Police Department prosecuting attorney for St Louis County Robert McCulloch said..</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The man, Jeffrey Williams, acknowledged firing the shots, Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said Mr Williams, who is from north St. Louis County, was inside a car "at least for some of the shots".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jeffrey Williams, 20, is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action in connection with the shooting of two police officers who were keeping watch over a demonstration outside the Ferguson Police Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A handgun was recovered in his residence and matched shell casings found at the scene, according to Mr McCulloch, who said that although Mr Williams appears to be the only shooter, other people may be charged as the investigation continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was possible he was firing shots at someone other than the police but struck the police officers," Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Williams was in custody, Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The suspect was found through information provided by community members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The protests continued in St Louis, Missouri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr McCulloch said Mr Williams indicated that he had a dispute with some people who were in front of the police headquarters, "which had nothing to do with the demonstrations that were going on".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Williams indicated that he was firing at the people he had the dispute with, the prosecutor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He is a demonstrator," Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"He was out there earlier that evening as part of the demonstration. He's been out there on other occasions, part of the demonstrations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Williams was on probation for receiving stolen goods, Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Several protest leaders quickly took to Twitter to say Mr Williams, who is African-American, was not one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>DeRay McKesson, who has been documenting the protests on social media since they started last summer, posted to his account, "No, I cannot recall ever seeing the suspected shooter, Jeffrey Williams, at any protests, including the night in question."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The two officers - one from the county police and the other from the nearby Webster Groves department - were standing shoulder to shoulder as part of a protective line facing demonstrators across the street from the police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At least three gunshots came from a distance behind the demonstrators, the authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A county police officer, 41, suffered a shoulder wound and a colleague, 32, from a nearby police department sustained a facial wound that left a bullet lodged near his ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Both were treated and released by a local hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The shooting ratcheted up tensions that have been simmering here since August 9, when a white police officer, Darren Wilson, fatally shot an unarmed, 18-year-old black man, Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A grand jury declined to indict Mr Wilson in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The shootings took place just hours after Ferguson's police chief resigned in the wake of a scathing US Justice Department report finding his force was rife with racial bias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Chief Tom Jackson's resignation followed the departures of the city manager and a municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The report said the St Louis suburb overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to African-Americans to boost city coffers through fines, used police as a collection agency and created a culture of distrust.</td></tr>

<h3>Clegg keeps a promise! After years of struggling, he has FINALLY quit smoking thanks to high-voltage blueberry vaping</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nick Clegg might suffer from a reputation for struggling to keep promises, but he claims to have made a breakthrough on one long-running ambition: to give up smoking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Deputy Prime Minister has become a convert to 'vaping', in particular using a blueberry flavoured e-cigarette which helps him unwind at home in the evenings, with the occasional glass of Spanish white wine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the most revealing moments of his interview with MailOnline, he discussed how he has learned the hard way not to speak for his wife Miriam, made unconvincing claim to enjoy spending every summer holidaying in the Spanish village where she grew up and explained his battle to keep his children out of the public eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also discussed his worst habits, his wealth and the disgusting chocolate and Twiglets combination he enjoyed as a child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>No matter what his opponents, commentators and the polls keep telling him, the Lib Dem leader remains in a defiantly upbeat mood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As Deputy Prime Minister for the last five years he has toured the world, met the great and the good and been at the heart of an extraordinary experiment in coalition government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the thing he is most pleased to have done is feed a seal in Cornwall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'It was brilliant,' he says with schoolboyish enthusiasm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He sent a picture of his moment with the seal to his children, his parents, his whole family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His baffled sister asked: 'Why is this the only picture you've emailed me of yourself in the last several months".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>I recommend the blueberry vape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It is unusual to find such an upbeat outlook in someone trying to quit smoking, but he insists - not for the first time - that he might just have managed to kick the habit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 2011 Mr Clegg revealed he had gone 'cold turkey' to give up smoking, but it did not work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Two years later he declared he was 'off the ciggies', but admitted it might not last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But now there may have been a breakthrough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'It has taken a significant step in the right direction,' he declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'At the moment, at least for the last several weeks, I am off the fags and on the vapes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I've got some hilariously termed multi-voltage thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'I haven't smoked a cigarette in weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>I'm not 100 per cent sure what the effect on my health is of these new battery powered things,' he laughs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'You can put all different flavours in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>I have tried the blueberry, it's good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Reclining on a large cream sofa in his office over-looking Horse Guard's Parade, he claims never to have used his e-cigarette at work, but it does mean he is no longer banished to the garden when he needs a nicotine fix at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'I now don't need to cower in the rain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>I only ever smoke very little, only in the evenings when the kids have gone to bed and all the rest of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>I've learned the hard way not to speak for Miriam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mindful of his reputation for broken promises, he is not yet ready to say that he has kicked the habit for good: 'I'm not going to over claim and under deliver on this particular instance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In a week when Ed Miliband turned to his wife Justine to bolster his flagging poll ratings, there is growing expectation that Miriam will step out in support of Mr Clegg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>She may well hit the campaign trail at some point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He is just waiting to be told.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>'I've learned the hard way not to speak for Miriam,' he says, with a cautious laugh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'She will speak for herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Mr Clegg said he hopes wife Miriam will join him on the campaign trail at some point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>As Labour gears up to deploy Mrs Miliband as the Labour leader's secret weapon, Mr Clegg hopes his wife 'will hopefully help out a bit' in the election campaign, while juggling the pressures of her job as a City lawyer and raising their three sons Alberto, Antonio and Miguel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>'One thing I can tell you, both Miriam and I will always be vigilant about trying to keep the kids out of the public eye, he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He insists it is not meant as an 'oblique criticism' of the Milibands, who had their sons Sam and Daniel pose for the cameras this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>'But we have been very adamant right from the outset that we are not going to have our I will talk with unbridled pride about my children, and very happily do that like any proud dad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>It is difficult to get further from the public eye than the small town of Olmedo where every year the Cleggs take their summer holiday, with Miriam's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Surely he must tire of the same break in the middle of nowhere?</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>'You have no idea what a dangerous question this is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Nervous laughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>'I absolutely love it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>I love I no I really do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Where my in-laws live really is kind of in the middle of nowhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>'I've been going there for over 20 years or so now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>It's completely off the tourist trail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>But is it fun?</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>'Well it I love it because it' I love it it's a complete change of gear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The kids play football with the other kids in the village and I play tennis my brother-in-law with some folk who live in the village.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>MailOnline readers were blunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Sandy Brown, London: 'Mr Clegg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>When you leave office in May where will you go.</td></tr>
