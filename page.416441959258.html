<h3>Drug cartel violence flares again in Northern Mexico state</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Drug cartel violence in Mexico's Tamaulipas state flared up for the second time in a week on Wednesday, with gun battles and arson attacks erupting in the street after police captured four alleged drug gang members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The detainees, whose identity is still unknown, are from the Gulf Cartel, one of Mexico's oldest drug trafficking groups, also known for kidnappings and immigrant trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We had blockades in the town of Altamira. They [organized crime groups] are trying to intimidate the government," a state government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The official said it was not yet clear whether the two people killed were trying to rescue the detainees or just caught in the crossfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earlier in April, parts of Reynosa, a city across the Rio Grande from McAllen, Texas, ground to a halt after gunfights broke out and vehicles were set ablaze the same day authorities caught Gulf Cartel leader known as "El Gafe" there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>More than 100,000 people have died in gang-related violence in Mexico over the past eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>President Enrique Pena Nieto pledged to restore order when he took office in 2012, but although the homicide count has fallen, parts of the country remain mired in violence.</td></tr>
