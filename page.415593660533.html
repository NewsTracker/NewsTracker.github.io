<h3>5 key findings from AP's story on WHO and the Ebola outbreak</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But an investigation by The Associated Press has revealed the U.N. health agency knew from the start how unusual the outbreak was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WHO officials privately floated the idea of declaring an international health emergency in early June, more than a month before the agency maintains it got its first sign the outbreak merited one " in late July " and two months before the declaration was finally made on August 8, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>WHO blamed its slow response partly on a lack of real-time information and the surprising characteristics of the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In fact it had accurate field reports " including scientists asking for backup " and it identified the unprecedented features of the outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The agency was also hobbled by a shortage of funds and a lack of clear leadership over its country and regional offices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Politics appear to have clouded WHO's willingness to declare an international emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Internal emails and documents suggest the U.N. health agency was afraid of provoking conflict with the Ebola-stricken countries and wary that a declaration could interfere with the economy and the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An Ebola-infected WHO consultant in Sierra Leone violated WHO health protocols, creating a rift with Doctors Without Borders that was only resolved when WHO was thrown out of a shared hotel.</td></tr>

<h3>Lena Dunham Causes Chaos on ?Scandal? With Kinky Tell-All Book</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sue seemed innocent enough at first and was starstruck to find Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) on her doorstep, who asked the new author: "These men in your book - did they violate you? Do anything unwanted, force you, humiliate you? Then what right do you have to publicly violate them?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While Sue claimed she used code names for the many, many men she had slept with, Pope said: "The press will decode those names in a matter of hours."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"That book is a problem - make that book disappear from the planet, or you will be the problem," she threatened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sue soon showed a different side of her personality when she demanded payment for the book - and all her sexual shenanigans with the government's highest-ranking officials - to disappear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I want $3 million from whoever hired you," she said, while asking Olivia "when she got so weak?" and calling her a "dried up prude."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And so begins the hunt for all the men, which included Leo Bergen and David Rosen, that Sue slept with after meeting them on an X-rated dating website, and the appeal for them to donate to the hush money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Olivia and her team then dug a little deeper and found out that Sue had been fired from her job for not sleeping with her boss after he sexually harassed her, so he became the target of their wrath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dunham was a huge hit among both "Scandal" fans and the cast for her quirky portrayal of the young woman who was described as "smart and nice & but deeply perverted."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, don't expect her to repeat the guest-starring role - as her Instagram post on Thursday revealed there was no coming back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Read more tweets from Dunham and the "Scandal" cast below.</td></tr>
