<h3>Artists Snuck a Giant Bust of Edward Snowden on Top of a Brooklyn War Monument</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Early Monday morning, several artists placed a giant bust of NSA leaker Edward Snowden on a war monument in Fort Greene Park, according to Animal New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 100-pound, four-foot-tall statue sits atop a Revolutionary War tribute called the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument, and it was installed by anonymous artists who want to "bring a renewed vitality to the space and prompt even more visitors to ponder the sacrifices made for their freedoms."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>We have updated this monument to highlight those who sacrifice their safety in the fight against modern-day tyrannies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It would be a dishonor to those memorialized here to not laud those who protect the ideals they fought for, as Edward Snowden has by bringing the NSA's 4th-Amendment-violating surveillance programs to light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>All too often, figures who strive to uphold these ideals have been cast as criminals rather than in bronze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Unfortunately for the artists, it looks like the modern-day tyranny of the NYC parks department has already removed the statue.</td></tr>
