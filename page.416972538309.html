<h3>Ferguson shooting's witness freed on reduced bond</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A key witness in the Michael Brown shooting death was freed Wednesday on reduced bond linked to charges that he resisted arrest during a confrontation last week with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dorian Johnson's payment of the required $100 to cover the $1,000 bond came just hours after a St. Louis judge reduced the bond from one that required Johnson to come up with $1,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Online court records earlier Wednesday showed that a judge on Monday had denied Johnson's request to lower his bond, but one of his attorneys, Ryan Smith, and a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office said that was erroneous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While Johnson's attorneys had filed a motion to have the bond pared, that matter wasn't discussed in court until Wednesday, when city prosecutors did not object to the lesser amount.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The state usually objects when it believes there's a public safety issue" involving a certain defendant's release on bond, said Susan Ryan, a spokeswoman for the city circuit attorney's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In this case, there's no reason to believe there's a public safety issue" with Johnson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ryan Smith, a Johnson attorney, declined to discuss Johnson's case later Wednesday with The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prosecutors on May 7 charged Johnson, 23, with resisting arrest or interfering with a lawful stop or detention, a misdemeanor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That criminal complaint accuses Johnson of trying to hinder the previous day's arrest of his younger brother, 21-year-old Demonte Johnson, "by using or threatening the use of violence, physical force or physical interference."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dorian Johnson was a prominent witness to the shooting death last August of Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old who was killed by white Ferguson officer Darren Wilson during a confrontation in a street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Brown's death led to sometimes-violent protests in Ferguson and other U.S. cities, spawning a national "Black Lives Matter" movement seeking changes in how police deal with minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to charge Wilson, who later resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the Justice Department released a scathing report that cited racial bias and racial profiling in Ferguson policing and in a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targeted blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dorian Johnson's arrest came exactly a week after he sued Ferguson, Wilson and the city's former police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Demonte Johnson, who was charged last week with resisting arrest and a misdemeanor count of assault on a law enforcement officer, was freed Monday after posting $1,000 cash bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His next court appearance is scheduled for May 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A message seeking comment also was left Wednesday with Demonte Johnson's attorney, John Washington.</td></tr>
