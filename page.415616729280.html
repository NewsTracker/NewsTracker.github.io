<h3>LeBron shakes off cold, scores 29 as Cavs edge Pacers 95-92 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>James scored 29 points - 13 in the fourth quarter- and Cleveland edged the Indiana Pacers 95-92 on Friday night for its 15th straight win at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As usual, James, who was feeling so ill that he stayed behind in the locker room at halftime, was at his best down the stretch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He scored 11 straight points in the fourth to give Cleveland a 93-92 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, it was Cavs guard Iman Shumpert who came up with the biggest play, running down a long rebound and knocking down two free throws with a second left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>With the win, the Cavs clinched a playoff spot - their first since 2010 before James left as a free agent for Miami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It feels amazing,'' said All-Star guard Kyrie Irving, who will take part in an NBA postseason for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''It's an awesome thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>James was so sick that he skipped the Cavs' morning shootaround so he could get some extra sleep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But while resting at home, he was late to see his youngest son, Bryce, read in front of his school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fortunately, James made it to the play - ''I had to be there'' - and the Cavs were thrilled the four-time MVP dressed against the Pacers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''LeBron does a lot of great things,'' Cleveland coach David Blatt said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''One of those things is he came to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was sick and certainly could have made an excuse but did not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After Shumpert's free throws, Indiana had one last chance, but C.J. Miles' desperation 3-pointer was way off and Cleveland held on to win a game that had a playoff vibe from the start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''Any time you play Indiana it's like that,'' said James, who has faced the Pacers many times in the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Irving added 13 points for Cleveland and Kevin Love had 13 rebounds and scrapped underneath for a key rebound in the final minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Cavs are a league-best 26-6 since Jan. 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>George Hill scored 24 points and Roy Hibbert had 20 for the Pacers, who dropped their fourth straight and damaged their playoff hopes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Indiana had chances, but down the stretch the Pacers couldn't stop James.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''We just got undone by one of the best players in the league,'' coach Frank Vogel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Reserve guard Matthew Dellavedova gave Cleveland a huge lift, hitting three 3-pointers - two on consecutive possessions early in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But it was James, arguably the NBA's best closer, who put the Pacers away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He scored nine consecutive points, the last two on a driving layup he accentuated with a scissor kick, to give the Cavaliers a 91-89 lead with 2:40 remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Miles drained a long 3 to put the Pacers up one, but James delivered again with an off-balance runner in the lane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Cavaliers have much loftier goals than making the playoffs, but James acknowledged just getting in was a big step for a team not accustomed to winning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''It's a huge accomplishment for our team,'' he said, looking around the room at the lockers of Irving, Love and Tristan Thompson, none of whom have played in the postseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''For me, I don't look too far into it, but for guys who have never been in the postseason, they shouldn't take that for granted and overlook that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>While the Cavs had James, the Pacers were still without All-Star guard Paul George, who could be eyeing a return from a broken right leg sustained last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A team official said George will update his status on Monday following the team's shootaround.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Vogel was adamant that George will not play Saturday when the Pacers host Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Pacers: David West played 12 minutes before leaving with an undisclosed illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>... With his team scrapping for a playoff spot, Vogel was asked if he keeps an eye on the NBA standings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''Too much,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''I do look at it - probably more than I should.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Cavaliers: J.R. Smith came in shooting 50 percent (20 of 40) in his last five games on 3-pointers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>... The Cavs won't play at home again until March 29 as Quicken Loans Arena hosts the NCAA Midwest Regional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>... The Cavs are 38-3 when leading or tied entering the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Pacers: Host Brooklyn on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Cavaliers: At Milwaukee on Sunday.</td></tr>
