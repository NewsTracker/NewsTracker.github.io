<h3>Tamir Rice case: Cleveland mayor apologises after city claims 12-year-old to blame for his own police shooting death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The video, though silent and impersonal, remains chilling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On a cold autumn morning in Cleveland a boy ambles around a bandstand in a park playing with a pellet gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Suddenly a police car appears, and without even leaving the driver's seat an officer shoots the boy, 12-year-old Tamir Rice in the stomach and torso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tamir Rice was shot and killed after a caller reported he was pointing a gun at people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Other details of this killing, ones not clear on the security camera footage, are even more horrific.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As Tamir lay dying his 14-year-old sister who had been playing nearby, and who ran to his aid, was thrown to the ground police, cuffed, then locked in the police car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Then she watched as her brother kicked and died in the snow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The officers rendered no aid for four minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It somehow compounds the tragedy to know that the police had been called to the scene by a man who is also visible on the footage - sitting in the bandstand - who must have known that the boy posed no threat, yet who nonetheless called and reported male with a pistol that was "probably fake".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Twice he was asked if the subject of his report was black or white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And to know that the officer who pulled the trigger, Timothy Loehmann, had been forced out of a nearby local police department for being unable to follow "basic functions as instructed" and for his "dismal failure" in weapons handling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Killed: 12-year-old Tamir Rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Last November's shooting shattered the Rice family and added to the intensity of nation-wide protests over winter against police killings of unarmed African-Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Now the city of Cleveland's response to a federal lawsuit bought against it by the Rice family has reopened the unhealed wounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>According to the city's lawyers, the shooting was "directly and proximately caused by [Tamir and his family's] own acts. . .," and added that Tamir caused his own death "by the failure. . . to exercise due care to avoid injury."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Rice family is appalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"What they said is incredulous [sic] at best. It's unbelievable," said Walter Madison, one of the Rice family's attorneys, during an interview with The Washington Post on Monday in which he said the city's response was further evidence of police arrogance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There are a number of things that we in society don't allow 12-year-olds to do. We don't allow them to vote, we don't allow them to drink. In court we don't try them as adults. They don't have the capacity to understand the consequences of their actions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Later on Monday Cleveland's mayor Frank Jackson called press conference to apologise to the Rice family and to Cleveland's residents, "for our poor use of words and our insensitivity" in the filing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"In an attempt to protect all of our defences, we used words and we phrased things in such a way that was very insensitive," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The document was "very insensitive to tragedy in general, the family and the victim in particular," and would be amended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The response comes as the federal Justice Department nears completion of an investigation into allegedly discriminatory behaviour by the Ferguson Police Department, which has been the subject of protests since the shooting of Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Officials who have been briefed on the report have told the New York Times that it will criticise the department for disproportionately ticketing and arresting African-Americans and using the proceeds of the fines to balance the city's budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The practice created years of racial animosity leading up to the shooting and the subsequent protests and riots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The report charts the frustration of the African-American community that the police department remains overwhelmingly white in a predominantly African-American community.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>Lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, Leonard Arpan, said after the hearing they would have to wait until Wednesday to see what evidence their team would bring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Actually their response is not apples to apples with ours," he said, meaning the state hadn't countered all of the issues in the appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Arpan would not discuss what further legal appeals may be planned for the Australians, who are already incarcerated on the island where Indonesia plans to execute them for their role in a 2005 drug smuggling plot.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>The executions would take place on Nusakambangan island, Central Java, where Chan and Sukumaran are now jailed in quarantine cells.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>"I learn a great deal about this case through the Indonesian media," she told ABC radio on Wednesday, referring to reports the execution might be delayed by up to three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Some Liberal MPs reportedly are concerned about the government's focus on the Bali Nine members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>West Australian MP Luke Simpkins raised the issue during a party-room meeting on Tuesday, according to the ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He suggested the government had "exhausted all avenues" and needed to shift focus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have visited the death-row prisoners on Indonesia's Nusakamgangan prison and will now have to wait until Monday before they can see them again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are awaiting Jakarta's next move after another death row convict was granted an appeal that will take months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso has been granted a judicial review, which typically takes three months and could ensure the Bali Nine pair avoid the firing squad for months, as Jakarta has indicated it prefers to wait for all legal appeals to be heard before killing 10 drug convicts.</td></tr>

<tr><td>37</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's families and friends will visit today before several head home to Sydney because of the delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The pair's lawyers meanwhile are preparing for an appeal in Jakarta administrative court tomorrow against the denial of clemency.</td></tr>

<tr><td>52</td><td>"The objection is to the manner and tone of the intervention, the warnings and the thinly veiled threats. These are unacceptable. Indonesia does not employ these tactics in its own intervention," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>But Foreign Minister Julie Bishop rejects the allegation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>She said Australia is making its plea for clemency in "the most respectful way possible".</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"We oppose the death penalty at home and abroad and we oppose Indonesia carrying out the death penalty on Australian citizens, that's why we have v respectfully requested President Widodo reconsider the clemency pleas of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan."</td></tr>

<tr><td>64</td><td>The Pekanbaru District Court confirmed the granting of clemency, The Jakarta Post reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The move comes as lawyers for Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran continue to bargain for their lives of the convicted drug smugglers.</td></tr>
