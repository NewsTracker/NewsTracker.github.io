<h3>Google plans to equip automated cars with external airbags</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Airbags are usually located inside cars, but Google wants to change that on its driverless cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google acquired a new patent that illustrates the idea of equipping automated cars with external airbags to protect nearby pedestrians in case of an accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The patent, which is called "System for pedestrian leg protection in vehicle impact," shows several illustrations in which the air bags are located on the front bumper of the automated car and it extends from side to side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The bumper airbags would deploy upon impact and create a buffer for pedestrians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"A system for protecting a pedestrian during impact with a vehicle, the system having a bumper adapted for attachment to an end of the vehicle, wherein the bumper is comprised of a plurality of air sacs," reads the patent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The plurality of air sacs stretch and then burst during impact between the bumper and a pedestrian wherein the bursting of some of the plurality of air sacs reduces spring back of the bumper on the pedestrian."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Google's driverless cars are meant to reduce car accidents and so far the cars have only been in two recorded accidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The first was a read-end incident and the other was an accident that occurred while somebody was driving the car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Google wants to make sure its cars include as many safety features possible since automated cars make a lot of people nervous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google is not the only company working on external airbags.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Volvo has also been working on equipping its cars with pedestrian-sensing airbags.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's still unclear whether these bumpers will be installed on automated cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Google has yet to comment on the patent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Five Chelsea fans will contest the implementation of football banning orders for their suspected involvement in a racist incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>NBA legend and hoops yakker Charles Barkley made a mistake Sunday as he continues to sleepwalk through the NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Reports that embattled President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.had come hours after rebels seized a nearby airbase.</td></tr>
