<h3>Aust not implementing a Google tax: Hockey</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Treasurer Joe Hockey says he is not about to impose a new tax to combat profit-shifting by multinational companies but he is looking to tighten taxation rules with the help from the British government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Hockey and British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne agreed at last week's G20 meeting in Washington to set up a working group after the British election to tackle tax avoidance by big global companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Australia is looking to learn from the UK's experience of introducing a diverted profits tax at the beginning of April, commonly known as the "Google tax".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, Mr Hockey won't be copying the initiative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Australia does not need to impose a new tax but certainly there are ways we can beef up the integrity measures around our own taxation system," Mr Hockey told ABC television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He does not believe this will divert attention away from the efforts of the OECD through the G20 under its base erosion and profit shifting plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"By the United Kingdom and Australia coming together on this initiative, we are going to lead the world and work with the OECD and the G20 to ensure that companies pay the proper amount of tax where they earn the income," he said.</td></tr>
