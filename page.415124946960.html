<h3>Thousands march in Russia to mourn Putin critic Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Holding placards declaring "I am not afraid", thousands of Russians marched in Moscow on Sunday in memory of Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov, whose slaying on the streets of the capital has shaken Russia's beleaguered opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One organizer said that more than 70,000 people turned out in central Moscow on Sunday, many carrying Russian flags and slowly marching through an avenue alongside the River Moskva.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police estimated the crowd at more than 16,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Associated Press reported 30,000 attended the march.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russian investigators say they are pursuing several lines of inquiry, including the possibility that Nemtsov, 55, was killed by Muslim attackers or that the opposition killed him to blacken the president's name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Putin's opponents say such suggestions show the cynicism of Russia's leaders as they whip up nationalism, hatred and anti-Western hysteria to rally support for his policies on Ukraine and deflect blame for an economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It is a blow to Russia. If political views are punished this way, then this country simply has no future," Sergei Mitrokhin, an opposition leader, said of Nemtsov's murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Another mourning march was held earlier Sunday in St. Petersburg, drawing several thousand people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Putin has described the killing as a "provocation," and told Nemtsov's 86-year-old mother, Dina Eidman, that the killers would be found and punished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He also promised to do everything possible to bring to justice those responsible for Nemtsov's killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Everything will be done so that the organisers and perpetrators of a vile and cynical murder get the punishment they deserve," Putin said in a telegram to Nemtsov's mother published on the Kremlin's website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said Nemtsov's death was an irreparable loss and that he had "left his trace in Russia's history, in politics and public life".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nemtsov was one of the leading lights of an opposition struggling to revive its fortunes three years after mass rallies against Putin failed to prevent him from returning to the presidency after four years as prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Putin has been Russia's dominant leader since 2000, when ailing President Boris Yeltsin chose the former KGB spy as his successor, a role Nemtsov had once been destined to play.</td></tr>

<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu says he 'respects' Obama on eve of US trip</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Wearing a black skullcap, he rested his hands on the Wall on Saturday while praying briefly, before he made remarks expressing his respect for US President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This is amid tensions with the White House caused by his acceptance of an invitation by Republicans to speak on Tuesday at Capitol Hill, as Netanyahu stands firm on his bid to persuade Congress to fight Obama's Iran plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wearing a black skullcap, he rested his hands on the Wall (above) while praying briefly, before he expressed his respect for US President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'I want to take this opportunity to say that I respect US President Barack Obama,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'I believe in the strength of the relations between Israel and the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Netanyahu's visit to the Western Wall is his first to the sacred site before a US trip since he became prime minister for the second time in 2009, according to The Jerusalem Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was followed by a visit to his father's grave two days prior.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Prime Minister said his father, Benzion, who passed away in 2012 and often gave him advice during crucial moments in his life, told him to 'always look at the threats endangering our people'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Netanyahu reiterated that in his position as prime minister, it is his job to be concerned about Israel's security, and to also identify dangers in time and do whatever possible to try to stop them from occurring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Netanyahu said: 'As prime minister of Israel it is my duty to care for the security of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Prime Minister referred to previous leaders, David Ben-Gurion, Levi Eshkol, and Menachem Begin, who he said all took action when they believed it to be necessary, even though they went against strongly-stated US policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His planned speech has caused 34 Democrats (30 House Members and four Senators), including Vice President Joe Biden, to boycott his speech during the joint session of Congress next week, according to CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But even a Republican is planning to miss the speech as US Representative Jan Schakowsky released a statement on Thursday and said she will also not be in attendance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Schakowsky, the only Jewish member of Illinois' Congressional delegation, said she agrees with the criticism of Republican House Speaker John Boehner's decision to invite Netanyahu without consulting Obama, according to The Chicago Tribune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She also reportedly said she is more concerned about his speech scuttling negotiations with Iran to stop it from building a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And earlier this week, National Security Adviser Susan Rice came out saying the Prime Minister's decision to give the speech 'was destructive to the fabric of the relationship' between the US and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Netanyahu is set to give his speech on Tuesday at 11am, which will be followed by lunch with a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders before he returns to Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Secretary of State John Kerry will leave at the weekend for Switzerland for another meeting with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The pace and intensity of the talks have increased as global powers gathered under the P5+1, a group of six world leaders, have sought a deal with Iran to stop it acquiring a nuclear weapon - something Tehran denies trying to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A March 31 deadline for a political framework for the deal is looming, with negotiators saying they will aim to pin down the final technical details by June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Israel believes the sides are likely to reach an agreement that eases international sanctions on the Islamic republic without applying sufficiently stringent safeguards to stop it developing nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>During his US visit, the Prime Minister, who arrives on Sunday accompanied with his wife and top advisers, will also give a speech at American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Netanyahu's trip to Washington comes two weeks before Israel's March 17 general election in which he is seeking a third consecutive term in office.</td></tr>
