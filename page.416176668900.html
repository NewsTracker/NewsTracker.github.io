<tr><td>67</td><td>She said she used a private domain out of "convenience" but admitted in retrospect "it would have been better" to use multiple emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>That's the blessing and the curse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Hillary Clinton does not start her campaign at the starting line, like most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>She's a woman who has written two autobiographies - one called "Living History"- and has a resume that checks almost every box, except the one she wants to check this time around: Madame President.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>She's been through it all, and then some.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>So it's easy to ask why she would actually do this: another campaign, more targets on her back, the possibility it won't succeed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>But the tugs at Hillary Clinton to run are much stronger, as it turns out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>The tug of the huge Clinton network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>The tug of her husband, Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>The tug of history as a woman, to be sure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>And the tug of national service which, many point out, is what Hillary knows best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>"It's not just 'I have to do this, I have to make history, I have to be the big shot, they have to play Hail to the Chief when I walk in the room,'" says friend, adviser and fundraiser Paul Begala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>"It's really a sense that she's got this agenda and this is the way to get it done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>California Sen. Diane Feinstein (D), who has known her for decades, puts it this way: "She doesn't 'need' it. But she wants it. She's put a lifetime of herself in a way in preparation for it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>So it's a decision that surprises absolutely no one - despite the fact everyone understands it's not an easy undertaking - especially for a Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>But, as McAuliffe says, she's been through some very dark days at the White House once before-and managed to survive, and even thrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>"It was tough," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>"This was about their family and she wanted to keep it about their family... You know when tough times come, she's able to deal with it, deal with it herself and is able to continue to move on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Indeed, adds former Commerce Secretary and White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, "I don't know what they could say about her that hasn't been said about her in the past in a negative sense. So, you know, she's got a pretty strong shield around her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>It's a shield that can keep the voters at arm's length, and that's what worries the campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>They understand that, after all these years in the public eye, there's still something elusive about Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>"People who've never met either of them, [have a] very clear sense of who Bill Clinton is... They love him, they call him Bill. It's like 'yeah do you think he would like come and, you know, have a barbeque with us?' With Hillary there is a distance," Begala said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>The consigliere - John Podesta, one of the top liberal minds in politics, will serve as Clinton's campaign chairman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>A former White House chief of staff for Bill Clinton and a top counselor for President Obama, Podesta has the stature to speak truth to power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>His influential role in early structural and strategic decisions suggests that he will be a far more hands-on campaign chairman than most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>The manager - Robby Mook impressed Clinton-land when he ran Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign to primary wins in Nevada, Ohio and Indiana, and again when he led Terry McAuliffe - a longtime Clinton friend and confidant - to the Virginia governor's mansion in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>The numbers-focused, Vermont-native has had his hand in hiring many of top campaign strategists this time around and is pushing Clinton's sharp focus on Iowa and New Hampshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>The strategist - Joel Benenson started to work with Clinton in 2014, when the former secretary of state was mulling a run and piecing a staff together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>The lead pollster for President Obama's winning campaign and re-election, who also worked on Bill Clinton's 1996 race, will be the top campaign strategist for Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>His firm is already starting to test themes and messages for this campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>The adman - Jim Margolis also once worked to defeat Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Now, he is working with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Margolis was a senior adviser to both President Barack Obama's successful campaigns and has worked with a number of senators, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>Margolis will server as Clinton's top media adviser and ad maker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>The right-hand man - Marlon Marshall has long been Robby Mook's trusted right-hand man and is seen as a talented organizer and field director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>He knows what went right -- and wrong -- during Hillary Clinton's first presidential race because he was there and will be in charge of making adjustments this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>He helped found the Democratic consulting firm 270 Strategies and during a stint at the White House was tasked with promoting Obamacare enrollment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>The fundraiser - While Hillary Clinton mulled her presidential run, Dennis Cheng pulled double duty for a short time: Working as the chief development officer at The Clinton Foundation and starting to build a 2016 fundraising team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>Cheng, who is credited with raising more than $248 million for the foundation since 2011, will fill the campaign's top finance post and take on the daunting task of fortifying what is expected to be a billion-dollar campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>The gate-keeper - Huma Abedin has worn many hats for Hillary Clinton - intern, "body woman," chief of staff - but the title that best describes her is gate keeper and confidant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>No one without the last name Clinton is said to have a tighter relationship with the former secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>Although her formal title in the 2016 campaign is not yet clear, she remains one of Clinton's most trusted personal aides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>The wonk - As the campaign's top policy adviser, Jake Sullivan will look to navigate Clinton's campaign through complex issues, particularly on foreign policy matters like Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>In 2011, Sullivan became the youngest director of policy in department history, an experience that earned him Clinton's implicit respect and trust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>The protector- Cheryl Mills is one of Hillary Clinton's closest, longest confidants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>She was a top lawyer in the Clinton White House and served as Hillary Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>She also is a member of the Clinton Foundation board of directors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>While Mills isn't expected to hold a formal campaign role, she will continue to have something more important: Hillary Clinton's ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>The enforcer - Most journalists in Washington can remember the last time they got a nasty-gram from Philippe Reines and a simple Google search will lead you to a handful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>The veteran of Capitol Hill and Clinton's senior adviser at State has been a part of Clinton's communication team for years and is expected to play a role in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>This time, however, it will be from the outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>The communicator - Jennifer Palmieri has a deep history with Democratic presidential elections and will serve as the campaign's communications director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>A member of the team's senior staff, Palmieri is known for her cordial and direct relations with the press, dating back to her time in the first Clinton White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>She last served as President Obama's communications director, but left the White House in March to join the Clinton campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>The image maven - The job of retooling Hillary Clinton's image will fall primarily to Kristina Schake, a communications veteran whose background includes working for issue campaigns, multinational corporations and Hollywood stars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>As Michelle Obama's communications director, Schake was credited with helping to turn the first lady into an everywoman known for dancing on national TV and touring colleges with her daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>The brain - Neera Tanden is currently the head of the Center for American Progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>She's worked with Clinton since 1997, serving as a deputy campaign manager in the 2000 Senate campaign, her policy director in the Senate and during the 2008 presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>The two regularly talk and because CAP is a pro-Clinton research body, Tanden will continue to wield influence inside and outside the campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>The institutionalist - Of all the people working on Clinton's 2016 campaign, Mandy Grunwald may know the Clintons the longest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>Grunwald first worked for the Clintons in 1992, when she served as director of advertising on Bill Clinton's presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>Grunwald has grown closer with Hillary Clinton through the years and guided her advertising on the 2008 campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>129</td><td>This time, she will be one of the top strategists to shape her message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>130</td><td>The politico - Amanda Renteria, who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2014 in Calfornia, will serve as Clinton's national political director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>131</td><td>She was the first Latina chief of staff on Capitol Hill when she worked for Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>132</td><td>The techie - Stephanie Hannon left Google and her role as the company's director of product management for civic innovation and social impact to join the Clinton campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>133</td><td>Hannon will oversee the implementation of Clinton's digital strategy, including both the strategic plans and technical side of building a website, apps and other web platforms for the campaign, most of which fell short to the Obama organization eight years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>134</td><td>So the game plan is to have the voters meet the "real Hillary" -- the warm one, virtually one-on-one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>135</td><td>That way, the theory goes, the voters will be able to meet the Hillary her friends describe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>136</td><td>She is, says McAuliffe, a "tremendous amount of fun.... She's got a great belly laugh. She and I will sit out, you know, on vacation, talking policy. Might have a cocktail or two, you know, I mean she's a load of fun to be with."</td></tr>
<tr><td>137</td><td>In the end, adds Feinstein, "I think she's a very complete person."</td></tr>
<tr><td>138</td><td>But what really counts, she adds, is the years she has put in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>139</td><td>"I think the most important thing is what her experience has given her. You know, we have men who come here for one or two years, get a few puff pieces and they go out and they run for president."</td></tr>
<tr><td>140</td><td>Take that Paul, Rubio and Cruz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>141</td><td>Hillary Clinton's story is long, and controversial and with it comes baggage, which she is also trying to shed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>142</td><td>She encountered trouble from her time at the State Department during the email controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>143</td><td>There are lingering descriptions of the Clintons as paranoid, too protected, even arrogant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>144</td><td>"I think the misconceptions, there are certain people that are fixed in those with those beliefs, and been in those for twenty-five years," says Bill Daley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>145</td><td>"You're not going to change them.... What you've got to do is basically talk to the future about what you want to with the country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>146</td><td>That seems to be the plan - and it is very different from her past unsuccessful attempt at winning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>147</td><td>In 2008, Clinton ran on her past experience, and let the "woman thing" take a backseat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>148</td><td>"I do think the last time she ran they tried very hard to keep it a secret," says Begala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>149</td><td>"But she is a girl."</td></tr>
<tr><td>150</td><td>And this time, the Democrats have decided they're (mostly) all in-practically parting the waters for her to run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>151</td><td>It's contrary to Democratic Party culture and practice, which normally all-but-disinherits a presidential candidate that has lost once before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>152</td><td>Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson on March 2 announced the launch of an exploratory committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>153</td><td>South Carolina's Lindsey Graham has said he'll make a decision surrounding a presidential run sometime soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>154</td><td>A potential bid could focus on Graham's foreign policy stance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>155</td><td>Hillary Clinton continues to have an overwhelming lead over other possible 2016 Democratic presidential candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>She is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>157</td><td>Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is considered a possible Republican candidate, but he told CNN that his priority is to first help the GOP capture the Senate in next November's midterms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>158</td><td>Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican rising star from Florida, was swept into office in 2010 on the back of tea party fervor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>159</td><td>But his support of comprehensive immigration reform, which passed the Senate but has stalled in the House, has led some in his party to sour on his prospects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>160</td><td>Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has said his decision to run for the Republican nomination will be based on two things -- his family and whether he can lift America's spirit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>161</td><td>His father and brother formerly served as President.</td></tr>
<tr><td>162</td><td>Lincoln Chafee, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat former governor and senator of Rhode Island, announced a presidential exploratory committee as a Democrat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>163</td><td>Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said recently it's too early to announce whether he'll run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>164</td><td>Jindal has said he wants to focus on "winning the war of ideas" before making a decision on his presidential ambitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>165</td><td>Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee member Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asserts an objection to Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a Democratic sponsor of the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline bill, as the committee met to advance the controversial project, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2015, on Capitol Hill in Washington.</td></tr>

<tr><td>170</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>

<tr><td>172</td><td>Sen. Rand Paul officially announced his presidential bid on April 7 at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>173</td><td>The tea party favorite likely will have to address previous controversies that include comments on civil rights, a plagiarism allegation and his assertion the top NSA official lied to Congress about surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>174</td><td>Texas Sen. Ted Cruz plans to travel to states that factor into the early nomination process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>175</td><td>The first-term Republican and tea party darling is considered a gifted orator and smart politician.</td></tr>
<tr><td>176</td><td>He is best known in the Senate for his marathon filibuster over defunding Obamacare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>177</td><td>Maryland Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley released a "buzzy" political video in November 2013 in tandem with visits to New Hampshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>178</td><td>He also headlined a Democratic Party event in South Carolina, which holds the first southern primary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>179</td><td>Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced in 2013 that he would not be seeking re-election, leading to speculation he might mount a second White House bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>180</td><td>Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, a social conservative, gave Mitt Romney his toughest challenge in the nomination fight last time out and has made trips recently to early voting states, including Iowa and South Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>181</td><td>Political observers expect New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to yield to Hillary Clinton should she run in 2016, fearing there wouldn't be room in the race for two Democrats from the Empire State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>182</td><td>Should she not jump in, Cuomo would then be a potential candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>183</td><td>"That's what's weird," says Begala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>184</td><td>"The Democratic party, when you lose, you're out. You go to like Eastern Massachusetts Tech and teach. And we never want to see you again. This is what's so different, is that she has run and come up short, and yet they love her. She's been on the scene for decades, and we (usually) want new, and yet they love her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>185</td><td>"This is a well-tested, well-proven, well-known and well-liked [candidate]," adds Bill Daley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>186</td><td>"It's not as though you're trying to shove something down the mouths of the Democratic Party."</td></tr>
<tr><td>187</td><td>Indeed, among Democrats, Clinton starts out with an 86 percent approval rating, according to the latest CNN/ORC poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>188</td><td>"So, if you were thinking about challenging that, why would you do that? Who's the genius that would go out and do that?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>189</td><td>And here's a key reason why: history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>190</td><td>Democrats do not need any reminding that Hillary Clinton could become the nation's first female commander-in-chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>191</td><td>And neither does she.</td></tr>
<tr><td>192</td><td>"I think she knows she carries the cause," says Sen. Feinstein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>193</td><td>"And if a very qualified woman can hold that job, and perform well... that's a big thing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>194</td><td>And will it be harder for a woman to run, even in 2016?</td></tr>
<tr><td>195</td><td>"Oh I think it is harder. And I think she knows it's harder," says Feinstein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>196</td><td>"And women are tested in ways that men are not. And that's another discussion."</td></tr>
