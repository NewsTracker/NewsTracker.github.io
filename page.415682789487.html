<h3>Israel’s Netanyahu Apologizes to Country’s Arab Minority</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Netanyahu, whose Likud Party won re-election in the vote, met with members of the Arab community at the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem on Monday and apologized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He says he knows his "comments last week offended some Israeli citizens and offended members of the Israeli-Arab community."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu says: "This was never my intent. I apologize for this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu drew accusations of racism in Israel, especially from its Arab minority, and a White House rebuke when, just a few hours before polling stations were to close across the country, he warned that Arab citizens were voting "in droves."</td></tr>
