<h3>Shark kills German tourist on Egypt's Red Sea Coast</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The official says the 52-year-old man's body had been moved to a local hospital after the attack Saturday and that officials were conducting an investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He says the shark bit off the man's leg at the knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An official from the German Embassy in Cairo says they have received reports that a German citizen died in the area but are not aware of the cause of death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>All officials spoke Sunday on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to brief reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egypt is one of the world's top diving destinations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Similar attacks have happened in the past -- in 2010, a shark killed a 70-year-old German tourist while she was snorkeling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That death in 2010 was part of a spate of shark attacks that sent the government scrambling to protect the image of its important tourism industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At the time, the South Sinai governor suggested Israel's foreign spy service, the Mossad, may have played a role in the uptick of attacks, something the Israeli government denied.</td></tr>
