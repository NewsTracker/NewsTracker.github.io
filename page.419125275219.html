<h3>Sister of jailed Egypt activist urges IS not to kill Croat</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The sister of a woman jailed in Egypt for alleged ties to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood is urging the Islamic State group not to kill a Croatian hostage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The group had earlier said it would do so in the coming hours if the Egyptian government does not release jailed "Muslim women."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Doaa el-Taweel, sister of jailed photographer and activist Esraa el-Taweel, said on Friday that her sister is innocent but that "her release should not come at the expense of another innocent person."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Extremists of the Islamic State released a video on Wednesday threatening to kill the Croatian hostage in 48 hours if authorities failed to release "Muslim women" held in Egyptian jails - a reference to female Islamists detained in the government's broad crackdown on Brotherhood supporters.</td></tr>
