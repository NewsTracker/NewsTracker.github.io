<h3>Justice Dept. examining Ferguson racial discrimination</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CNN reported the Justice Department is preparing to bring a lawsuit against Ferguson if the police department does not make changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In August, Ferguson was thrust into the limelight when white police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teen Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Justice Department is not expected to charge Wilson, but could outline a pattern of discriminatory practices used by the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"If they don't agree to review and revise those tactics, sources say, the Justice Department would sue to force changes in the department," CNN reported, adding there would be court supervision over the changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Thomas Harvey, executive director of Arch City Defenders, said he and others have met with the Justice Department, including Christy Lopez, the deputy chief of the department's Civil Rights Special Litigation Section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"All discussions with the Justice Department have focused on what we believe to be a connection between the allegations of police misconduct and the erosion of trust between members of communities of color and their government," Harvey told Politico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In early February, 15 residents filed a federal lawsuit against Ferguson and Jennings for what amounts to a modern-day debtors prison, putting poor people behind bars for minor offenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The jails are often overcrowded and unsanitary, the lawsuits said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The lawsuits, which seek class-action status, say the cities use the money to generate revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Ferguson Police issued a statement refuting the claims.</td></tr>
