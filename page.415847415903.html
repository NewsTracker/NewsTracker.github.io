<h3>Soros says ready to invest $1 billion in Ukraine if West helps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>VIENNA (Reuters) - Billionaire financier George Soros is ready to invest $1 billion in Ukraine, if Western countries help private investment there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He also put the odds of Greece leaving the euro at a third, in an interview with Austrian newspaper Der Standard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Soros has previously urged the West to step up aid to Ukraine, outlining steps towards a $50 billion financing package that he said should be viewed as a bulwark against an increasingly aggressive Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The West can help Ukraine by increasing attractiveness for investors. A political risk insurance is necessary. This could take the form of mezzanine financing at EU interest rates -- very close to zero," he said in an interview published on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I stand ready. There are concrete investment ideas, for example in agriculture and infrastructure projects. I would put in $1 billion. This must generate a profit. My foundation would benefit from this ... Private engagement needs strong political leadership."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Hungarian-born hedge fund magnate, who made his name betting against the pound in 1992, also put the chance of Greece leaving the euro zone at a third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last week he put it at 50:50.</td></tr>
