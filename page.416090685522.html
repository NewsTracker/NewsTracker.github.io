<h3>Egypt to try another 379 Brotherhood members over sit-in violence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 379 are accused of causing the deaths of two policemen at al-Nahda Square in Giza, one of two sites where supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi gathered in the weeks following his overthrow by the military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They face charges including murder and vandalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The government accuses the Brotherhood of fomenting an Islamist insurgency since Mursi's removal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Militant attacks have killed hundreds of Egyptians, mostly soldiers and police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Security forces have killed hundreds and detained thousands of members of the group, which says it is committed to political change through peaceful means only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prosecutor Hisham Barakat said in a statement that two police officers had also been referred to court, accused of torturing a lawyer to death at a Cairo police station last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prosecutions against members of the security forces are rare in Egypt where the police have reasserted powers eroded since the 2011 popular uprising that ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Critics say the police now act with impunity, an accusation the Interior Ministry denies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Four policemen were charged last month in separate cases involving the deaths of a female protester and a suspected Brotherhood member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Foreign governments and rights groups have condemned the use of force to disperse demonstrations at Nahda and Rabaa squares, the bloodiest event in Egypt's recent history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cairo has defended its actions, saying it had given protesters the opportunity to leave peacefully and that armed elements within the Brotherhood initiated the violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Barakat also ordered a former provincial governor to stand trial for violating a strict protest law that has landed many of the leaders of the 2011 uprising behind bars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Elsewhere, at least 11 civilians, including women and children, were killed in the North Sinai town of Sheikh Zuweid near the border with Israel when a rocket-proplled grenade landed on their houses, security and medical sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The source of the attack was not immediately clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Egypt's government faces an Islamist insurgency based in that strategic region and growing discontent with what critics perceive as heavy handed security tactics.</td></tr>
