<h3>Sepp Blatter: I?ve tried to tame soccer?s monstrous success</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ZURICH (AP) - In a rare interview with a free Swiss daily newspaper during his re-election campaign, FIFA President Sepp Blatter claims he has tried to "tame the monster" of soccer's success during his 17-year reign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blatter told Tuesday's edition of free Swiss daily 20 Minutes that his presidency benefited from a boom in soccer's finances and development fueled by television rights deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter said predecessor Joao Havelange once told him: "Sepp, you created a monster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In reply, Blatter said he told Havelange: "Yes, but I try to tame the monster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Blatter cited a German magazine's estimate that 1.6 billion people are linked to playing, organizing and following soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The power of the sport is "wonderful even if at the same time it's scary," said the FIFA president, who has seen the governing body's income top $2 billion for the first time in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The daily newspaper reports that questions about the May 29 election were not allowed for its interview, tied to a FIFA-promoted youth tournament which kicks off Wednesday in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I am the president and not a candidate," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This is why I don't want to speak about this vote."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The 79-year-old Swiss is expected to get win again.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Blatter distanced himself from the disgraced Havelange when asked by 20 Minutes why he had not prepared a successor, as the Brazilian did for him before his first victory in 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Havelange "never trained a successor," said Blatter, adding that "the successor built himself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Now 99, Havelange led FIFA for 24 years before becoming honorary president.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>"Believe me, the delegates are very gladly come to Switzerland," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Switzerland is a paradise."</td></tr>
