<h3>Mary J. Blige shines at unofficial SXSW event</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>AUSTIN, Texas - Mary J. Blige performed for a feverish crowd at the Samsung Supper Club in an event not sponsored by South by Southwest, another sign of unofficial concerts rivaling the festival when it comes to pulling big-name acts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blige is no dancer, but the performer moved energetically at the Tuesday night show in Austin, even imitating Michael Jackson's dance moves during her funky hit, "Just Fine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She moved like a pro, though there was water dripping from the covered ceiling on the venue's rooftop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She managed to manoeuvr in heels and an ab-revealing crop top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Blige closed with her pop hit, "Family Affair."</td></tr>
