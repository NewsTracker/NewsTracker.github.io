<tr><td>5</td><td>A writ filed in Chicago in the United States on Wednesday claimed that Igor Strelkov, a Russian also known as Igor Girkin, was acting with the "actual or apparent" authority of President Putin's government when the Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down over eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to AFP the court papers say: "Flight 17 flew over the airspace of the area in which the aforesaid rebel army was waging its war activities and the rebel army under the command responsibility of defendant Girkin shot down the subject Boeing 777-200 aircraft."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The airliner was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it crashed on 17 July 2014.</td></tr>
