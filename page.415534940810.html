<h3>Russia to send new missiles to Baltic region</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOSCOW - Russia plans to station state-of-the art missiles in its westernmost Baltic exclave and deploy nuclear-capable bombers to Crimea as part of massive war games to showcase its resurgent military power amid bitter tensions with the West over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Russian military exercises this week range from the Arctic to the Pacific Ocean and involve tens of thousands of troops, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Iskander missiles will be sent to the Kaliningrad region that borders NATO members Poland and Lithuania as part of the maneuvers, said a Defense Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to comment publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The official also said Russia will deploy long-range, nuclear-capable Tu-22M3 bombers to Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a statement, the Defense Ministry said the Baltic Fleet, the Southern Military District and the Airborne Forces have been brought to the highest stage of combat readiness and have started moving to shooting ranges as part of the drills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The wide-ranging exercise started Monday, when President Vladimir Putin ordered the Northern Fleet and other military forces on combat alert as part of the exercise in the Arctic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Other units in the Pacific region, southern Siberia and southwestern Russia also launched drills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Iskander missiles deployment to Kaliningrad reflects Moscow's readiness to raise the ante in response to NATO moves to deploy forces closer to Russia's borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The missiles, which are capable of hitting enemy targets up to 310 miles away with high precision, can be equipped with a nuclear or a conventional warhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>From Kaliningrad, they could reach several NATO member states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz interpreted the move as an attempt by Russia to pressure EU nations as they consider possible new sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Russia is making this gesture before the European Council meeting," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It is trying to influence European Council decisions concerning extending or adding new sanctions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics of Latvia, which holds the EU presidency, said Tuesday he did not expect "a discussion of new sanctions or any decisions" when EU leaders meet Thursday in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Kremlin has voiced concern about U.S. plans to beef up its military presence near Russia's borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Later this month, U.S. troops are holding joint exercises with forces from EU nations Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</td></tr>

<h3>4 more aid workers flown back to US for Ebola monitoring</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The latest arrivals bring to 15 the number of aid workers who have returned from Sierra Leone since Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>None of them have been diagnosed with Ebola, but they will be isolated and monitored during the next three weeks for signs of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Officials have released few details, citing patient privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But all are connected to - or had direct physical contact with - another American who came down with Ebola last week in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The unidentified man is in critical condition at a National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The other aid workers are staying near the Maryland hospital or hospitals in Atlanta and Omaha with special isolation units - in case they become sick, according to officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The sick American works with Partners in Health, a Boston-based international aid organization that has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Organization officials did not respond to calls and emails from The Associated Press on Monday or Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a statement Tuesday, co-founder Dr. Paul Farmer said the group is working with the CDC and others to investigate how the man was infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Ebola virus is spread through contact with a sick patient's blood or bodily fluids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The World Health Organization estimates the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since last summer, several U.S. aid workers have gotten Ebola and have been flown back to the U.S. for care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A few other individuals have returned for monitoring; none got sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The aid workers who have returned since Friday are by far the largest group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And more may be on their way later this week, CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The sick American worker was working at a government hospital in Port Loko in western Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But medical superintendent Dr. Peter George said the hospital hasn't had any Ebola cases for quite some time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said it's likely the man also worked at a nearby Ebola treatment center, which George also manages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>George said a Partners in Health colleague told him the American passed out while at the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"At that time, nobody knew it was Ebola, so they assisted him," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Everyone who was working on the ward with the man is now being monitored, George said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He said that many of the foreigners working in Port Loko, including some of the Americans, live at the same tent camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He did not know if the sick health worker was living there.</td></tr>
