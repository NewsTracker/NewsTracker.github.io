<h3>Michael Brown's Parents File Lawsuit Against Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this March 5, 2015, file photo, Lesley McSpadden, mother of Michael Brown Jr., listens to the family attorney during a news conference in Dellwood, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lawyers for the parents of Brown, the unarmed, black 18-year-old who was fatally shot by a white police officer in a St. Louis suburb, announced Wednesday, April 22, 2015, that they planned to file a civil lawsuit the following day against the city of Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Michael Brown's parents filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city of Ferguson on Thursday, opening a new chapter in the legal battle over the shooting that killed their son and sparked a national protest movement about the way police treat blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Attorneys for Brown's parents promised the case would bring to light new forensic evidence and raise doubts about the police version of events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some of that evidence, they said, had been overlooked in previous investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The narrative of the law enforcement all across the country for shooting unarmed people of color is the same: That they had no other choice," attorney Benjamin Crump said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"But time and time again, the objective evidence contradicts the standard police narrative."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., attended a news conference announcing the lawsuit outside the St. Louis County Courthouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A tear rolled down McSpadden's cheek as Crump spoke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The case had been expected for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If it comes to trial, the lawsuit could force a full review of all the evidence in the shooting and bring key witnesses to be questioned in open court, including Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Wilson and former Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson were also named in the complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Civil cases generally require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Jurors must base their decision on a preponderance of evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard needed to convict in a criminal trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A Ferguson city spokesman declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Messages left for an attorney for Wilson were not immediately returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Jackson declined to discuss the lawsuit, telling The Associated Press that he was unaware of it until a reporter told him and had not had a chance to review the allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Brown, 18, was unarmed and walking in the street with a friend on Aug. 9 when Wilson told them to move to the sidewalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The lawsuit alleges that Wilson told the two to "get the (expletive) out of the street," causing tension to escalate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Without the "unnecessary and unwarranted profane language," the encounter would have been "uneventful," it says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Moments later, Wilson and Brown became involved in a scuffle through the open window of Wilson's police vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Wilson shot Brown after the scuffle spilled into the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some witnesses said Brown appeared to be trying to surrender, but Wilson said Brown was moving toward him aggressively, forcing him to shoot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The attorneys said they planned to cite Wilson's own initial comments to a supervisor in which, according to the lawsuit, he said Brown had his arms raised moments before the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Brown's death led to weeks of sometimes-violent demonstrations and spawned a national "Black Lives Matter" movement seeking changes in how police deal with minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In the end, local and federal authorities ruled that the shooting was justified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In the months since Brown was killed, unarmed blacks have been fatally shot by police in Wisconsin, California, Oklahoma, South Carolina and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Unlike Brown's death, some of those shootings were caught on video.</td></tr>
