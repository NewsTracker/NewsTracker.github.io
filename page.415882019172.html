<h3>Google Maps launches Pacman on real streets</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google has launched an April Fool's Day version of Google Maps that allows users to play the classic arcade game Pac-Man on real streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google Map users can access the Pac-Man version by clicking on the icon in the bottom corner of the screen and then using their keyboard to play the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The game is accessible on desktop computers and on the Google Maps app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It allows users to play the famous game around the world's most recognisable streets or your own neighbourhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At some famous locations, such as the area around the Taj Mahal and the Arc de Triomphe, Google has added a Pac-Man marker that also launches the game because the areas appear perfectly matched to the original Pac-Man layout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a blog post explaining the game, which also makes clear that it is an April Fool's Day prank, Michelle Luo, product manager at Google, said: "Over the years, we&#x2019;ve updated Google Maps to make it more accurate, comprehensive and useful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Google maps pacman could be stupidly addictive!</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"When navigating fruit-filled streets, determine at a glance which turns to pass to evade ghosts and get where you&#x2019;re going safely. When you&#x2019;re feeling a bit peckish, you can simply gobble up a few pac-dots or a cherry and keep on nommin."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ms Luo then adds: "This is just the beginning, so stay tuned for more Maps fun such as zombie incident alerts and intergalactic Street View. Oh, and be sure to check out what our friends at Ingress are up to. It looks like PAC-MAN chomped his way over to the real-world!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The game is likely to be hugely popular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Google has launched playable versions of Pac-Man before, including a Google Doodle in 2010 to mark the 30th anniversary of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One analyst claimed this Google Doodle consumed 4,819,352 hours of employee time and cost the US economy an estimated $120,483,80 ( 81,179,374).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Marissa Mayer, now the chief executive of Yahoo!</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>but then the vice president of user experience at Google, said the company had been "overwhelmed, but not surprised" by the reception given to the Pac-Man doodle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Due to popular demand, we're making it permanently available at google.com/pacman," she said.</td></tr>
