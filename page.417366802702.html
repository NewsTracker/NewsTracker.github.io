<h3>German newspaper corrects IMF chief Lagarde's Greece comments</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has corrected an interview with International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde in which she had been quoted as saying that a Greek exit from the euro zone was a "possibility".</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>"We are not naive and we don't think that this is going to be or would be a walk in the park. It's a complicated issue and it's one that I hope the Europeans will not have to face because hopefully they will find a path to agree with the future of Greece within the euro zone," Lagarde was quoted as saying in the transcript.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FAZ, a leading German financial newspaper, said it had "changed" Lagarde's quote.</td></tr>
