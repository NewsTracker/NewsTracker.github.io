<h3>Kerry: Confident about fight against Islamic State group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Secretary of State John Kerry says he's confident about the fight against the Islamic State group, despite the setbacks like the loss of Ramadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kerry, who is traveling through Korea, says that he's long said the fight against the terrorist group would be a long one, and that it would be tough in the Anbar province of western Iraq where Iraqi security forces are not built up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said that Ramadi was a "target of opportunity" but he's confident that in coming days that can be reversed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ramadi fell to the Islamic State group on Sunday, as Iraqi forces abandoned their weapons and armored vehicles to flee the provincial capital in a major loss despite intensified U.S.-led airstrikes.</td></tr>
