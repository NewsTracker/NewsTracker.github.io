<tr><td>3</td><td>A U.S. search team identified the wreckage as that of the missing Marines UH-1Y Huey helicopter deployed after Nepal was hit by a massive earthquake last month that killed more than 8,200 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The wreckage of the helicopter was found in pieces, and there are no chances of any survivors," Nepal's Defense Secretary Iswori Poudyal said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>The helicopter was carrying six Marines and two Nepalese army soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The assessment of the site is ongoing and a thorough investigation will be conducted," a statement from a Marine-led joint task force said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The U.S. statement made no mention of the fate of the six Marines and two Nepali soldiers on board the Huey that went missing on Tuesday, the day a strong aftershock hit Nepal and killed more than 100 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The wreckage was found about 15 miles from the town of Charikot, near where the aircraft had gone missing on Tuesday while delivering humanitarian aid to villages hit by two deadly earthquakes, according to the U.S. military joint task force in Okinawa, Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The area is near Gothali village in the district of Dolakha, about 50 miles northeast of Nepal's capital Kathmandu.</td></tr>
