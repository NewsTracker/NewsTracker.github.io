<h3>Egypt court seeks death sentence for 11 in soccer stadium case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Egyptian court sentenced 11 football fans to death after a retrial over a 2012 stadium riot in the canal city of Port Said that left 74 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Egyptian court on Sunday took a step towards imposing the death penalty on 11 men for involvement in deadly soccer stadium violence in 2012, in a court session shown on television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The judge referred the sentencing to Egypt's Grand Mufti, the country's most senior religious authority, a step towards the death penalty, which could be imposed at a later court hearing on May 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Soccer matches are often a flashpoint for violence in the country but the Port Said incident was Egypt's worst ever soccer disaster, killing more than 70 fans and injuring at least 1,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many of those killed were crushed when panicked fans tried to escape from the stadium after a post-match pitch invasion by supporters of the local side al-Masry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Others fell or were thrown from terraces, witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In January 2013, a court sentenced 21 people to death in the case, but after more than a year, the High Court overturned the sentences and ordered a retrial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Grand Mufti's decision is not binding but referral is needed in order to impose a death sentence.</td></tr>
