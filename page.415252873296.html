<tr><td>3</td><td>First it revolutionized the personal computing business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Then, with the launch of the iPod in 2001, it forced the music industry to change its tune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Against initial market reservations, the company succeeded at making Star Trek-like tablets hip when it released the iPad in 2010, and in the last quarter, a record 75 million units of its now-ubiquitous iPhone were sold around the globe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The smartphone's operating system, iOS, currently controls a jaw-dropping 89-percent share of all systems worldwide, pushing the second-place OS, Google Google's Android, down to 11 percent from 30 percent just a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As you might already know, the company that Steve Jobs built is history's largest by net capitalization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In its last quarterly report, Apple posted a record $75 billion in revenue and is now sitting pretty on a mind-boggling $180 billion in cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Friday, it was announced that Apple will be joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing AT&T AT&T.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Many analysts believe the company will reach a jaw-dropping $1 trillion in market cap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So what's Apple's next trick?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>How about moving the world's gold market?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This April, Apple will be venturing into the latest wearable gadget market, the smartwatch, joining competitors such as Samsung, Garmin Garmin and Sony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>All of the models in Apple's stable of watches look sleek and beautifully designed-just what you'd expect from Apple-and will no doubt be capable of performing all sorts of high-tech functions such as receiving text messages, monitoring the wearer's vitals and, of course, telling time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the real story here is that the company's high-end luxury model, referred to simply as the Apple Watch Edition, will come encased in 18-karat gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>What should make this news even more exciting to gold investors is that the company expects to produce 1 million units of this particular model per month in the second quarter of 2015 alone, according to the Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
