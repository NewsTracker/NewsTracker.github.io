<h3>Google wireless phone service challenges major carriers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Google is offering a wireless phone service designed to pressure major carriers such as AT&T and Verizon Wireless into lowering their prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The service, called "Project Fi," will cost $20 per month and only charge customers for the amount of cellular data that they use each month instead of a flat rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Each gigabyte of data will cost $10 per month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That means a customer could sign up for a plan offering three gigabytes of data and get $20 back if only one gigabyte was used in a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Most wireless phone carriers allow their customers to roll over unused data into another month of service without refunding any money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google's service initially will be available only on the Nexus 6, a Motorola phone made with Google's help.</td></tr>
