<h3>Google to be part of new holding company, ‘Alphabet’</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google is adopting this structure in order to make clearer the difference between its main business and longer-term endeavors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sundar Pichai, currently Google's senior vice president of products, will be the Google CEO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Larry Page, Google's co-founder and chief executive, will become the CEO of Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sergey Brin, co-founder at Google Inc., will be president of the newly structured company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google is changing its corporate structure to separate its search, YouTube and other Web companies from its research and investment divisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The shares rose as much as 5.8 percent in extended trading after the company said Alphabet will be the name of what will effectively be a new holding company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It will include Google Inc. and Google Ventures, Google Capital, Google X and other subsidiaries, the Web company said in a blog post on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Larry Page will be Alphabet's chief executive officer, while co-founder Sergey Brin will be president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ruth Porat will be chief financial officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sundar Pichai, Page's deputy, will be promoted to become CEO of Google Inc., which generates the bulk of Google's $60 billion in annual revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The goal isn't to make Alphabet a consumer brand, Page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Google is adopting this structure in order to make clearer the difference between its main business and longer-term endeavors, as Page and Brin take on more strategic roles, while leaving operational management to trusted deputies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We've long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes," Page wrote in the post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Shares of Google fell less than 1 percent to $663.14 at Monday's close in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The stock is up 25 percent this year, with much of the gains coming after the company reported quarterly results last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The new structure will be introduced in phases over the coming months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Alphabet will report its results under this new structure commencing with the fourth-quarter earnings release, typically posted in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>With this move, investors will get more details on how the businesses are operating, a longstanding request from Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Under the change, the core Google company will report separately from the investment and research arms, according to a filing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Page said.</td></tr>
