<h3>Execution of Bali Nine duo in limbo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla took a phone call on Thursday afternoon from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the men's transfer to the execution site on Nusakambangan island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to his spokesman, Husain Abdullah, Mr Kalla told Ms Bishop the executions had been delayed "three weeks to one month" because of technical issues, news website beritasatu.com reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, Ms Bishop and Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo deny the length of the delay was discussed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said a date for the transfer had not been set because more co-ordination was needed and he didn't think Mr Kalla would have given a timeframe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I've never said that and I don't think the vice president would have said that," Mr Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He only leaves it all to us because when a sentence already has final, legally binding status and all legal (appeal) aspects have been fulfilled, the execution is the prosecutor's obligation and responsibility."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At Kerobokan jail on Friday, meetings to plan the transfer to Nusakambangan jail continued, but no date was set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"As soon as Nusakambangan is ready, we'll send them immediately," Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gusto Kompiang Adnyana, head of Bali's Law and Human Rights Office, said: "There's no time for the transfer yet. We haven't co-ordinated with Nusakambangan either."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The delay gives Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, precious days with their families, and precious time for their lawyers to ready their final legal manoeuvres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Melbourne barrister Michael O'Connell SC visited the death row Australians in Kerobokan jail on Thursday to go over arrangements for next week's administrative court challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They will argue President Joko Widodo did not properly examine their requests for clemency before rejecting them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr O'Connell says it's a strong case, but lawyers will first have to clear jurisdictional hurdles - whether Mr Joko's decree can be characterised under administrative law or is simply a decision that's a matter for the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>At the same time, the lawyers' complaints against the original six judges in the Bali Nine pair's trial are being examined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Indonesia's judicial commission has contacted the lawyers for more information about their concerns, which came after the original lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran alleged "interference" that saw the Australians sentenced to death instead of life for the 2005 drug-smuggling bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It has been a roller-coaster week for the men, their families and friends at Kerobokan jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At the start of the week, there were expectations the pair would be moved within days and Sukumaran's family began clearing his art studio of books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Then on Tuesday, it was announced the transfer would not take place this week because isolation cells and the execution site itself were not ready to cater to so many prisoners at once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr O'Connell said the Sydney men were coping extremely well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"They're humbled really by the depth of support that has been coming from Australia and to some extent in Indonesia as well," he said on Thursday.</td></tr>

<h3>NASCAR seeks to use racing to spark classroom interest in math, science</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a nod to the often overlooked science behind races like Sunday's Daytona 500, NASCAR is announcing a years-long commitment to promote "STEM" - the buzzword for science, technology, engineering and math - inside classrooms and out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The NASCAR Acceleration Nation initiative focuses on the three D's of speed - downforce, drafting and drag - and includes instructional materials for teachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The effort being announced Friday is a way for NASCAR to show the fun side of engineering and math and to encourage fans to view NASCAR in a new way, said Brent Dewar, NASCAR's chief operating officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"A lot of people see cars racing and they love the sport for the sporting element of cars winning, and racing and passing," Dewar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Behind all of that is pure science. It's the horse power, and it's drag and it's aerodynamics."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Driver Carl Edwards was a substitute teacher in Columbia, Missouri, long before he became known for his back-flip off cars after winning races.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For him, one of the biggest teaching challenges was keeping students' attention, and he hopes that bringing race cars into science discussions will spark interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Edwards said that with every lap, scientific data is involved, from tracking the statistical probability of crashing at different parts of the race to the amount of fuel used by the engine at different speeds in various throttle positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Although he said he still uses the science and math he learned in school, Edwards wishes he'd learned even more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"You can take any part of the car and talk about how it was engineered and why it's designed the way it is to interact with the rest of the race car, and there's a physics or a math or a science lesson in any of that," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As part of the initiative, NASCAR partnered with publisher Scholastic Corp. to develop fact sheets and quizzes primarily for middle school teachers focused on aerodynamics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An example of topics addressed: Why can race cars in a drafting formation lined up behind each other go faster than cars moving solo?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>(The answer is that the air acts like a vacuum and sucks trailing cars forward; leading cars also get a boost because the trailing cars push high-pressure air over the leading cars' spoilers.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>About 7,400 kits will be mailed to teachers initially, but teachers can also go online to download the material and view online demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The effort includes a website for fans with math and other games and an interactive play area that children and teens can visit on race days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>NASCAR's effort is part of a larger push in both the private and public sector to promote STEM out of concern for the nation's global competitiveness and because of strong projected job growth in those fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Michael Lynch, a NASCAR executive involved with the effort, said NASCAR is tracking how students do on a quiz before and after using the material, so they can see what works and what needs to be changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>NASCAR wouldn't say how much it's spending on the STEM-related activities.</td></tr>
