<h3>Giles Coren rants on Twitter about being 'screwed' for Amazon Prime service</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The furious shoppers spoke out after being hit with the yearly charge when their 30-day free trial expired, meaning the price was raised to the regular 79-a-year rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One Conservative councillor checked his Amazon account only to realise he had been paying for the service for five years without knowing, while another shocked subscriber said she was 'livid'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>All Amazon customers will be asked to sign up for a free 30-day trial of Amazon Prime at the site's digital checkout, offering them free one-day delivery on their purchases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, reading the small print reveals that after this 30-day trial ends, buyers will be charged the 79-a-year rate, which includes movie streaming services, among other things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The unwitting subscribers were responding to a tweet by food critic and TV personality Giles Coren after he discovered he had been charged for the service for two years without using it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Sunday he messaged his 164,000 followers saying: 'You b******* Amazon!</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I can't believe you've been screwing me for 79 a year for Prime!</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I had no idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'I mean, Amazon offer a free trial in 2012, then quietly start charging 79 and never tell me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That's what sicko porn sites do!</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Initially customers were billed 49 per year for the service, but this was hiked to 79 in February last year after Amazon bought LoveFilm and included access to it as part of the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Amazon customers can tell if they've signed up to Prime by going to the My Account section of the site, located in the top right hand corner of the homepage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Once there, scroll down the page until you see the 'Settings' section, then look under the 'Account settings' column for a option called 'Manage Prime Membership'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Once you have clicked on that, a new page will open up, telling you whether you are signed up to Prime, how long you have been a member, and who is being charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>If you want to end your membership, there will be a button on this page allowing you to do this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If you think you have been wrongly charged for Prime, you can apply for a refund via the customer services page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Lauranne Pearce, from Derbyshire, added: 'I've just checked and yep 79 lighter and didn't even know it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile Sally Roberts, from London, said she was 'livid' after also being caught out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Coren, who has become known for his often savage restaurant reviews and rants against sub-editors of his column at The Times, added: 'Come on people, check your Amazon accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'If you're being secretly f***** by 'Prime' let me know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Amazon has long received complaints over its practice of automatically charging customers after the free trial expired, with website moneysavingexpert.com speaking about it back in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In recent weeks the UK service has also been attacked for being the most expensive in Europe after it was revealed customers in Italy pay just 7.50 per year for Prime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Amazon say that the UK Prime service includes access to hundreds of movies and TV shows to stream online, as well as online space for storing pictures, and the ability to borrow Kindle books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The UK service also includes free one-day delivery on millions of items, while Italian Prime only includes free 2-3 day delivery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>However UK customers are not given the option of taking the cheaper service if they do not want to use all the features of UK Prime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>An Amazon spokesman said: 'Customers who sign up to a free trial of Prime receive an email informing them of the duration of the free trial and how to avoid continuing to paid Prime Membership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>'Customers who become full Prime members can cancel their membership at any time and we will refund the full membership if the customer has not made any eligible purchases or used any Prime benefits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Amazon did offer Mr Coren a refund online today after saying he had misunderstood the terms and conditions, but he refused, adding that he wasn't asking to be reimbursed, but was informing his followers of the practice.</td></tr>
