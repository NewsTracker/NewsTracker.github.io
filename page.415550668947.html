<h3>Disney parks chairman Bob Chapek focuses on tech, franchises</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bob Chapek became Disney's parks and resorts chairman last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The longtime Disney leader has made high tech and big blockbuster brands hallmarks of his career in the company's consumer products and studio divisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chapek, 55, replaces Tom Staggs, whom Disney promoted to chief operating officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>New to theme parks, Chapek will report to both Staggs and Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Staggs said Disney wants someone who will continue the momentum at the company's parks, which set record attendance in the United States last quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chapek has built a reputation as a fast-moving innovator who recognizes what will click with consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He understands the Disney brand," Staggs said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He understands and thinks in terms of being consumer-centric."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Chapek will run the $15 billion division from California, where Disney has its headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He lives in Santa Rosa Valley with his wife, Cindy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chapek, whom Disney did not make available for an interview, now leads about 130,000 employees, more than half in Orlando.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He will oversee the rollout of Disney World's MyMagic+ into other parks, construction of the Animal Kingdom's Avatar land and development of Star Wars attractions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Overseas, he will open Shanghai Disney Resort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chapek also runs Disney's time shares, cruise line and packaged-tour business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It's a far cry from his first career path, which had led him toward cells instead of Cinderella's Castle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Chapek earned a microbiology degree from Indiana University Bloomington and worked briefly as a lab assistant before deciding the work was too isolating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Chapek earned an MBA from Michigan State University, where he guest lectures and will soon deliver a commencement address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He worked at Heinz and J.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Walter Thompson before becoming Disney's home-entertainment marketing director 22 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He went on to run home entertainment and film distribution before taking over consumer products in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"He was always an executive that you knew would be on the rise," said Michael Eisner, who was Disney's chief executive officer when Chapek was president of home entertainment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"He knew how to grow the business while adjusting to the changing marketplace, which was intense."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Chapek was credited with bringing Disney's home entertainment into the digital age, including transforming its primary format from DVD to Blu-ray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>At Disney Consumer Products, Chapek led an overhaul that included getting rid of dozens of employees and bringing on more tech-savvy ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Disney's digital products include a learning app series and tablets that trigger animation when pointed at toys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Chapek brought on a chief technology officer for Disney Consumer Products and created an "idea lab" where employees are working on a stable of new high-tech products set to launch later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Chapek also is a disciple of Disney's heavy focus on franchises - big-budget movies that spawn sequels, toys and increasingly, theme-park attractions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Chapek reorganized the consumer products business around brands such as Disney princesses rather than products such as shoes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>That approach means "now you have each franchise focusing on brand look, brand experiences, to make sure the products are really apropos," said Stephen Berman, chief executive officer of Disney licensee Jakks Pacific.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Even as he rose through the executive ranks, Chapek maintained a reputation for being approachable - whether answering an old professor's email within minutes or agreeing to meet with a promising college student.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Chapek, a father of three grown children, grew up in the blue-collar town of Hammond, Ind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He learned the value of hard work from his late father Bernie, an oil-field machinist who worked extra shifts to support his family, and mom Marie, who was an office assistant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>They "worked hard for the nicer things in life," Chapek is quoted as saying in the Times of Northwest Indiana in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I saw their role-modeling, and it made a permanent impact on my drive and ambition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Chapek relishes his Disney work, said Glenn Omura, an associate Michigan State marketing professor who still keeps in touch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He describes Chapek as an "animated and energetic" person who "has a lot of fun doing what he's doing. He's one of those people at Disney that believes in the magic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Berman said Chapek brought about "a dramatic cultural change" in Disney Consumer Products, making it more nimble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>After "Frozen" became a box-office hit, Berman called Chapek to pitch an idea he dreamed up: snow-cone makers and Mr. Potato Head-like toys featuring Olaf the snowman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The toys were produced in just a few months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Such a process would have probably taken a year and a half prior to Chapek coming on board, Berman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The $4 billion division had double-digit growth in revenue and operating income under Chapek's watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Disney stores appear different every few months because of frequent merchandise changes, Omura said, who predicts the same will happen at Disney parks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"He'll go in there and find ways to innovate, to change it, to give it a fresh feel," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"So every time you go into a Disney park or resort, it will feel different."</td></tr>
