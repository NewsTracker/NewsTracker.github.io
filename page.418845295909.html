<h3>US, Turkey seek to establish Islamic State-free zone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) - The United States and Turkey are finalizing plans for a military campaign to push the Islamic State out of a strip of land along the Syrian border, deepening efforts to halt the extremists' advances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A U.S. official said the creation of an "Islamic State-free zone" would ensure greater security and stability in the Turkish-Syrian border region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, the official said any joint military efforts with Turkey would not include the imposition of a no-fly zone, a step Washington has long resisted despite Turkish requests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The discussions come amid a major tactical shift in Turkey's approach to the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After months of reluctance, Turkish warplanes started striking militant targets in Syria last week, following a long-awaited agreement allowing the U.S. to launch its own strikes from the strategically located Incirlik Air Base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The official insisted on anonymity because this person was not authorized to publicly discuss the talks with Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Despite the U.S. and Turkey's shared interests in fighting the Islamic State, the Turks have also prioritized defeating Syrian President Bashar Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While the U.S. says Assad has lost legitimacy, it has not taken direct military action to try to remove him from office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Turkey's new airstrike campaign also includes a second front targeting the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The U.S. has relied on Syrian Kurdish fighters affiliated with the PKK to help make gains against the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Turkey accuses the PKK of not keeping pledges to withdraw armed fighters from its territory and disarm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Turks are also concerned that gains made by Kurds in Iraq and in Syria could encourage its own minority to seek independence.</td></tr>
