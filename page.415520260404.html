<h3>Israelis go to the polls</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The outcome of the race, in which opinion polls suggest Netanyahu will win fewer seats than the centre-left Zionist Union, is likely to help determine the prospects for new Middle East peace talks and Israel's troubled relations with its US ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Around six million voters are eligible to take part in the election for Israel's 120 members of parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Polls close at 2000 GMT (0700 AEDT) with exit polls by Israel's main media outlets set to give the first indications of the likely outcome minutes afterwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu brought the election on himself, calling the snap vote after firing centrist ministers from his fractious coalition just two years into its term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It will be Israel's third election since 2009 and the biggest challenge yet for the 65-year-old incumbent, who is seeking a third consecutive term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Final opinion polls published on Friday gave the Zionist Union of Labour leader Isaac Herzog a three to four seat lead over Netanyahu's Likud party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the surveys also suggested Netanyahu will have an advantage when it comes to piecing together a coalition with smaller allies from the right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As he cast his own ballot on Tuesday, Netanyahu ruled out any alliance with Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There will not be a unity government with Labour. I will form a national (rightwing) government," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Netanyahu has warned a vote for the Zionist Union could endanger Israel's security and lead to the division of Jerusalem and the establishment of a Palestinian state in the annexed eastern sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Monday he was asked by the rightwing NRG website if it was true that there would be no Palestinian state established if he was reelected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Indeed," said Netanyahu, who in 2009 had endorsed the idea of two states living side by side.</td></tr>
