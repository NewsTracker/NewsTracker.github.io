<h3>Houston avoids elimination with 124-103 win over Clippers (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HOUSTON (AP) -- James Harden received an IV Tuesday afternoon, his answers to postgame questions were peppered with coughs and he sniffled repeatedly between queries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Harden clearly wasn't feeling well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But faced with elimination in the Western Conference semifinals, Houston's bearded superstar shook off his illness and had a triple-double in perhaps his best playoff performance to keep the Rockets alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Harden had 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists, Dwight Howard added 20 points and 15 rebounds, and the Rockets bounced back from two lopsided losses with a 124-103 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''I'm all right,'' Harden said when asked about his health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Rockets hadn't lost three straight all season, and with their season on the line they ended their skid to send it back to Los Angeles for Game 6 on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Houston used a 36-point second quarter to take a commanding lead and withstood a third-quarter surge by Los Angeles to lead by 14 entering the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Blake Griffin had 30 points and 16 rebounds, and Chris Paul added 22 points and 10 assists for the Clippers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''They were more focused,'' Clippers coach Doc Rivers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Harden made a 3-pointer with about two minutes to play to make it 121-100 and coach Kevin McHale cleared the bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Harden's triple-double was Houston's first in the postseason since Steve Francis in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Howard was impressed with Harden's ability to play so well when he was under the weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''This is win or go home and I'm pretty sure he wants this as bad as we all do and he showed that tonight,'' Howard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Trevor Ariza added 22 points for Houston and Corey Brewer had 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>McHale toyed with the starting lineup after losses by 25 and 33 points, inserting Josh Smith in place of Terrence Jones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Smith finished with nine points and seven rebounds, while Jones provided a spark off the bench with 12 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I just wanted to shake things up a bit and ... see if we could get more ball movement,'' McHale said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Houston was up by 14 with nine minutes left when Smith scored five quick points, capped by a 3-pointer, to make it 99-80.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Smith, who joined the Rockets after being released by the Pistons, held out three fingers on each hand before beating his chest as fans rose to their feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Howard managed just seven points and six rebounds in Game 4 after getting into early foul trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He had no such problems on Tuesday night and had eclipsed his numbers in that game in the first quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>His work helped Houston outscore Los Angeles 64-46 in the paint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Clippers had cut the lead from 22 points to 13 late in the third quarter when Houston started intentionally fouling DeAndre Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They did it twice and he missed three of four before the Clippers returned the favor on Howard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Hack-A-Shaq stretch wasn't anywhere close to what it was in the last game when the Rockets did it time after time, giving Jordan 34 free throw attempts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He made just 14 of them on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Both teams also did it some in the fourth quarter on Tuesday, with Houston fouling Jordan and the Clippers doing it to Howard, Smith and Brewer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Four quick points by Howard gave the Rockets a 22-point lead with about seven minutes left in the third quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Jordan got his fourth foul soon after that, but coach Doc Rivers kept him on the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Clippers got going after that, using a 13-4 spurt to cut it to 83-70 with three minutes remaining in the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Griffin took over for Los Angeles in that span, scoring nine points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Ariza led Houston early in the third quarter, scoring eight points in a 12-7 run that pushed the lead to 75-55.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Los Angeles got within 2 with 3 1/2 minutes left in the first half when Hawes hit a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But Houston scored the next nine points to extend the lead to 57-46.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Griffin made a layup before the Rockets scored the last six points of the second quarter to make it 63-48 at halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The Rockets led 27-22 at the end of the first quarter after getting nine points and eight rebounds from Howard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Griffin on the chance to close out the series Thursday: ''They outplayed us and played like they wanted it ... we need to learn from this game and improve upon it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Clippers: Spencer Hawes came off the bench to score 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>... Jordan finished with 13 points and 11 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>... Rivers said he thinks Austin Rivers has a hip pointer after falling to the court hard late in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He said he'll know more about the injury on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Rockets: Rookie Clint Capela had eight points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He had a one-handed slam over Hawes early in the second quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>... The 36 points Houston scored in the second quarter were the most points they've scored in a quarter in this series.</td></tr>
