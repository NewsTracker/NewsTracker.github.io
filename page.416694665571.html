<h3>Nigeria's military brings first 275 children and women freed from Boko Haram to safety</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this photo made available by the Nigerian Military taken Tuesday, April 28, 2015, a pall of smoke hangs over an Islamic extremist camp, after it was allegedly destroyed by Nigerian military personnel during a attack on Islamic extremists in the Sambisa Forest, Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>YOLA, Nigeria - Their faces were gaunt, eyes infected, hair tinted orange and stomachs distended from malnutrition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They looked bewildered, lost, broken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the girls were alive and free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They were among a group of 275 children and women rescued from Boko Haram extremists, the first to arrive at a refugee camp Saturday after a three-day journey to safety, brought by Nigeria's military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They came from the Sambisa Forest, the last stronghold of the Islamic extremists, where the Nigerian military said it has rescued more than 677 girls and women and destroyed more than a dozen insurgent camps in the past week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Boko Haram killed the father of this child," Lami Musa told The Associated Press, cradling a four-day-old girl with black curls glistening with sweat in the 104-degrees Fahrenheit (40-degrees Celsius) heat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tears came to her eyes when she was asked if she has other children: "Three of them. Boko Haram killed my husband and grabbed me. I have no idea where my other children are."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She said she lost her family in an attack by the militants on her village of Lassa in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The baby was born the day before the group set off from the Sambisa for a refugee camp in Yola, the capital of Adamawa state, crammed into the backs of rickety, open pick-up trucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On the trip's first day, one military vehicle escorting the group exploded a landmine, wounding two soldiers, according to a soldier traveling with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Soldiers on foot then swept the road ahead of the convoy, he said, so it took three days to travel potholed roads for the 300 kilometers (200 miles) southwest to Yola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Musa, 27, could barely walk when they arrived, limping on feet swollen to massive size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said couldn't nurse her unnamed baby, because her breasts have no milk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She's among several dozen in the group taken first to the clinic at the refugee camp, set up in an unused boarding school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There, 22 were dispatched immediately to a hospital in town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dr. Mohammed Auwal said many were suffering from malaria, diarrhea and malnutrition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As night crept in, the camp is lit by a generator that powered the clinic and a bulb in a tree under which the military handed over the females to the National Emergency Management Agency at a brief ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>For nearly a year, Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan had been promising to bring home all the people kidnapped by Boko Haram home - especially 219 schoolgirls abducted from their boarding school in the town of Chibok.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That mass kidnapping a year ago outraged many around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It still was not clear Saturday whether any of the students who have come to be called "the Chibok girls" are among the newly freed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The military has spent days "processing" them and trying to identify them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Now they will get medical and psychological care to begin their rehabilitation, said Air Commodore Charles Otegbade, the emergency agency's director for search and rescue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The women were exhausted, too traumatized to realize they were safe, or be questioned about their experiences under Boko Haram.</td></tr>
