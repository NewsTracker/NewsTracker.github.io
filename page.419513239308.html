<h3>Las Cruces, New Mexico, sees heightened security in aftermath of church explosions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LAS CRUCES, N.M. - Heightened security persists in Las Cruces, where police and federal agents will sweep more than 100 churches for explosives this weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Officers have been sweeping churches each weekend since the Aug. 2 explosions at a Baptist and a Catholic church, reported the Albuquerque Journal (http://bit.ly/1NMyixV).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's just something we've got to do," said Las Cruces Police Chief Jaime Montoya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's something there is a dire need for, and we'll continue as long as we can."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Officers, federal agents and bomb-sniffing dogs will move unannounced from church to church this weekend, Montoya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They'll be travelling in teams of four looking for anything or anyone suspicious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Agents and officers from the FBI, Homeland Security, State Police, local police, New Mexico State University Police and Dona County Sheriff's Office are maintaining a presence Las Cruces, New Mexico's second-largest city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>No one was injured in the Aug. 2 blasts at Calvary Baptist Church and Holy Cross Catholic Church, but the force of the explosions sent shards flying, shattered a window and launched a mailbox nearly 200 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>No arrests have yet been made for those explosions or for the undetonated explosive device found at First Presbyterian Church on Aug. 14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Authorities believe the three cases may be connected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police detectives and federal agents brought together the three church leaders to discuss their positions on contentious topics, searching for a motive, Montoya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"That's the million-dollar question: motive," Montoya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"There has to be something, why someone or some people are targeting these churches. We were trying to find something really off-the-wall that would connect those two (Calvary and Holy Cross) and Presbyterian."</td></tr>
