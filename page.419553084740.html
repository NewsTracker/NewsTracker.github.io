<tr><td>3</td><td>MATENEH, Sierra Leone -- Health authorities in Sierra Leone released the country's last known Ebola patient from the hospital on Monday, a milestone that allows the nation to begin a 42-day countdown to being declared free of the virus that has killed nearly 4,000 people here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>President Ernest Bai Koroma presented a certificate of discharge to Adama Sankoh, 40, who contracted Ebola after her son died from the disease late last month.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>"Although my child died of Ebola I am very happy that I have survived today," she said upon leaving the Ebola treatment centre in Mateneh village on the outskirts of Makeni, the president's hometown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If Sierra Leone is declared free of transmission of the Ebola virus it would leave just one country with the disease -- Guinea -- after an epidemic that has killed more than 11,200 people since late 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But first Sierra Leone must go 42 days -- equal to two incubation periods of 21 days -- without another Ebola case in order for the World Health Organization to make such a declaration.</td></tr>
