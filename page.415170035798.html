<h3>Return of Crimea a must for mending ties with Russia, Ukraine says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>No normalization of ties between Ukraine and Russia is likely unless the region of Crimea, now under Russian control, is returned to Kiev's sovereignty, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Klimkin, on the second day of his two-day trip to Japan, also said the border between Ukraine and Russia needed to be completely closed to achieve any settlement to the armed conflict between Kiev and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He reiterated his government's stance as a ceasefire deal, reached last month in Minsk, is broadly holding on the front line, but fighters in the separatist stronghold of Donetsk are training for another round of clashes against government troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There could be no slightest way of normalizing or getting back to business in the relations between Ukraine and Russia without returning to status quo and establishing full Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea," Klimkin told reporters in Tokyo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The ultimate precondition for any effective, final settlement is to fully close down the Ukrainian-Russian border," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Because everything that has been destabilizing the situation in (the Ukrainian cities of) Donetsk and Lugansk - mercenaries, money, weapons, heavy weaponry, and of course Russian rebel troops - came through the Russian-Ukrainian border."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ukraine and Western governments have accused Russia of sending troops and weapons to support separatists in eastern Ukraine, despite the peace deal agreed on Feb. 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Moscow has denied this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We stress from the very beginning that we've been striving for a peaceful solution. But we will use any means for defending Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty," Klimkin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday that Moscow and pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine must implement the ceasefire or face "consequences" that could further hit Russia's faltering economy.</td></tr>

<h3>Upcoming Dragon Ball Movie Raises Its Power Level</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As shown in the latest trailer, it seems that Goku will have a hard time taking on Frieza this time around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As Frieza has been resurrected by his Planet Trade Organisation henchmen, Tagoma and Sorbet, he's also brought with him a veritable army to take on Goku and his friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Considering the last movie had Goku square off against an actual God, it will be interesting to see how Akira Toriyama will top that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Though from what I am seeing, this looks to be a pretty epic Dragon Ball movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>What's also especially nice to see is a cameo from Jaco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This is a new character that was given a recent standalone manga by Toriyama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One of the Galactic Police, he was original sent to Earth to deal with a Saiyan invader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As an aside, the manga is actually really quite good and is definitely one of Toriyama's better efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jaco is also an eminently likeable character and to see him involved in this new movie is great really.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This new movie is also shaping up to be a good one though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Toriyama has been quoted numerous times that he is really happy with his script and that bodes well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Frieza's new golden final form (shown above) is apparently meant to rival Goku's recent Super Saiyan God transformation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So seeing how that will resolve in terms of the narrative will be interesting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>What with the recently released Dragon Ball Xenoverse topping the Japanese charts as well as a new 3DS game on the way, the last few months have been very eventful for Dragon Ball fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This new movie feels like the icing on the cake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In any case the new trailer is shown below and the movie will be released across Japan in 2D, 3D and IMAX on April 18th.</td></tr>
