<h3>Oklahoma football players denounce Sigma Alpha Epsilon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>With the blessing of their coach, Bob Stoops, the players skipped practice Thursday to hold a silent protest against the bigotry tarnishing their school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I think this is bigger than practice and these guys have demonstrated that, and whether it makes us better or not is irrelevant in their eyes and in mine," said Stoops, who has lost at least one star high school recruit over the controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The team applauded the swift expulsion of Levi Pettit, 20, and Parker Rice, 19, who were filmed directing the bigoted song Saturday night on a Sigma Alpha Epsilon party bus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But they said more heads need to roll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The chant was not invented by the two that led it, but was taught to underclassmen by people of higher authority," reads a statement released by the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is our passionately expressed desire as members of the football team for the leadership of SAE to be expelled, suspended, or otherwise disciplined severely."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rice, a freshman, issued an apology, partly blaming alcohol consumption for the bigoted behavior and confirmed, "Yes, the song was taught to us..."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The SAE frat was booted from the Norman campus after the video surfaced of SAE frat brothers and their sorority guests singing about lynching and chanting the N-word.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>University President David Boren, who expelled Rice and Pettit on Tuesday, has vowed to discipline others once their identities are determined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Thursday Boren announced that Clark Stroud, Vice President of Student Affairs for the university, will investigate each individual officer of the fraternity to "determine their level of responsibility and to make recommendations on appropriate disciplinary action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The football team, including coach Stoops, staged a protest, marching arm-in-arm onto Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium dressed in black clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Once they reached the end zone, they fanned out across the field and held a moment of silence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Senior Ty Darlington, a white member of the team, said the controversy has "undeniably brought our team closer together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the player said racism is not an exclusive problem of the University of Oklahoma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"From personal experiences and from experiences of people around the nation, we know that this is a nationwide issue and that there are instances that happen like this every year. This one was caught on tape," Darlington said following the protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"This is our chance to use our platform as student athletes to promote a positive change around the nation," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Before we can change the whole nation, we want to change what's going on here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Stoops said he was proud of how his players have taken a unified stand against racism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It wasn't just thrown together," Stoops said of the players' protest and statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"These guys have put a lot of time into what the message is and how they can effect change and how they want to go about doing it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meanwhile, a lawyer familiar with the troubled history of the SAE fraternity nationwide blamed overall lack of oversight and a culture of secrecy for the scandal that has enveloped the University of Oklahoma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"There is a quantum lack of mature management of fraternities," said Douglas Fierberg, who represents the family of a Brooklyn student who was killed during a hazing event by Cornell University's SAE chapter in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"They manage and govern themselves, which means there is a tendency to get dangerously out of control," Fierberg told the Daily News on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Unlike campus dorms, which have paid adult staffers helping student leaders, fraternities are run almost exclusively by students, Fierberg noted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"So you have teenagers governing themselves behind closed doors," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"There's no balance check from someone without sworn allegiance to the fraternity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Fierberg represents the family of George Desdunes, who was found unconscious inside Cornell University's SAE house in February of 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The 19-year-old sophomore died after fraternity brothers bound his wrists and ankles with duct tape and zip ties and forced him to guzzle booze, according to a lawsuit the family filed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>After Desdunes' death, the Cornell officials suspended the frat until at least 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>SAE, which has roots in antebellum Alabama, was once named the nation's deadliest fraternity by Bloomberg News after nine people died at SAE events between 2006 and 2013 - more than any other fraternity in the country.</td></tr>

<h3>Obama Discusses Ferguson With Jimmy Kimmel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He said that protesters there had a legitimate right to be angry about their treatment at the hands of the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest," Mr. Obama said during an appearance on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"But there was no excuse for criminal acts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr. Obama cited the recent Justice Department report on Ferguson, which he said found a "whole structure" that indicated "both racism and just a disregard for what law enforcement is supposed to do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he repeated his belief that what happened in the Missouri city was "not unique, but it's also not the norm."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The president's comments about Ferguson came at a serious moment in an appearance on the late-night comedy show that also included references to Area 51, Hillary Rodham Clinton's email address and the question of whether Mr. Obama goes in search of late-night White House sandwiches in his underwear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>("I could. I don't," he said.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr. Obama helped Mr. Kimmel open the show by participating in a regular feature in which celebrities read mean Twitter posts that people have written about them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of the posts said, "Is there any way we could fly Obama to some golf course halfway around the world and just leave him there?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr. Obama grinned broadly when he read that one, and added, "I think that's a great idea."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Another post he read said: "How do you make Obama's eyes light up? Shine a flashlight in his ears."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After another post ended with "HaHa! LOL," Mr. Obama tried to channel his inner teenager, saying: "The LOL is redundant when you had the HaHa."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr. Kimmel introduced Mr. Obama as "the first Kenyan-born, Muslim socialist to be elected president," and he prodded him for details about his life inside the iron gates of the White House residence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr. Obama acknowledged that he had not cooked in a long time, and joked that he could not drive as president because "in Kenya we drive on the other side of the street."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Dental problems require only a trip to the White House basement, where Mr. Obama said there was a dentist chair set up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said he had staff members reset the clocks for daylight saving time, though he declined Mr. Kimmel's request to get rid of the time change altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This is a California thing," the president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"In the East Coast, you don't mind losing that hour because that's a signal that spring is here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He also declined to say whether he had spent the early part of his presidency digging through the files on Area 51, the military base in Nevada that has long been a source of conspiracy theories about U.F.O.s, for evidence of extraterrestrial life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I can't reveal anything," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When Mr. Kimmel told him that Bill Clinton had found nothing in the files, Mr. Obama added, "That's what we're instructed to say."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr. Obama briefly turned serious again when he used a question about campaign fund-raising to urge people to turn out to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And he briefly mentioned his "Student Aid Bill of Rights" that he announced this week to help students pay back their college loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But most of the appearance was a comedic warm-up to Mr. Kimmel's next guest, the actor Sean Penn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mr. Obama said that he and Mr. Penn talked in the green room before the show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Asked if he had seen Mr. Penn portray the iconic high school stoner in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," Mr. Obama laughed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I lived it," Mr. Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I didn't just see it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2015, on page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Obama Discusses Ferguson With Kimmel.</td></tr>
