<h3>Recent actions by the world's central banks, at a glance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In contrast, other big central banks are either cutting rates or embarking on stimulus programs to try to boost their struggling economies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Just this week, deteriorating conditions in Russia and South Korea led their central banks to announce rate cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Fed is moving toward raising its benchmark short-term rate from near zero, where it's kept it since 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Fed has been saying it will be "patient" in deciding when to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But policymakers will likely drop that word from the statement they will issue when their latest meeting ends next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Doing so would pave the way for a rate hike, possibly in June or September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Though the annual inflation rate remains below the Fed's target of 2 percent, the job market has continued to improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The unemployment rate has dropped to a seven-year low of 5.5 percent, and employers added a solid 295,000 jobs in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Russia's central bank cut its key rate Friday by 1 percentage point to 14 percent to try to energize the economy, which appears to be sliding into a brutal recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It was the second rate cut in as many months as officials reverse some of the sharp rate increases made in December " when they hiked them from 10.5 percent to 17 percent " to support a collapsing ruble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Higher rates tend to bolster a currency but hurt the economy by making borrowing more expensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The central bank predicts that Russia's economy will shrink by between 3.5 percent and 4 percent this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>India's central bank last week unexpectedly cut a key rate by a quarter percentage point, the second such reduction this year to lend support to government efforts to bolster the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The latest cut lowers the rate at which commercial banks can borrow from the Reserve Bank of India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>India's economic growth averaged about 8 percent a year in the decade ending in 2010 but slumped to about 5 percent in the following years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The move comes days after India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced in the new government's first annual budget that it would boost spending to try to jump-start Asia's third-largest economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>South Korea unexpectedly lowered its benchmark rate Thursday to a record low of 1.75 percent in an effort to revitalize sluggish economic growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The quarter percentage point cut was the first cut by the Bank of Korea in five months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The central bank said South Korea's economic growth and inflation this year will be lower than expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>There are also concerns that the country could fall into deflation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Interest rates: The European Central Bank kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.05 percent last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Other policies: The ECB has unleashed its 1.1 trillion euro ($1.2 trillion) stimulus program and said after its meeting last week that its actions were already boosting the eurozone economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The central bank raised its eurozone growth forecast for this year to 1.5 percent from 1.0 percent amid signs that credit is flowing more easily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On Monday, the ECB began buying 60 billion euros ($67 billion) a month in government and corporate bonds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The purchases, with newly printed money, are intended to lower borrowing rates, stimulate lending and growth and raise the inflation rate, which is dangerously low at minus 0.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Chinese authorities have generally been cautious in tweaking monetary policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But the People's Bank of China has lowered its benchmark rates twice since November to try to energize a decelerating economy and ward off a politically dangerous spike in joblessness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In February, the central bank cut the rate on a one-year loan by commercial banks by 0.25 percentage point to 5.35 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>China has set an economic growth target for this year of about 7 percent, which Premier Li Keqiang described as in line with efforts to create a "moderately prosperous society."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That's even slower than last year's growth of 7.4 percent, its weakest performance in nearly a quarter-century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The central bank is spending trillions of yen (tens of billions of dollars) a month on asset purchases, seeking to spur inflation and finally end the chronic deflation that has long hampered growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Government data this week showed that the world's third-largest economy escaped recession in the final quarter of 2014 but grew less than first estimated as demand and wages remained weak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Extreme monetary easing has been the linchpin of the "Abenomics" economic revival strategy, along with strong government spending and sweeping reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Brazil's central bank last week lifted its benchmark interest rate to 12.75 percent to try to control soaring prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The central bank's inflation target is 4.5 percent, with an upper limit of 6.5 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But consumer prices over the past year have been stuck above that ceiling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The rate hike is expected to further pressure South America's biggest economy, which is struggling to stay out of recession.</td></tr>

<h3>As Ferguson manhunt grinds on, leaders aim to defuse tension</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ferguson, Missouri: The hunt for suspects in the shooting of two police officers at a protest rally in Ferguson, Missouri, entered a second day on Friday as community leaders appealed for reconciliation and justice in a town struggling against a legacy of racial rancour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Law enforcement authorities were tight-lipped about any progress they may have made in tracking down whoever was responsible for wounding the officers during a volatile demonstration in front of police headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police said they rounded up several people on Thursday but released them after questioning without making any arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>So far authorities have scheduled no media briefings for Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Demonstrators protest in front of the police station on Wednesday night before two police were shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The vacuum of news on the manhunt kept the focus on efforts to ratchet down tensions that have spiked in the St Louis suburb since the attack early on Thursday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We can find these criminals who committed this heinous act," said Benjamin Crump, attorney for the family of Michael Brown, a black teenager killed by a white police officer in August, an event that made Ferguson a national symbol of strained relations between police and African-Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This can be an opportunity," Crump told CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The community and the police can come together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A police officer's helmet lies on the ground splashed with blood in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was one of two officers shot on Thursday morning in the troubled Missouri city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thursday's shooting took place a week after the release of a US Justice Department report that appeared to vindicate long-standing complaints of pervasive racial bias leveled against Ferguson's mostly white police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The report, initiated after Brown's death, led to the resignation this week of the city's police chief and other officials, but demonstrations, such as the rally where the two officers were shot, have persisted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Activists have pressed for more reforms to address what the report called a "toxic environment" for the city's mostly African-American residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chaunte Williams, 13, holds up three candles as she takes part in a vigil on Thursday in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>President Barack Obama said such protests were warranted in the light of events in the city but said whoever shot the police officials must be brought to justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest," he said during an appearance on the ABC program Jimmy Kimmel Live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"But there was no excuse for criminal acts, and whoever fired those shots shouldn't detract from the issue. They're criminals. They need to be arrested," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The shooting of the officers followed by less than three months the killing of two New York City patrolmen by a troubled man who said he was seeking to avenge the deaths of Brown and an unarmed black man in New York killed by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Activists, condemning the wounding of the officers, held a candle-light prayer vigil for peace in Ferguson late on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>About 100 people then held a boisterous but peaceful protest outside the police station in light rain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The crowd blocked traffic at times but there were no arrests and the demonstration passed without incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In Thursday's shooting, a 41-year-old St Louis County police officer suffered a shoulder wound and a 32-year-old colleague from the nearby Webster Groves Police Department was shot through his right cheek that left a bullet lodged near his ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Both were treated and released by a local hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Crime Stoppers, a nationwide organisation that works to prevent and solve crimes, has offered a $US10,000 ($13,098) reward for information leading to the culprit, and two Missouri Congressmen have added $US3000 ($3929).</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference on Thursday that muzzle flashes were detected about 115 metres away from the rally, where earlier fist-fights had broken out among some of those in the crowd.</td></tr>
