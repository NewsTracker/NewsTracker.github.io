<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BEIRUT, March 31 (Reuters) - Islamic State fighters killed at least 37 people in a Syrian village near the city of Hama overnight, a group monitoring the war said, part of a pattern of attacks by the ultra-radical force in government-held areas of western Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Syrian state television put the number killed at 44 and said 21 others had been wounded in the attack on Mabouja, a 60-km (40 mile) drive east of Hama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A Syrian military source said the army had repelled the assault on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which uses a network of contacts to monitor the four-year-old civil war, said Islamic State fighters had killed entire families and the dead included people who had been burnt to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The population includes Alawites and Ismailis -- sects deemed heretical by the puritanical Sunni Islam espoused by Islamic State, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Observatory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Alawites, Ismailis and Sunni residents were among the dead, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The area is some 200 km from Raqqa -- the de facto capital of the Islamic State's self-declared caliphate that spans territory in both Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is part of the western region where Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has sought to shore up his control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Assad, an Alawite, enjoys backing among many members of Syrian minority communities who fear hardline Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Islamic State fighters have mounted numerous attacks in government-held areas in the provinces of Hama and Homs in recent weeks, even as it has lost ground in the north and northeast under pressure from a Kurdish militia backed by U.S.-led air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The military source said: "Daesh tried to attack the village, and this attack was repelled, and a large number of Daesh terrorists were killed. And now the Syrian army is imposing its control over the village."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Daesh is an Arabic name for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Daesh is making a lot of attempts (to advance) east of Hama. It is trying a lot in that area, particularly after its loss in Shaar field," he said, referring to a gas field in Homs province reclaimed by the government in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Islamic State has been moving westwards across Syria and fighters say they plan to take Salamiya, a town east of Hama city before taking control of the provincial capital itself.</td></tr>
