<h3>Greek municipalities outraged by state move to use funds</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - Authorities from municipalities across Greece will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday after the government ordered reserves from state enterprises to be placed in a common account to help the country meet its financial obligations and avoid default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Following an emergency decree, funds from anything from hospitals to local government will be made available for short-term loans to the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis said his municipality would argue the decree was unconstitutional, while other mayors have told local media they are considering appealing the order in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Opposition parties have expressed outrage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The move is the latest sign that Greece is running perilously short of cash amid a dispute with its international creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Athens Stock Exchange general index tumbled 3.1 percent in afternoon trading.</td></tr>
