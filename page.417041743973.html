<h3>Britons Morrison and Howell lead way as Sergio surges</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BARCELONA, May 16 (Reuters) - Britons James Morrison and David Howell both overcame double-bogeys to share the lead after the third round of the Spanish Open on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Morrison carded a four-under 68 on another day of blustery weather at the Real Club de Golf El Prat on the outskirts of Barcelona to join Howell (69) on seven-under 209.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Italian Francesco Molinari was two strokes adrift in third spot after shooting a 70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>World number seven Sergio Garcia, the highest-ranked player in the field, fired a 67 for 214 and is on the fringes of title contention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After taking a seven at the par-five second, Morrison found his rhythm with seven birdies but also dropped another shot on the 17th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's been three very silly days. The first day I was three over after five holes and today I made a seven out of nowhere and fought my way back again," the former Madeira Islands Open champion told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It takes one good shot to get back into it. I've done that all week."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Fellow Englishman Howell had a double-bogey five at the eighth, along with two bogeys, but also picked up seven birdies in his round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'm delighted to be in the mix again," said five-times European Tour winner Howell.</td></tr>
