<h3>After Tikrit victory, Iraq's new challenge: Win over Sunnis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iraq won the battle to retake the city of Tikrit from the Islamic State group, backed by a coalition of the unlikely in Iranian advisers, Shiite militias and U.S.-led airstrikes, but the country now faces what could be its most important battle: Winning the support of the Sunni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraq won the battle to retake the city of Tikrit from the Islamic State group, backed by a coalition of the unlikely in Iranian advisers, Shiite militias, and U.S.-led airstrikes, but the country now faces what could be its most important battle: Winning the support of the Sunni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sunni tribes played a key role during the U.S. occupation fighting back al-Qaida in Iraq, the Islamic State group's predecessor, and their distrust of Baghdad's Shiite-led government eased the extremists' takeover last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But as Tikrit now sits in ruins, still patrolled by fractious Shiite militias, the powerful Sunni tribes remain as distrustful as ever as further offensives in their heartland loom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government "needs those local tribes to secure the territory and hold the fort until government function is restored in these areas," said Sajad Jiyad, a senior researcher at al-Bayan Center for Studies and Planning in Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The government needs to make sure that everyone who fights today has a future in Iraq tomorrow - and not just to find a short-term military solution today and forget about them later."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sunni grievances mounted during the eight-year rule of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, widely seen as pursuing sectarian policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Al-Maliki responded to rising Sunni protests with a violent crackdown, further stirring dissent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>By December 2013, security forces withdrew from Ramadi after dismantling a protest camp, allowing Islamic State militants ultimately to take it over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When the Islamic State group swept across a third of Iraq last summer, many Sunnis initially greeted them as liberators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Analysts believe members of Saddam's outlawed Baath Party, stacked largely with Sunnis, also aided the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The few Sunni tribes that stood up against the Islamic State group have paid a heavy price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In the Salahuddin town of Duluiyah, a mass grave holds the remains of 150 people from the al-Jabour tribe, killed by the militants in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The militants also killed more than 200 men, women and children from the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe in Anbar province in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The mass killings offered a stark warning to others considering aiding the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>With Tikrit taken, Sunni residents in Islamic State-held Anbar province, home to Fallujah, and Nineveh province, home to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, expect the Iraqi offensive to now turn its attention to their regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But many remain fearful of both the Islamic State group, as well as the Shiite militias involved in the Iraqi offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The government-backed Popular Mobilization Forces, comprised mainly of Shiite militias, have been a driving force in most of the successful battles against the militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But little remains of those towns - with several human rights groups pointing to the militias as the culprits for that destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The powerful, Iranian-backed militias have been accused in the past of atrocities ranging from driving Sunni families from their homes, to kidnapping and, in some cases executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In Tikrit, fighting damaged many homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Access to electricity and water is sporadic and roads are cratered and impassable in some parts of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>While the government has blamed criminal gangs for loot, others have blamed the militiamen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"People in Mosul are less enthusiastic about the entry of ... the militias into the city now because the militias have been acting like those people in Daesh who looted the houses of Christians in Mosul," said Ali Mohammed Jassim, a teacher from Mosul now displaced in Kirkuk, who used an Arabic acronym for the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has called on security forces to halt looting and vandalism in Tikrit, promising a fund would be established to help residents return to Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He did not elaborate, but analysts say such a step is needed.</td></tr>
