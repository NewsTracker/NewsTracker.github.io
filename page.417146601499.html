<h3>Rockets' Howard unsure if he can play in Game 2 vs Warriors (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OAKLAND, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard has a sprained left knee and is unsure whether he'll be able to play against Golden State in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Howard sat out practice Wednesday at Oracle Arena after an MRI confirmed the injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said his knee was still in pain and he'll listen to his body before deciding whether to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He added that he has ''no doubt'' he'll return at some point in the series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''The most important thing is that I'm healthy,'' Howard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''Nobody can understand an injury when they're injured but the person that's injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This is going to be on how I feel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If I feel like I can tolerate it and go out there and play on it, then I will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But my career is the most important thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Howard hurt his knee in a first-quarter collision with teammate Josh Smith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He came back into the game in the second quarter but lacked his usual athleticism and eventually left with less than a minute into the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Howard finished with seven points and 13 rebounds in 26 minutes on the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Warriors beat the Rockets 110-106 to open the best-of-seven series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''It was very painful to play (Tuesday) night, and coach just felt like it was best that I sit out the rest of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I tried to play on it, but it's really nothing I could do,'' Howard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Howard missed 41 of 82 games this season, mostly due to issues with his right knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said the latest injury is frustrating, especially this deep into the playoffs, and he's hoping for a fast recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''Just stay positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Don't allow any doubt or negativity to run through my mind,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''It was just a freak incident that happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If Howard can't play, the Rockets could turn to rookie Clint Capela as their starting center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Switzerland-born Capela, who also played in the NBA Development League this season, had nine points on 4-of-4 shooting and four rebounds in 13 minutes in Game 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Capela said he'll be ready if called upon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''I'm really just trying to focus on what I need to do on the floor,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Rockets coach Kevin McHale said Capela can be a contributor, but it'll take a team effort to fill Howard's role if necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''Clint's not going to turn into Dwight overnight,'' McHale said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''He might.</td></tr>
