<h3>Bali nine executions: Lawyers file last ditch appeal for Brazilian man on death row</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lawyers for Rodrigo Gularte have filed a last ditch appeal in the Administrative Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lawyers for a schizophrenic Brazilian man scheduled to be executed with the Bali nine pair on Tuesday night will file a last ditch appeal in the Administrative Court in a bid to save his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Rodrigo Gularte was arrested in 2004 trying to smuggle six kilograms of cocaine into Indonesia in surfboards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The nine death row inmates set to be executed on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Top row from left, Myuran Sukumaran, Andrew Chan, Serge Atlaoui and Rodrigo Gularte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bottom row from left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Raheem Agbaje Salami, Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, and Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Medical records obtained by his legal team reveal he was first diagnosed with cerebral dysrhythmia when he was 10 years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Six years later he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gularte talks to animals and is afraid of electromagnetic waves from satellites watching him above his prison on Nusakambangan island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Frenchman Serge Atlaoui was taken off the execution list just days ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His lawyer, Ricky Gunawan, lodged a request for a judicial review into his case on Monday and an appeal in the Administrative Court on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His legal team have 22 documents relating to his mental illness and are baffled that this was not brought up by his previous lawyers during Gularte's trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They will argue that Gularte should be hospitalised not executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Under article 44 of the criminal code, a person with a mental illness cannot be held responsible," Mr Gunawan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In 2014 the Brazilian Embassy requested Gularte be transferred to a mental institution but Indonesian authorities never responded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a statement, the Brazilian Embassy says it is "unacceptable" that Gularte be executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Nothing will be gained in the fight against drugs through this clearly inhumane act in the light of Indonesia's own laws and international laws," the statement says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo has said that according to testimonies from doctors and fellow prisoners Gularte is not sick at all and is fit to execute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But with just hours to go before the executions, Mr Gunawan still hopes he will be saved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He points to the fact Frenchman Serge Atlaoui was taken off the execution list just days ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told Fairfax Media it was because Atlaoui had an appeal before the administrative court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>As of Tuesday, Gularte will also have an appeal before the Administrative Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Serge has been excluded because of that. If the Attorney General's office still continues with the execution of Rodrigo it would be discriminatory," Mr Gunawan said.</td></tr>
