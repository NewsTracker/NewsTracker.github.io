<h3>Violence, arrests at protest over police-custody death in Baltimore</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE -- Thousands of protesters took to the streets to demand answers in the case of Freddie Gray, the largest rally since the 25-year-old black man died in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After hours of peaceful demonstrations, pockets of protesters smashed police car windows and storefronts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Saturday's protests came a day after Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis said Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested, before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the department's policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Grey died April 19 after suffering a fatal spinal injury while in custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His death has intensified a national debate over police treatment of African-Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Video showed him being dragged into a police van, and police have said he rode in it for about 30 minutes before paramedics were called.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Gray's death has been compared to those of other unarmed black men who died at the hands of police in New York City and Ferguson, Missouri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Residents voiced their anger Saturday at how the department and the city's officials are handling the investigation into Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Protesters threw cans and plastic bottles in the direction of police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One protester broke the window of a police cruiser, grabbed a police hat inside and wore it while standing on top of the cruiser with several other protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At least two people were hurt in the mayhem, and at least a dozen were arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In her first public comments since Gray's death, his twin sister, Fredricka Gray, appealed for calm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"My family wants to say, can you all please, please stop the violence?" she said at a news conference with the mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Freddie Gray would not want this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earlier Saturday, the crowd paused for a moment of silence in front of Shock Trauma, the hospital where Gray died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Signs in hand, with slogans such as "Jail Killer Police!" and "Unite Here!," demonstrators filled two city blocks and marched to City Hall, where the crowd overtook a grassy plaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tanya Peacher, a 36-year-old Baltimore resident, said she'd never attended a protest in the city before, but watching a video of Gray's arrest motivated her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At a downtown intersection, a dozen marchers laid down in the street during an impromptu "die-in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Both Commissioner Anthony Batts and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who took office in 2010, are African-American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They came in making promises to the inner-city residents and police who spent decades staring each other down in neighbourhoods ravaged by crack and heroin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But with each death of a black man in custody, their efforts to overcome mistrust have hit hard walls of skepticism and outrage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Batts says he's fired 50 police employees and reduced officer-involved shootings, and the use-of-force reports police must file dropped from 598 in 2012 to 435 in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But he acknowledged that some cases have "tarnished this badge and the reputation of the department."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Grey is at least the fifth black man to die after police encounters since Batts took charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A Baltimore Sun investigation revealed last year that the city has paid roughly $5.7 million in brutality settlements since 2011, involving 102 instances of excessive force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Batts then asked the U.S. Justice Department to review the department's policies and procedures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Now the Justice Department has opened a second probe, by its Civil Rights division, examining Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Baltimore had one of the nation's busiest markets for heroin and crack cocaine when Martin O'Malley ran for mayor in 1999.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The future Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate imposed a "zero tolerance" policy that did reduce crime, but it also resulted in thousands of arrests without cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In 2010, civil rights groups the ACLU and NAACP reached an $870,000 settlement with the city that required police to track their arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But by 2012, an independent auditor found Baltimore officers still couldn't justify 35 per cent of their arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Marchers block the Pratt Street after a march to City Hall for Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Saturday, April 25, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Protesters confront a patron outside of a bar across the street from Oriole Park at Camden Yards after a rally for Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Saturday, April 25, 2015.</td></tr>
