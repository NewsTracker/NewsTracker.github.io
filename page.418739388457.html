<h3>Guardado lifts Mexico past angry Panama, 2-1, in Gold Cup</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Panama's Erick Davis (15) is restrained as tempers flare during the second half of a CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer semifinal between Panama and Mexico on Wednesday, July 22, 2015, in Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mexico won 2-1 in extra time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ATLANTA (AP) - A night of conflict and controversy ended with referees surrounded by security and another win by Mexico surrounded by suspicion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Andres Guardado scored two goals on penalty kicks, including the tiebreaker in extra time, and six-time champion Mexico beat short-handed and angered Panama 2-1 in the Gold Cup semifinals Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Turmoil on the field incited fans - among the 70,511 at the Georgia Dome - to hurl drinks and other debris onto the field on two occasions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tensions rose after a foul was called on Panama's Roman Torres for touching the ball with his hand in the penalty area late in the second half when Panama was protecting a 1-0 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There was a delay as cups were thrown from the stands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Players from both teams argued on the sideline and appeared to be on the verge of an all-out melee before being separated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The call set up Guardado's first penalty kick in stoppage time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Panama coach Hernan Gomez called it a "stolen goal" and said he was left with "immense sadness."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I ask myself why did this happen?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gomez said through a translator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We were doing everything well. It is very sad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We are people of football and I still can't believe this happened and I wonder if this really happened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mexico will play Jamaica in the final Sunday in Philadelphia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Jamaica upset defending champion United States 2-1 in the first semifinal and will be appearing in its first final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This is not the ideal situation," Mexico coach Miguel Herrera said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It wasn't the ideal way to win."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Panama's Roman Torres scored on a header early in the second half, and the 1-0 lead held until Guardado's penalty kick in stoppage time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The penalty kick, which followed a 10-minute delay as tempers flared, set up the extra time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Panama played at a disadvantage after forward Luis Tejada drew a red card and was ejected for his contact with Mexico's Francisco Rodriguez about 25 minutes into the match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Similar controversy surrounded Mexico's 1-0 win over Costa Rica in the quarterfinals Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The win came on Guardado's penalty kick in the final minute of extra time after Roy Miller was called for a questionable foul on Oribe Peralta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We didn't produce football," Herrera said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We had nothing to do with that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Panama was denied its second straight final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It lost to the U.S. in the 2013 final after beating Mexico in the semifinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A win by Panama's win would have been an upset, but not on the level of Jamaica's shocker over the U.S. Mexico is No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>40 in the world rankings and has appeared in seven of 12 finals in the CONCACAF tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Panama is 62nd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A header by Torres early in the second half broke the scoreless tie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Torres was in position to intercept a corner kick from Erick Davis in front of the goal, and his header to the ground bounced past goal keeper Guillermo Ochoa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Torres jumped in glee, his fists clinched, as Panama took its fifth straight 1-0 lead in the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>In each of its first four games, Panama took 1-0 leads only to allow the equalizer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>This time, its defense held firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In the 25th minute, Tejada jumped to attempt a header when he hit Rodriguez with his arm and hand, knocking the defender to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Tejada protested and had to be restrained by his teammates when the red card was pulled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>There was tension from both teams as Mexico players pushed Panama's players away from Rodriguez, who remained on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Tejada was very slow to leave the field, stopping and circling back as fans hurled cups and plastic bottles in his direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Tejada's teammate Adolfo Machado attempted to serve as an escort off the field but finally gave up when Tejada continued to linger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Finally, Tejada departed into the tunnel, leaving Panama with the difficult task of taking on Mexico with 10 players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Mexico's Miguel Layun cleared the debris from the field, picking up the cups and bottles, so play could resume.</td></tr>
