<h3>Father tells jury about boy's death at Boston Marathon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tsarnaev is charged with conspiring with his brother to place two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line in April 2013, killing three and injuring 260 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boston Marathon bombing survivor Rebekah Gregory, right, and an unidentified woman arrive outside federal court, Thursday, March 5, 2015, in Boston, during the federal death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is charged with conspiring with his brother to place two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line that killed three and injured 260 people in April 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FILE - In this April 15, 2013, file photo, Emergency Medical Services EMT Paul Mitchell, left, Carlos Arredondo, center, and Devin Wang, rear, push Jeff Bauman in a wheelchair after he was injured in one of two explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Opening statements are scheduled Wednesday, March 4, 2015, in the federal death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for allegedly conspiring with his brother to place twin bombs near the finish line of the race, killing three and injuring 260 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In this courtroom sketch, Boston Marathon bombing survivor Jeff Bauman is depicted while testifying in the federal death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Thursday, March 5, 2015, in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bauman lost both legs in one of the blasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>BOSTON (AP) - With Dzhokhar Tsarnaev seated at the defense table no more than 15 feet away Thursday, the father of an 8-year-old boy killed in the Boston Marathon bombing described the moment when he looked down at his son's pale, torn body and realized he wouldn't make it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I saw a little boy who had his body severely damaged by an explosion," Bill Richard told the jury, "and I just knew from what I saw that there was no chance, the color of his skin, and so on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Martin Richard was one of three people killed in the bombing near the finish line of the race on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The boy's younger sister, 6-year-old Jane, had a leg blown off, while their older brother, Henry, suffered minor injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Their father, testifying at Tsarnaev's federal death penalty trial, spoke in a slow, halting voice but remained largely composed as he described the chaos and confusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said he scooped Jane up in one arm and took Henry in the other and "tried to shield both of their eyes" from the carnage around them as he took them away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Richard took the stand as federal prosecutors continued trying to drive home the consequences of the attack in such heartbreaking detail that Tsarnaev's lawyers objected - and were overruled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tsarnaev, 21, showed no reaction to the testimony and appeared to look straight ahead, not making eye contact with Richard, who sat off to the side in the witness box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some of the women on the jury appeared to wince at times during his testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Spectators in the courtroom could be heard crying quietly, including Rebekah Gregory, who lost a leg in the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As Richard testified, the jury watched a video of the father rushing to help his children and a grievously wounded Jane struggling to get up, only to fall down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A prosecutor showed Richard a photo and circled a face - a young man in a white baseball cap worn backward- who could be seen just a few feet behind Jane and Martin as the youngsters stood on a metal barricade, watching the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It was Tsarnaev, shortly before the two pressure-cooker bombs went off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Richard said he himself suffered shrapnel injuries, burns on his legs and two perforated eardrums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>His wife, Denise, was blinded in one eye and had other injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Earlier Thursday, Roseann Sdoia testified that she saw two flashes of white light at her feet near the finish line, looked down, and for a split second thought to herself: I'm wearing strappy sandals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She quickly realized she was looking at her foot dangling from her mangled leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Someone came running over to me and told me I had to get out of there. I told them I couldn't get up. I didn't have a leg," a sobbing Sdoia told the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>She walked to the witness stand on an artificial leg, plainly visible below the hemline of her skirt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sdoia, who was at the race as a spectator, said she saw wounded people all around her, including someone covered with soot, dazed and "walking around like a zombie."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Prosecutors also showed the jury a grisly photo of her shredded leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyer has admitted the former college student took part in the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But in a bid to save Tsarnaev from a death sentence, she argued that he was influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a getaway attempt days after the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Also Thursday, Jeff Bauman - who lost both legs in the attack and was photographed being wheeled away that day in one of the most widely seen images of the tragedy - testified that he locked eyes with one of the bombers shortly before the twin blasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"He was alone. He wasn't watching the race," said Bauman, who walked slowly into court on two prosthetic legs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I looked at him, and he just kind of looked down at me. I just thought it was odd."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Later, from his hospital bed, Bauman remembered the man's face clearly enough to give the FBI a description of someone authorities say turned out to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Before testimony began Thursday, Tsarnaev's lawyers complained to the judge that the survivors' testimony from the previous day went into too much detail about the effect on their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>They said that kind of testimony should be reserved for the punishment phase of the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. said the testimony did not go too far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The trial resumes Monday.</td></tr>

<h3>Families blocked from seeing Bali nine pair on execution island</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bali nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have spent three lonely days at Nusakambangan, with their families so far blocked from visiting them on the penal island where Indonesia's government plans to execute them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Refusing to show any latitude to the emotionally battered families, Indonesian officials are saying they can only see the pair between 9am and 1pm on Mondays and Wednesdays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Australian consular staff are negotiating for some leniency but the head of the Central Java justice office, Mirza Zukarnain, said there could be no compromise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An anti-drugs protester in Cilacap prays in front of an effigy of a drug smuggler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"No exception. We can't make allowances for certain families only. It won't be fair for the others," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The standoff comes as Indonesian President Joko Widodo insisted there were "no problems" with its relationship with Australia, despite outrage at the extraordinary military and police operation to transfer the reformed drug smugglers to Nusakambagan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are still good friends, good neighbours but the death penalty is our legal sovereignty," Mr Joko told reporters in East Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Julian McMahon and Australian consul-general Majell Hind board the ferry at Wijaya Pura port in Cilacap headed for Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop described the "disproportionate" transfer of Chan and Sukumaran and the release of photos showing them with a smiling Bali police chief as "undignified and degrading" on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It seems that our citizens have been singled out for treatment designed to maximise publicity that was certainly at odds with the treatment of other citizens of other countries in the same position," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dozens of heavily armed police and military personnel accompanied Chan and Sukumaran during the transfer, while hundreds more secured roads and airports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sukhoi fighters jets shadowed the plane that carried them from Bali to Central Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Other drug felons due to be executed were transferred in a far more low key fashion, often in just a single prison van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A spokesman for the Indonesian attorney general, Tony Spontana, defended the militarised operation, saying it was required "to ensure a smooth transfer".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Foreign Affairs deputy secretary Greg Moriarty, who was Australia's ambassador in Jakarta until last year, spoke with ambassador Nadjib Riphat Kesoema on Thursday night to register Australia's displeasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ms Bishop intends to meet with the ambassador next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells on Besi prison, or Iron prison, one of seven jails on Nusakambagan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They are incarcerated in separate cells but can call out to each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They have no contact with other inmates at the prison other than Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, who is also due to be executed by firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Friday morning, the men's lawyer, Julian McMahon, and Australia's consul-general to Bali, Majell Hind, pushed through a frenzied media mob and anti-drugs protesters to board the ferry to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Demonstrators carried a grisly post wrapped in sheets with a face scrawled with coloured pen, to resemble a corpse wrapped in a traditional Muslim shroud for burial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The demonstrators urged that the Australians be shot, carried signs such as "We love Indonesia. Save Indonesia generation" and "Go to hell".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They marched to the ferry dock singing the Indonesian national anthem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The scenes came as Indonesia flagged a delay in the execution of Chan, Sukumaran and eight others slated to be killed alongside them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The length of the delay remains uncertain, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The pause should give the Bali nine duo's lawyers time to pursue a legal appeal lodged on Monday with the state administrative court in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The action is the second attempt to challenge the rejection of Bali nine drug smugglers clemency pleas by Mr Joko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Lawyers for the pair say Mr Joko rebuffed Chan and Sukumaran's petition for mercy without properly considering their specific circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With the guidance of prison staff, the pair transformed Kerobokan penitentiary in Bali into a model of rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>On December 9 last year, Mr Joko said: "The clemency requests are not on my table yet. But I guarantee that there will be no clemency for convicts who committed narcotics-related crimes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mr Spontana, said "we have to respect the ongoing legal process", a reversal of the position of the attorney-general HM Prasetyo elucidated as recently as Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He has maintained repeatedly that a rejection of a clemency application nullified any future legal redress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>All of the ten drug offenders due to be executed have seen their pleas for clemency rejected by Mr Joko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Even so, five of the condemned 10 have legal appeals in the works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>One of the death row drug felons, Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, had her case before the courts on Tuesday before it was adjourned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It was not immediately unclear if Mr Spontana was talking about all the legal appeals or just the Veloso matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Confusion, contradiction and delay have been a regular feature of Indonesia's handling of the executions in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"There could be other reasons for the delay [but] I hope, in my heart, that it's a change of mind," Ms Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Retno Marsudi, stressed on Friday that Indonesia was determined to "maintain good relationship with Australia, with all countries".</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>She said a United Nations account of a human rights dialogue quoting Indonesian diplomats saying that the country could introduce a moratorium on the death penalty was a misrepresentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"We protested because we never stated it and the uploaded version from the Office of the UN Human Rights High Commissioner has been revised in accordance to what was stated by the Indonesian delegation," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>At the time of writing, the UN had not changed the document.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Ms Retno also insisted that the Indonesian ambassador in Canberra had not been called in to DFAT for a rebuke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Bali police spokesman Hery Wiyanto has revealed that an investigation will be launched into the media leak of a photo of a smiling Denpasar police chief with his arm on Chan's shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Mr Hery said Senior Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo did not violate any rules and would not be investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"It wasn't a selfie moment, it wasn't a pose," Mr Hery said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"He was talking to and encouraging the boys."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>However, he said intelligence officers and the internal affairs division of the police force were investigating who took the photo and how it reached the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Disciplinary action would be taken if the investigation discovered the photo had been sold to the media.</td></tr>
