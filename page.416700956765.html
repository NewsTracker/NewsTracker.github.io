<tr><td>47</td><td>Others wore T-shirts that read, "Black Lives Matter," a slogan many have taken up in the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The Gray case is the latest in a string of high-profile killings of black men by police that include Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City, neither of which resulted in charges against the lawmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Unlike Brown and Garner, Gray's death happened in a majority black city where black elected officials hold the reins of political power and oversee the justice system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The police department is 48 percent black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Even the officers charged are racially split - three white, three black.</td></tr>

<tr><td>55</td><td>As of 11 p.m. on Saturday, a handful of people had been arrested, including one that was hit with a blast of pepper spray and later taken away in an ambulance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Mosby said in charging the officers that police had no reason to stop or chase after Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>They falsely accused him of having an illegal switchblade when it was a legal pocketknife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>The van driver and the other officers failed to strap him down with a seat belt, a direct violation of department policy, and they ignored Gray's repeated pleas for medical attention, even rerouting the van to pick up another passenger, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Mosby said Gray's neck was broken because he was handcuffed, shackled and placed head-first into a police van, where he was left to slam against the walls of the small metal compartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>She deemed the death a homicide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>The Gray case has brought to the forefront problems that have festered in Baltimore for more than a half-century: poverty, crumbling infrastructure, joblessness, racial tension, and neighborhoods plagued by neglect, drugs, violence and a heavy police presence, and prompted repeated refrains of "Black Lives Matter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>The reverberations through the streets of Baltimore have extended far past its borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Protests have swept across Philadelphia, Austin, Dallas, Boston and New York in response to Gray's death and the cities' own tense relationships with their police forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>In Baltimore, before the racially and economically diverse crowd in City Hall plaza, Black Lawyers for Justice president Malik Shabazz praised Mosby for her decision, and called on the citizens of Baltimore to protect her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>"Every prosecutor should have such backbone," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>"Every prosecutor should have such spine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>"We've always got the cuffs on us," he continued, "now the real criminals have the cuffs on them. Make sure no harm comes to this black woman who is prosecuting these police officers, because if any harm comes to this prosecutor while she is prosecuting this case we will hold Baltimore and America thoroughly accountable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>As Shabazz's amplified criticisms of the police echoed off nearby buildings, heavily armed officers and national guardsmen stood cross-armed near armored vehicles barricading the streets surrounding the plaza and peering at protesters through binoculars from their perch on a nearby rooftop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>A police helicopter circled high above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Earlier in the day, demonstrators gathered in Sandtown, the poor, predominantly black West Baltimore neighborhood where Gray was raised and arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Among the throng was Kweisi Mfume, the former congressman and president of the NAACP, who said the charges are a response to the passion and fury of young Baltimore residents.</td></tr>
