<h3>World Health Organization approves 1st quick test for Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit, made by Colorado-based Corgenix, met sufficient quality, safety and performance requirements to allow it to be purchased and distributed by U.N. agencies and aid groups, WHO said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It may definitely help the response. I wouldn't say it's a game-changer," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO's assistant director-general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Until now, Ebola tests have been mainly conducted in laboratories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>These gene-based tests are more accurate but can take between 12 and 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new test can provide results within 15 minutes by detecting an Ebola protein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In trials it correctly identified 92 percent of the patients with Ebola and 85 percent of those not infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Medical personnel will still need to conduct a backup test when someone tests negative, said Aylward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"But (the new test) might help us get to zero faster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Almost 24,000 people have been infected and nearly 9,400 people have died from the current Ebola outbreak, which began in West Africa over a year ago.</td></tr>

<h3>Father, stepmom charged in case of Detroit boy found in basement</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>on Friday, June 27, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>DETROIT -- Prosecutors on Friday brought torture and child abuse charges against the father and stepmother of a 12-year-old Detroit boy who was found in his father's basement last year after an 11-day disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Wayne County prosecutor's said Charlie Bothuell IV and Monique Dillard-Bothuell systematically physically abused the child, forced him to live in the basement and didn't allow him to socialize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a statement, prosecutors said the boy, Charlie Bothuell V, was deprived of food and forced to engage in an "extreme and unreasonable exercise regime."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The father and stepmother earlier denied any abuse took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The state Department of Human Services has said the father acknowledged striking his son with a PVC pipe, and said in a court filing last year that the boy told authorities he was forced to rise before dawn for intense workouts of 100 pushups and even more situps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Detroit police arrested the Bothuells on Friday morning, the prosecutor's office said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They have each been charged with one count of torture, punishable by up to life in prison, and second-degree child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are thankful that the victim was found alive," prosecutor Kym Worthy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is the first time that the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office has charged torture for a living child. Based upon the allegations, if any case warrants child torture charges, this one certainly does."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with a lawyer who represented Charlie Bothuell IV in a custody case where Michigan has been seeking to terminate the couple's rights to two other children and the father's rights to Charlie Bothuell V.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They're due in court on Friday afternoon.</td></tr>
