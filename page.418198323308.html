<h3>Facebookâ€™s New Logo: Can You Spot the Difference?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook tweaked its logo Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new logo is on the right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blink and you'll miss the tweak Facebook is making to its logo Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The letters are thinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There's more white space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The "a" is rounded off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, the update subtly hints at a much larger shift within the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is actually a huge change and it's much more than the 'a,' " said Howard Belk, co-chief executive and chief creative officer of Siegel+Gale, a branding firm that's part of Omnicom Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's driven by mobile."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Facebook's old logo was created in 2005 when the then-nascent social network was anxious to find its footing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The result: a strong, squared-off typeface well-suited for desktops and designed to look grown up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Since then, Facebook has evolved from scrappy startup to sprawling public company that also operates mobile apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Now that we are established, we set out to modernize the logo to make it feel more friendly and approachable," Facebook creative director Josh Higgins said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The tweaks also reflect the growing importance of smartphone users to Facebook's bottom line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Facebook's new logo loses some of its old character, but it's more smartphone friendly, Belk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The back-lit glow of a smartphone makes letters look fuzzy and less legible, so clear lettering with more white space looks better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Belk said his firm advises clients to adapt their branding to where people will see it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"More and more, it's in the palm of their hands," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>About 1.44 billion people visit Facebook every month, increasingly from mobile phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the first quarter, 87% of the social network's monthly active users checked Facebook from their phones, up from 79% the year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In 2014, mobile advertising revenue accounted for about 65% of Facebook's total ad revenue, up from 45% in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Facebook is updating its corporate logo throughout its offices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The "f" logo in the upper corner of Facebook's website - known as the favicon - will be unchanged.</td></tr>
