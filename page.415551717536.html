<h3>Dallas Seavey wins third Iditarod sled dog race in 4 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Seavey came in under the city's famous burled arch finish line to wild applause from fans lining the street, some who poured out of the bars that stayed open into the wee hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An exhausted Seavey, who also won the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 2012 and 2014, petted and hugged his dogs after their victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It takes a whole team to get any of us here," he told reporters at a finish line ceremony, which was broadcast and live-streamed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Later, he hoisted two of his dogs onto his lap and officials draped the animals with garlands of yellow flowers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"As long as you take care of the dog team (and) make good decisions, good things will happen. Wins are a result of doing what we love," Seavey said, adding that he tried to keep the race fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said he and his father, Mitch Seavey, who won titles in 2013 and 2004, encouraged each other along the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The elder Seavey was in second place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dallas Seavey increasingly put distance between himself and the rest of the field during the latter part of the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He held a 25-mile advantage early Tuesday - a far cry from how he won the race last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was running third in the 2014 Iditarod when a freak snowstorm blew the leaders out of the race, and Seavey didn't know he had won the race until a cameraman broke the news to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Seavey was presented Wednesday with $70,000 and the keys to a new pickup truck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The winner's purse increased this year, and the top prize was $19,600 more than what he pocketed for last year's race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I'm pretty tired right about now - it's been a tough race," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The cold zaps you. The dogs, they're very lively, but it takes a lot of effort to keep them well-fed, keep them rocking and rolling. This is a hard dog team to keep up with."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Aaron Burmeister was running in third place, while Jessie Royer and Aliy Zirkle were battling for fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Royer and Zirkle each had attempted to become the first woman to win the race since the late Susan Butcher won her fourth title in 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Poor weather south of the Alaska Range this year forced the official start farther north to Fairbanks, on the northern side of the mountains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Not much snow fell south of the range, and officials said the conditions in the normally treacherous Dalzell Gorge were made even more dangerous by a lack of snow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That's the location where many mushers crashed their sleds in 2014, causing many to scratch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A new race route also was created, with much of it run on river ice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The new route allowed new communities to serve as checkpoints, including the Athabascan community of Huslia, famed for its sprint sled dog races.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The ceremonial start in Anchorage went on as planned on March 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Snow had to be trucked in so mushers could navigate paved streets, but there was little snow elsewhere in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The snow brought in for the race barely lasted the few hours it was needed because of temperatures nearing 40 degrees and rain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A total of 78 mushers began the race March 9 in Fairbanks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Eight scratched, and one was disqualified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Two dogs have died in this year's race, including one that was hit by a car after getting loose during the ceremonial start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The other dog that died was on the team of four-time champion Lance Mackey.</td></tr>

<h3>Nigeria's military: No news of 219 kidnapped Chibok girls as jets bomb Boko Haram stronghold</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The admission of lack of progress on the missing schoolgirls comes as the Nigerian military, bolstered by forces from neighboring countries, is regaining towns and cities held by Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The military's successes come as Nigeria prepares for a critical presidential election on March 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Other kidnap victims have escaped and some have been freed by the militants, but there has been not a whisper about the girls whose mass abduction spawned the #BringBackOurGirls campaign and provoked protests around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"No news ?for now because in all the liberated areas we have, we have also made enquiries, but the truth is, when the terrorists are running away, they run also with their families," army chief Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minimah told reporters on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are optimistic that ... we will get further details on them" as Boko Haram's area of influence shrinks, Minimah said in Abuja, Nigeria's capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The military this week "liberated completely" the two northeastern states of Yobe and Adamawa from the extremists, said Minimah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said Boko Haram now holds only three of 27 local government areas in Borno, the third northeastern state under a military state of emergency and the birthplace of Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Monday, the military said it had recaptured Bama, the second city of Borno state, as it prepares a final assault against the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The victories, after years of failure, follow an offensive launched at the end of January by troops from Chad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Despite the lack of news on the schoolgirls, Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan, currently campaigning for re-election in a tight race against former military dictator Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, has repeated promises to bring the girls back alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I am more hopeful now than before on the Chibok girls," Jonathan told a televised media chat on Feb. 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But unconfirmed reports indicate that many of the schoolgirls may have been forced into marriage with their captors, some carried across Nigeria's borders and at least three died early on from snakebites and untreated malaria and other ailments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However Jonathan says he remains optimistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I believe that the story of the Chibok girls will be better, now that we are working with Niger, Cameroon and Chad," he said, referring to a new regional army of 8,750 troops to fight Boko Haram as the militants carry their conflict over Nigeria's borders in their bid to recreate an ancient Islamic caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>More than 1.5 million people driven from their homes by Boko Haram's nearly 6-year-old Islamic uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some 10,000 people were killed in the uprising just last year, according to the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some 276 girls were snatched before dawn from the government boarding school in Chibok on April 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dozens escaped in the first couple of days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But 219 remain missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A spate of recent suicide bombings carried out by young women and girls has raised fears that Boko Haram is using kidnap victims to increase its deadly toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In videos, Boko Haram's leader has said that girls should be married off, not educated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The group's nickname means "Western education is sinful."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In early February, Nigeria's air force began bombarding the Sambisa Forest, a stronghold of Boko Haram where the Chibok girls first were taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Last year, the military said it could not bomb the forest or launch a ground offensive for fear the girls would be harmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Are these girls going to be collateral damage? It is very, very sad," said Hussain Monguno, a community leader in the Borno-Yobe People's Forum told The Associated Press after the bombing started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"As the days go by, the possibility of getting them back becomes very bleak."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Restless nights have been the lot of the Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Enoch Mark, a pastor with the Church of the Brethren whose two daughters are among the kidnapped girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He said he is in hiding because he has become a wanted man by Boko Haram because of his role as a spokesman for parents of the Chibok girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I have been spending the nights sleeplessly worrying about what condition my daughters might be in," Mark told AP by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I am so disturbed, thinking of my daughters, thinking of the other Chibok girls."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Associated Press writers Bashir Adigun and Chika Oduah contributed to this report from Abuja, Nigeria.</td></tr>
