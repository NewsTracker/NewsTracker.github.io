<h3>Ukraine's grinding war stains innocence of childhood</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Like many 7-year-olds in eastern Ukraine, he has trouble recalling a time before the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"They've always been shooting," he says, vigorously scratching with the brightest of pencils.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yelena Nikulenko, the director of the children's home in the rebel-held town of Khartsyzk, says kids like Seryozha have been let down twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>First orphaned or abandoned by their parents, they were then dumped by their new families when the Ukrainian government stopped paying benefits to foster families in separatist-controlled areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"On top of that, you have the war, the shelling, the fear," Nikulenko says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It will be a scar for the rest of their lives, that's for sure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The conflict that erupted in Ukraine last year between government troops and Russian-backed separatists has claimed at least 6,000 lives and displaced nearly 1.8 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The United Nations Children's Fund estimates that 1.7 million children on both sides of the front line have been harmed through lack of proper shelter, nutrition, medicine or schooling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Children struggle to understand what is going on around them, and why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fighting has abated drastically since a new cease-fire came into effect last month, but the suffering, loneliness and terror remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the government-held town of Popasna, 70 kilometers (45 miles) north of the children's home, only a few people walk along deserted streets between apartments gutted by rocket fire, a grim contrast to the days when the town bustled with 30,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One of those destroyed homes belongs to Tatyana Belash, who has now taken shelter in a basement with her 3-year old daughter, Zlata.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As the adults talk politics, Zlata, a shy girl with blonde pigtails, darts around the basement cluttered with battered mattresses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Asked about the shelling, Zlata shies away and seeks comfort in stroking her cat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"When we first came here, she kept saying: 'Let's go home!'" Belash says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I couldn't explain to her that we couldn't go home because there was fighting going on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Children in the Ukraine-controlled village of Chermalyk play war and scuttle in and out of the craters made by falling Grad rockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As 11-year old Tolik Tokar shimmies into one crater, his head disappears from view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Then he raises his head and pretends to shoot at the baddies: the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The boys take aim with make-believe guns fashioned from sticks - but Tokar has seen shooting first-hand, not just in play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"When shelling was raging, we went to check it out, and then they opened fire on me," Tokar says, stammering as he tells his tale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The bullets tore through the cloth on my shoulder here and flew past."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A few dozen kilometers away on the rebel side, children play the same games - but with roles reversed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There, Ukrainian soldiers are the bogeymen, with "Nazi" one of the favorite slurs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The 22 children under Nikulenko's tutelage, in Khartsyzk, are some of the most vulnerable anywhere in the war-wracked region, and she asks that they be identified only by their first names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Before fighting began, the home served as a shelter for children rescued from the streets, or seeking respite from dysfunctional families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>More have been abandoned in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Veronika, a freckled and gap-toothed 6-year-old, smiles and pulls down on her red-checked dress as she recalls life before the war - the visits to the amusement park and zoo, her mother's home cooking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She even has fond memories of her father, who returned home after a stint in prison for slashing her mother's shoulder with a knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Since then, her father enlisted with the rebel army and her mother left her at the children's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Veronika relies on her own inner strength to ward off the terror brought on by war.</td></tr>
