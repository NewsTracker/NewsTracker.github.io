<h3>First Draft: Hillary Clinton to Start Airing Ads in Iowa and New Hampshire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton will begin a $2 million television advertising buy in Iowa and New Hampshire on Tuesday, an effort that her campaign aides say is aimed at defining her candidacy ahead of a crush of Republican attack ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The twin sixty-second spots that Mrs. Clinton's campaign will air - one called "Dorothy," the other "Family Strong" - are biographical ads that depict the former secretary of state as a fighter, a theme her advisers have sought to elevate, who will fight for voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The spots also will begin airing at a moment of political anxiety for some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters, as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reconsiders a presidential campaign of his own after the death of his oldest son, Beau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr. Biden's potential to be a strong challenger, in part because of the strengths he honed as a campaigner on behalf of President Obama in 2012, is of concern to some of Mrs. Clinton's allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The footage for the spots was shot two months ago, her aides said, well before Mr. Biden resumed considering a run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mrs. Clinton's advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the considerations of their strategy, said they had always planned a summer ad buy ahead of an autumn in which Republican "super PACs" are expected to dominate the airwaves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The timing is similar to what Mrs. Clinton did in her 2008 presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But in that August 2007 television ad buy, Mrs. Clinton used her first campaign ad to attack outgoing President George W. Bush for treating working families and soldiers as "invisible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This time, the ads are gauzy narratives telling the story of Mrs. Clinton's late mother, Dorothy Rodham, whose working-class childhood is omnipresent in the candidate's campaign speeches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The ads also focus on Mrs. Clinton's own curriculum vitae.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Whatever the motivation in terms of timing, the ads will reinforce a point to which Mrs. Clinton's advisers often point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As her "honest and trustworthy" poll numbers have fallen recently, her advisers believe she will fare well when voters are asked the question about whether a candidate cares about people like them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We're going to make sure everyone knows who Hillary Clinton really is - who she fights for and what has motivated her lifelong commitment to children and families," Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Since Day One, we've planned for a competitive primary with Hillary herself working to earn every vote and, ultimately, the nomination. This is the natural next step."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mrs. Clinton's aides had previously reserved air time for the fall, in order to lock in cheaper rates before too many reservations are made, given the number of Republican candidates running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The "Dorothy" spot features Mrs. Clinton speaking directly to the camera about her mother, who was abandoned as a child by her parents and was helped to survive by people around her, including teachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"She went to work in somebody else's home at age 14 and it opened her eyes," Mrs. Clinton says in the ad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"For the first time she saw parents who loved and cared for their children. And that's the kind of loving family she provided for us. When she needed a champion, someone was there. I think about all the Dorothys all over America who fight for their families, who never give up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She adds, "That's why I'm doing this. That's why I've always done this. For all the Dorothys."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the second ad, "Family Strong," Mrs. Clinton again cites her mother as her chief inspiration, before a narrator describes her work at the Children's Defense Fund, and her efforts focusing on children's health and education both as first lady of Arkansas and the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"You probably know the rest," the narrator says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The senator who made sure the heroes and families of 9/11 got the care they needed. The secretary of state who joined the cabinet of the man who defeated her, because when your President calls you serve."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The narrator ads, "And now a new title: grandma."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mrs. Clinton ends the spot referring to families, saying, "It's your time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The reference could also be a nod to women voters in terms of the chance to elect the first female president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Clinton campaign's November ad reservation is still in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mrs. Clinton's aides said they knew that August air time was relatively open, meaning they didn't need to book well in advance and that doing so could have risked Republican groups or candidates buying time themselves to drown out her message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The reservations for the air time had not yet been booked, according to a television ad buyer for a rival to Mrs. Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But the spots that start on Tuesday will air statewide in New Hampshire, where Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has closed the gap with Mrs. Clinton in recent polls, and in two large markets in Iowa, her aides said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>We send out a newsletter around 7 a.m. eastern time each weekday that serves as a look-ahead to the day's political events and expected stories.</td></tr>
