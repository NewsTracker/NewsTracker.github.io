<h3>CIA bought Iraqi chemical weapons say US officials</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The CIA, working with United States troops during the occupation of Iraq, repeatedly purchased nerve-agent rockets from a secretive Iraqi seller, part of a previously undisclosed effort to ensure that old chemical weapons remaining in Iraq did not fall into the hands of terrorists or militant groups, according to current and former US officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The extraordinary arms purchase plan, known as Operation Avarice, began in 2005 and continued into 2006, and the US military deemed it a non-proliferation success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It led the US to acquire and destroy at least 400 Borak rockets, one of the internationally condemned chemical weapons that Saddam Hussein's Baathist government manufactured in the 1980s but that were not accounted for by UN inspections mandated after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The effort was run out of the CIA station in Baghdad in collaboration with the Army's 203rd Military Intelligence Battalion and teams of chemical-defence and explosive ordnance disposal troops, officials and veterans of the units said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many rockets were in poor condition and some were empty or held a liquid, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But others contained the nerve agent sarin, which analysis showed to be purer than the intelligence community had expected given the age of the stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A New York Times investigation published in October found that the military had recovered thousands of old chemical warheads and shells in Iraq and that Americans and Iraqis had been wounded by them, but the government kept much of this information secret.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>These munitions were remnants of an Iraqi special weapons program that was abandoned long before the 2003 invasion and that turned up sporadically during the US occupation in buried caches, as part of improvised bombs or on black markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The potency of sarin samples from the purchases, as well as tightly held assessments about risks the munitions posed, buttresses veterans' claims that during the war the military did not share important intelligence about battlefield perils with those at risk or maintain an adequate medical system for treating victims of chemical exposure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The purchases were made from a sole Iraqi source, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The amount of money that the US paid for the rockets is not publicly known, and neither are the affiliations of the seller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Most of the officials and veterans who spoke about the program did so anonymously because, they said, the details remain classified.</td></tr>
