<h3>In Tech: Microsoft Office comes to Android, Foursquare brings back mayors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This product image provided by Microsoft shows the new PowerPoint app for Android devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Android versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint are now available in the Google store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Android phone owners can now use an updated version of Microsoft's Office tools for writing, spreadsheets and slideshows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps are designed to provide more functions on small touchscreens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Microsoft released them for Android phones this week in another move to make some of its most popular software tools available to people who don't use Microsoft's Windows operating system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company had released redesigned versions for Android tablets in January and for iPhones and iPads last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Android phone users had only a bare-bones version, except through a limited "preview" of the expanded offering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>(Of course, Android device owners have also been able to use competing tools from Google and other app-makers.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There are still no comparable apps for phones and tablets running Microsoft's own Windows system, though that will change once Windows 10 gets released next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As Android phones have had until now, Windows phones get only the bare-bones Office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Windows tablet owners have to use a version more suited for laptops and desktops with real keyboards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The mobile apps are free, although Microsoft is offering more features to users with an Office 365 subscription, which starts at $70 a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Microsoft says some phone makers including Samsung, Sony and LG will ship Android phones with Office already installed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The new apps will work on older phones running the KitKat version of Android from 2013 and Lollipop from last year, but nothing older than that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For a certain subset of people, life started to have meaning again this week, when the startup Foursquare announced that its location-sharing app Swarm is bringing back mayorships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Come again?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Foursquare, you see, was an app that allowed users to "check in" to bars, restaurants and other places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>You became the "mayor" of a place if you checked in more than anyone else in a given period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There were fierce competitions for mayorships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While Foursquare's user base stayed small, many users were fiercely loyal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In 2014, with user growth stalling and competitors like Yelp eclipsing it, Foursquare split itself into two apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Foursquare became the place for people to discover businesses and venues around them, while the social features migrated to a new app called Swarm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At Swarm, you can check in to places and share this information with your Swarm buddies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Swarm app also let users compete for mayorships, but only among their friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>This, Foursquare said, "just wasn't as much fun."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>So in a blog post, Foursquare said it was "upping the ante and letting you compete for mayorships against everyone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>-- Facebook is now letting people sign up for its Messenger app even if they don't have a Facebook account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It's another way the world's biggest online social network is spreading its tentacles over your phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>This option is available in the U.S., Canada, Peru and Venezuela.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>-- Instagram is creeping on Twitter and Periscope territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The photo-sharing app announced this week that it wants to let users "see the world as it happens."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It's revamping its "Explore" page to help users discover events while they happen, from concerts to sports events to sunsets on the Santa Cruz boardwalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It's also made it easier to search for people, places and tags -- at the same time, if you'd like.</td></tr>
