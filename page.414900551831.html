<h3>Britain and E.U. ?Sleepwalked? Into Ukraine Crisis, Lawmakers? Report Says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For too long, the European Union's relationship with Moscow had been predicated on the "optimistic premise" that Russia was becoming a democratic, law-abiding country, the report said, rendering member nations insensitive to the degree of Russian hostility toward European Union efforts to negotiate a closer political and economic relationship, known as an "association agreement," with Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>European states "have been slow to reappraise the relationship and to adapt to the realities of the Russia we have today," the report said, and lack a long-term strategic response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The analytical failure and "glaring absence of political oversight" was compounded by a decline in Russia expertise and analysis in Britain and across the European Union, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"A loss of collective analytical capacity has weakened member states' ability to read the political shifts in Russia and to offer an authoritative response," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The report concluded that the European Union had failed to appreciate "the exceptional nature" of Ukraine and its relationship to a more aggressive Russia in Mr. Putin's latest term as president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Britain failed to live up to its obligations in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which it signed with Russia, the United States and Ukraine, guaranteeing Ukraine's territorial integrity and offering security "assurances" in return for Kiev's renouncing its extensive nuclear arsenal, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The U.K. had a particular responsibility towards the country, and it has not been as active or as visible as it could have been," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While the policy of the United States was not a direct topic for the report, the same criticism was implicit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Russia, said that the "misreading" of Ukraine applied to the United States as well as to Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The report was prepared over nine months by the European Union external affairs subcommittee of the House of Lords and overseen by Christopher Tugendhat, a former member of the European Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The report sharply criticizes Russia and the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, and it recommends further Western economic sanctions in response to the fighting, which has continued despite another cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Further European sanctions should follow Washington's practice of targeting those close to Mr. Putin as opposed to middle-ranking officials in Crimea, the report said, and the European Union should consider extending sanctions into the Russian financial sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Britain, it said, should stage an international donor conference in London for Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A Foreign Office official said that no one could have predicted the Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The blame lies squarely with the pro-Russian separatists, backed by the Russian authorities, not with an association agreement between the E.U. and Ukraine which had been under negotiation for more than seven years," she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, as is Foreign Office practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was about a year ago that demonstrations in support of closer ties to the European Union culminated in the revolution in Kiev that led to the flight to Russia of the Ukrainian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That was soon followed by the seizure of Crimea by Russian forces and a separatist push in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, occupied by the election campaign before a vote on May 7, has been criticized as a bystander in the Ukraine crisis and did not go to Minsk, Belarus, last week for talks with Mr. Putin, President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Francois Hollande of France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Britain has said that it does not approve of providing defensive arms to Ukraine now, a position repeated on Thursday in Madrid by the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr. Tugendhat said on Friday that because the West would not fight in Ukraine, it must not raise false hopes there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"They do need to get on with the Russians themselves," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But the defense secretary, Michael Fallon, warned this week that Mr. Putin presented "a real and present danger" to the three Baltic nations and thus to NATO itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He said Russia was now "as much a threat to Europe as Islamic State," and spoke as British fighter jets were scrambled for the second time in a month to escort Russian bombers off the coast of Cornwall, England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Despite the stronger tone, Britain has been sharply reducing its military budget, with more cuts expected in the next Parliament, prompting warnings about Britain's ability to play a serious role in global affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>This month, the Defense Select Committee of the House of Commons sharply criticized Britain for playing a "strikingly modest" role in the coalition battle against the Islamic State, noting that Britain had carried out only 6 percent of coalition airstrikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The committee, led by Rory Stewart, a member of Parliament from Mr. Cameron's Conservative Party, criticized the prime minister and the armed forces for failing "to set out a clear military strategy" for Britain and for neglecting to use accumulated British knowledge about Iraq despite "the most significant threat" to international stability to emerge from the Middle East in decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The committee found that Britain had only three military personnel outside the Kurdish region of Iraq compared with 400 Australians, 280 Italians and 300 Spaniards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A projection by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a British think tank, from the government's fall budget statement says that military spending could be cut further by 36 percent in real terms in the next Parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on February 21, 2015, on page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Britain and Europe 'Sleepwalked' Into the Ukraine Crisis, Report Says.</td></tr>

<h3>Troubled Ukraine marks year since protest bloodbath in Kiev</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"When a person wants to give everything and devote himself to something, as did the Heavenly Hundred, it can't be for nothing," he said, referring to the term that Ukrainians have adopted for those who died during months of protests in 2013-14 that led to the ouster of Ukraine's Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The grisliest day was a year ago Friday, when more than 50 people were killed by sniper fire on the capital's main square, known as Maidan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Various sources count the total number of Heavenly Hundreds as somewhere between 110 and 123.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It includes those who died in earlier clashes with police as well as opposition supporters who died in beatings or mysterious circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Friday evening, Ukraine's current pro-Europe president, Petro Poroshenko, spoke at a gathering of thousands on the square to commemorate the dead and echoed the belief that their deaths were not pointless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We will stop the war and after a few years everyone will see how Ukraine has changed; we feel with every cell how the people demand that change be accelerated," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He vowed to fight the "fear, panic and mistrust" that he said "a neighboring state" was trying to sow in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Heated, contradictory allegations still surround the question of who fired the shots on Feb. 20, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Protesters and their supporters assert that the bullets came from rifles held by Ukrainian police or Russian marksmen to try to definitively put down the demonstrations against Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Their detractors allege radicals within the protest movement were responsible, purportedly willing to slaughter their own people to drive the political crisis to a breaking point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Poroshenko on Friday claimed Ukraine has evidence that Vladislav Surkov, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's advisers, organized the snipers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected the claim as "ravings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Whatever the intent, the gunfire helped force chaotic change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The day after the killings, European Union envoys put heavy pressure on Yanukovych and opposition leaders to sign a pact that would allow Yanukovych to stay in power for a few months, but call early elections and make constitutional changes that would weaken his power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But hours after the pact was signed, Yanukovych vanished from view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He surfaced the next day in one of his political strongholds in eastern Ukraine and then disappeared again until he turned up in Russia, where he eventually bitterly abandoned any claim to still being president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It was a coup, shouted his partisans in the heavily ethnic Russian east and south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Within a few weeks, Russian troops solidified their presence on Crimea and citizens on the peninsula voted to secede in a hastily called and legally questionable referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A month later, armed separatists began seizing buildings in the mainland east, sparking a war with government troops that has killed more than 5,600 people and persists despite two internationally mediated cease-fires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>As the violence in eastern Ukraine slogs on, the question of who fired the shots a year ago has fallen into the shadows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk expressed expectations that the Interior Ministry and Prosecutor General would present a full report on their investigation by the end of the week, but by Friday afternoon there was nothing forthcoming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Three suspects, members of the Ukrainian security service, were arrested last year, but one was released on bail and disappeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>What remains are the memories of those who were on the square terrifying day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The trade union building that had been turned into an opposition encampment had been gutted by fire and the air was filled with vile smoke from piles of tires set afire to deter police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I was very impressed when I came to Maidan on February 20th. It looked like hell," said Zastavnyi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Zastavnyi suffered bullet wounds in the stomach and one arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Trying to escape, he was shot a third time in the leg, which doctors eventually amputated.</td></tr>
