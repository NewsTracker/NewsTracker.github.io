<tr><td>5</td><td>As first lady to President Bill Clinton during the 1990s, she was a driving figure in a failed health care overhaul and lived through the tumult of multiple ethics investigations and the trauma of her husband's impeachment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She rebounded, winning a Senate seat representing New York in 2000, then embarked on a 2008 Democratic presidential bid that faltered against Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After Obama won the White House, Clinton joined his administration, serving for four years as his secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If successful, she'd be the first woman to achieve a major-party nomination and the presidency.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>She quickly asserted herself as her husband's adviser after he won the White House in 1992.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both Clintons were a lightning rod for the right during the White Hours years; in the Senate, she struck a bipartisan tone at times - an approach expected to be seen in her 2016 campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Her Senate vote for the 2002 Iraq invasion became a point of contention in 2008 with nomination rival Obama, who spoke out against the "dumb war" at the time.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>As first lady, Clinton declared in a speech to the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women that "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The speech challenged human rights abuses of women and helped set the tone for Clinton's work years later in the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Her 2008 speech, delivered after Obama locked up the nomination, told supporters they had made "18 million cracks" in the glass ceiling, denoting the number of primary votes she won.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>While they faced large legal bills from the Whitewater investigation, the couple made millions after Bill Clinton's presidency and the comments were considered tone-deaf.</td></tr>
