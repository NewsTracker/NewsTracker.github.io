<h3>Fairfax CEO calls on Greece to remove uncertainty, clinch debt deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Fairfax CEO calls on Greece to remove uncertainty, clinch debt deal Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The head of Fairfax Financial Holdings, which bet on the success of a turnaround in Greece last year, urged the country to reach a deal with its counterparts in the euro zone on Friday and remain a part of the currency bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"My message is get a deal done, as removing uncertainty for Greece will be a major positive and it will drive a recovery in the Greek economy," Prem Watsa, the chief executive of Fairfax and a well known contrarian investor, told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fairfax last year became a key player in the bailout of one of Greece's largest lenders, Eurobank Ergasias, after it bought a 13.6 per cent stake in the bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Toronto-based firm in April boosted its position in the bank further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The comments from Watsa, who spoke in a phone interview, came as the European Central Bank expanded emergency funding to keep Greek banks on their feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A steady flow of withdrawals from the banks continued on Friday ahead of a key summit next week that could decide whether Greece can stay in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Watsa said he conveyed the message about getting a deal done and removing uncertainty in a meeting a few weeks ago with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said Tsipras was receptive and encouraged Fairfax's investments in Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The two sides are working at cross purposes today, with the Greek government looking at what's good for Greece and the Troika looking at what's good for them," said Watsa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Eventually there'll be a deal, because there has to be one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Fairfax has also bet on two other Greek companies, building positions in real estate investment company Grivalia Properties and Greek industrial group Mytilineos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Both have seen their shares hit by uncertainty around a Greek debt deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Even if a deal fails to materialize, Watsa said Fairfax is well positioned to weather the storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Greece, whatever the situation, will need a good banking system," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Grivalia has got some of the best buildings in Greece with some great long-term tenants. Greece is not going to go away."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Our exposure to Greece is very manageable ... We don't see this as being too much of a concern," said Watsa, whose bet in 2011 on a turnaround in the fortunes of the Bank of Ireland paid off handsomely.</td></tr>
