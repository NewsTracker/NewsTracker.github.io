<tr><td>87</td><td>The governor declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to restore order - but authorities were still struggling to quell pockets of unrest after midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>The violence, which began in West Baltimore - within a mile of where Freddie Gray was arrested and pushed into a police van earlier this month - had by the end of the day spread to East Baltimore and neighborhoods close to downtown and near the baseball stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in her first day on the job, said she would send Justice Department officials to the city in coming days.</td></tr>

<tr><td>91</td><td>At least 15 officers were hurt, including six who remained hospitalized late Monday, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Two dozen people were arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>Officers wearing helmets and wielding shields occasionally used pepper spray to keep the rioters back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>For the most part, though, they relied on line formations to keep protesters at bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>Monday's riot was the latest flare-up over the mysterious death of Freddie Gray, whose fatal encounter with officers came amid the national debate over police use of force, especially when black suspects are involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>Gray was African-American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Police have declined to specify the races of the six officers involved in his arrest, all of whom have been suspended with pay while they are under investigation.</td></tr>

<tr><td>110</td><td>Glass and trash littered the streets, and other small fires were scattered about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>One person from a church tried to shout something from a megaphone as two cars burned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>"Too many people have spent generations building up this city for it to be destroyed by thugs, who in a very senseless way, are trying to tear down what so many have fought for, tearing down businesses, tearing down and destroying property, things that we know will impact our community for years," said Rawlings-Blake, a lifelong resident of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>Police urged parents to locate their children and bring them home.</td></tr>

<tr><td>118</td><td>Later in the day, people began looting clothing and other items from stores at the mall, which became unprotected as police moved away from the area.</td></tr>

<tr><td>120</td><td>Downtown Baltimore, the Inner Harbor tourist attractions and the city's baseball and football stadiums are nearly 4 miles away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>While the violence had not yet reached City Hall and the Camden Yards area, the Orioles canceled Monday's game for safety precautions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>On Monday night, Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings and about 200 others, including ministers and mostly men, marched arm-in-arm through a neighborhood littered with broken glass, flattened aluminum cans and other debris, in an attempt to help calm the violent outbursts.</td></tr>
