<h3>Harper uses patriotic themed bat, homers to help Nats win (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seems like every bat Bryce Harper uses this season provides fireworks for the Washington Nationals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The patriotic version he used on July 4 against Madison Bumgarner and the San Francisco Giants was no exception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Harper homered, Tyler Moore drove in four runs and the Washington Nationals defeated the San Francisco Giants 9-3 on Saturday despite Stephen Strasburg exiting in the fourth inning with tightness in his left side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The bat was painted blue with white stars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was also illustrated with the American flag and a silhouette of the D.C. skyline, including the Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument - all in navy blue and white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I had it in the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I went back there today and I was like, why not,'' Harper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''I might get in trouble swinging it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>So be it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>I thought it was pretty cool, pretty patriotic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rain delayed the game's scheduled first pitch by 19 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Washington's offense got to Madison Bumgarner (8-5) quickly with four consecutive hits including home runs by Michael A. Taylor and Harper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was aware his special bat probably wouldn't meet Major League Baseball regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I might get a call or a letter or something like that, maybe a warning,'' Harper continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''It's a one day kind of thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I think it's pretty cool to be able to do stuff like that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Guys have (personalized) cleats and batting gloves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Including Friday's 2-1 victory, the Nationals opened the series with consecutive wins after losing two straight in Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The defending World Series champion Giants have lost five straight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The top of Washington's lineup had their bats working from the start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Taylor drilled the first pitch of the game from Bumgarner just over the left field wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The second pitch barely stayed in the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Yunel Escobar's fly ball smacked off the wall in center for a double.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Washington went up 3-0 three pitches later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The lefty-swinging Harper turned on a fastball for his 25th home run of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Bumgarner allowed a single to Wilson Ramos before recording his first out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He surrendered a season-high six runs and eight hits in five innings plus two batters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The 2014 World Series MVP had not allowed more than two runs in any of his previous four starts, but went 1-2 in that stretch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''He just got ambushed,'' Giants manager Bruce Bochy said of Bumgarner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Moore also had three hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Tanner Roark (4-3) earned the win after pitching 4 1/3 innings in relief of Strasburg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Strasburg allowed one hit over 3 2/3 scoreless innings in his third start since coming off the disabled list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The right-hander previously missed nearly four weeks due to neck tightness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He winced and grabbed in the area of his left side after making an attempt at Buster Posey's groundball out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Strasburg walked off the mound and into the dugout following a lengthy conversation with Nationals manager Matt Williams and a team trainer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''It's pretty tight,'' Strasburg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''Don't really have an explanation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Everything felt pretty good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>I just threw a pitch to Posey there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Roark allowed five hits and two runs for the NL East-leading Nationals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Brandon Crawford, Gregor Blanco and Brandon Belt had RBIs for San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Washington's numerous injuries has led to Williams using Moore and other reserves extensively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Moore's RBI double off Bumgarner in the fourth scored Washington's fourth run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Another two-base hit drove in two in the sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Moore added an RBI single during a three-run seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Giants: OF Angel Pagan is expected to play Sunday after being out of the starting lineup for the second time in three games, Bochy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>He reportedly dealt with a swollen left knee during the previous series against Miami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Nationals: Strasburg went 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA and 15 strikeouts in his previous two starts since returning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Giants: RHP Ryan Vogelsong (6-6, 4.19) went 2-4 with a 4.11 ERA over six starts in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Nationals: RHP Jordan Zimmermann (6-5, 3.16) faces the Giants for the first time since allowing one run over 8 2/3 innings in Game 2 of their NLDS matchup last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Washington lost 2-1 in 18 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Giants outfielder Ryan Lollis, 28, went 0 for 4 with a strikeout in his major league debut.</td></tr>
