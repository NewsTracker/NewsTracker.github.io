<tr><td>4</td><td>The Patriots were fined $1 million and docked two draft picks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Owner Robert Kraft said the team would accept the punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Brady, a four-time Super Bowl champion and the face of the most successful NFL franchise of this century, has denied cheating.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>But Goodell plans to hear the appeal himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Troy Vincent, the league's executive vice president of football operations, issued the suspension to Brady.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The three-time Super Bowl MVP has hired attorney Jeffrey Kessler, who has taken on the league in a variety of other cases through the years, and could take his case to court should his punishment not be reduced after appeal.</td></tr>
