<h3>Blood clots again sideline NASCAR driver Brian Vickers (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Brian Vickers has been sidelined again by blood clots that prevent him from safely driving a race car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Vickers' third bout with blood clots was announced Friday by Michael Waltrip Racing, which replaced him with Brett Moffitt for Sunday's NASCAR race at Auto Club Speedway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''We support Brian,'' said Michael Waltrip, the team founder and co-owner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''We love his heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 31-year-old driver must go back on blood-thinning medication, which makes it too dangerous to race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If Vickers got injured in the car, any bleeding would be difficult or impossible to stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''He's in the care of his doctors and expects to be able to operate normally today,'' Waltrip said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''That's really all the information I have on what his current state is, other than he feels really good and he's really sad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''If he wasn't a race car driver, you wouldn't know there was an issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Waltrip and Vickers were in New Orleans together on Wednesday for a sponsor event before traveling Thursday to the Los Angeles area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>MWR general manager Ty Norris learned of Vickers' condition early Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''He's getting the right treatment,'' Norris said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Norris declined to say where Vickers' blood clots were located.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Waltrip's team has only preliminary information about Vickers' condition, but the driver is in the care of doctors in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Moffitt will return to the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>55 Toyota this weekend after driving it to an impressive eighth-place finish at Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although Vickers has been sidelined by medical issues for the fourth time in his NASCAR tenure, Waltrip wouldn't speculate on whether Vickers' racing career is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''He would not say that, and therefore I can't say that,'' Waltrip said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Vickers missed the first two races of this year following offseason heart surgery to repair a patch on a hole in his heart that his body was rejecting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The heart issue was first discovered in 2010 when Vickers was sidelined with his first bout with blood clots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The blood clots caused Vickers to miss the final five races of the 2013 season because he was placed on blood thinners to treat a clot in his right calf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He also missed 25 races during the 2010 season when clots were discovered in his legs and lungs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>After his December heart surgery kept him out of the car for two weeks, Vickers returned to racing two weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He was 15th at Las Vegas in his return, but was involved in a crash on the first lap at Phoenix last week and finished 41st.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''Thankfully, because I recognized the signs and symptoms, the doctors caught this early and I'm going to be OK,'' Vickers said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''I had finished my treatment for the clot I had in my leg back in 2013 and I haven't needed to be on a blood thinner for a clot in my leg or lung since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Now I won't be able to race because I'll need to be back on a blood thinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Vickers also noted that his latest setback is occurring during ''Blood Clot Awareness Month.'' He was scheduled to help promote the issue at Fontana with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, one of his partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Moffitt had been scheduled to drive this weekend for Front Row Motorsports, a ride he landed after his impressive stint for Vickers at Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Front Row needed a driver to step in for David Ragan, who is replacing the injured Kyle Busch at Joe Gibbs Racing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Moffitt was 37th at Las Vegas and 32nd at Phoenix for Front Row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The MWR development driver was using the Front Row opportunity to get seat time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Chris Buescher will take over for Moffitt at Fontana, making his Sprint Cup Series debut in Front Row's No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>34 Ford.</td></tr>

<h3>Where are all the glasses? Thousands unable to enjoy the eclipse after shops fail to stock enough special eyewear?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As the country prepared for the solar eclipse, advice on how to safely watch it was rife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With primary schools refusing pupils permission to view it and the rest of the public urged to buy appropriate eyewear, many were left desperately searching for the elusive eclipse glasses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But with just one day to go before the spectacle swept the UK, thousands of people were left at a loss yesterday when nowhere seemed to be selling them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>None of the country's main supermarket chains were stocking the glasses and dedicated websites had long sold out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Eclipseglasses.co.uk shut up shop last week after being snowed under with orders while other online prices soared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sky at Night, the BBC's science magazine, was offering a free pair with every copy of its March issue that costs 7.99, but shoppers were otherwise left no choice but to scour the web for sets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Its editor Chris Bramley said staff were 'stunned' by the overwhelming demand for sets, with the magazine printing an extra 10,000 copies in preparation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'We did anticipate some extra activity but we were stunned by the level of interest in the event, we increased our print run by an extra 10,000 copies and it sold out,' he told MailOnline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'We even had two customers come to the office in Bristol to collect the copies and glasses by hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Bramley added he was surprised the glasses weren't available in more places with so many people taking an interest in the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'It's such a specialist subject but really there is this groundswell of interest in science and astronomy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Amazon and eBay were selling the glasses individually and in bulk, with prices ranging from 20 a pair to 50 for ten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Many complained about the shortage, claiming more were available at the last eclipse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But experts said in neither 1999 nor 2015 were retailers enthusiastic about the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>David Burder of 3D Images Ltd, which stocked the BBC magazine with glasses ahead of this year's eclipse, said it was a 'pity' more shops weren't involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'If shops over-order then they're going to be left with stock they can't sell - it's only useful for one day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Burder produced ordered thousands of glasses from manufacturers in America which he then sold to schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But he added it was a shame not more pupils were involved in the eclipse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'Everyone remembers their first eclipse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In 1999, around 70 people reported a loss of vision after staring directly at the sun as it eclipsed the moon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Around 35 reported problems within two days, Public Health England said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>John O'Hagan, head of the optical radiation group at PHE, urged caution when preparing to watch it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'An eclipse is an amazing spectacle and one which we expect people all over the UK to enjoy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'But it's important to remember that this amazing sight, if viewed incorrectly, could pose a risk to your eyesight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'Even if it's cloudy there's a risk of eye damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sunglasses won't give enough protection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Furious parents spoke out earlier in the week after being told their children would not be allowed to watch the eclipse over health and safety fears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In Cheshire parents were asked to sign permission slips if they wanted their child to be involved while parents in Aberdeenshire resorted to keeping their children off school so that they could witness the eclipse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Some schools were selling glasses to pupils for 1 while others invited children to bring colanders to watch from the playground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Experts have issued stern advice about viewing the eclipse, warning people against looking directly at thew sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Below is expert advice about how best to safely enjoy from BBC's Stargazing Live Dr Lucie Green.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>People might think: 'I've got good-quality sunglasses here', but that's not good enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'Sunglasses will cut out UV light, which is the shorter-wavelength radiation, but actually they'll let through the infra-red light, which is a longer wavelength, and that's the stuff which causes the burn to your eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Luckily, there are ingenious, cheap and home-made ways you can view the event safely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Dr Lucie Green, of BBC's Stargazing Live, says: 'A very tiny hole in a piece of cardboard will project an image of the Sun onto another piece of card that is held about a metre away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>'Even a pin-hole in the side of a cereal packet will do the trick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Standing with your back to the Sun, when the eclipse is under way, hold the paper with the hole in it towards the Sun and project the light onto the second sheet by holding it behind the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>'You will find that an upside down image of the Sun will appear on the second piece of paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>However, she advises against filling a bucket with water to look at the Sun's reflection on the surface - another common eclipse-viewing tip - as it is too dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>That's unlikely as most of the pairs - which are fitted with a special form of filter that reduces the Sun's light by 100,000 times - have been sold out for days.</td></tr>
