<h3>American Federation of Teachers endorses Hillary Clinton</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton picked up the first major union endorsement of the 2016 campaign on Saturday, when the American Federation of Teachers threw their support behind the Democratic front-runner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"In vision, in experience and in leadership, Hillary Clinton is the champion working families need in the White House," AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Hillary Clinton is a tested leader who shares our values, is supported by our members, and is prepared for a tough fight on behalf of students, families and communities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The endorsement is a timely boost for Clinton, who has seen increased buzz building around left-wing challenger and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But while Sanders has deep ties with some unions, the AFT and its president have long been close to Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She won the endorsement from the 1.5 million member union in her last campaign, and the endorsement this time around has long been expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"For nearly a century, the American Federation of Teachers has worked to expand opportunity for the people and communities they serve," Clinton said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) all met with the AFT earlier this spring, and Weingarten indicated after those meetings that Clinton would likely be the group's favored candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The former Secretary of State has yet to take sides on some major disagreements within the education world that have split Democrats in recent year, specifically issues surrounding charter schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>School reform advocates are pressing for more charter schools, while many teachers' unions oppose those changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At the same time, some in education have argued for weaker union contracts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton has warned against the push to "scapegoat teachers" in some of her speeches, a point the AFT highlights in its endorsement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She's also been talking up ways to lower college student debt and increase pre-K education access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She will be in New York City on Monday to offer more details on her broader economic agenda, and may touch on education during the speech.</td></tr>
