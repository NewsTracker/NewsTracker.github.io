<h3>Facebook launches live video for celebs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook has launched a live video function for celebrities on its Mentions app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The feature will allow any star with a verified account to broadcast to fans who follow them..</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It'll be in competition with services like Periscope and Meerkat and will appear in people's News Feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Facebook Mentions app allows athletes, musicians, politicians and other stars to talk with their fans and each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You'll be able to comment on, like or share the video while watching a live broadcast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>How to use Facebook Mentions Live - for celebs!</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Comments will be added at a readable, steady pace and stars will have the option to turn comments off or use filters to blacklist any words they don't want to appear in their feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>You can also see when your friends or other public figures start watching through push alerts but you won't be able to share a live feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If you don't catch the broadcast, you can watch the video later on the public figure's page, although stars do have the option to delete the video if they want to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That's different from Periscope (which keeps the video for 24 hours) and Meerkat (which immediately deletes videos).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Serena Williams were among the first to broadcast live.</td></tr>
