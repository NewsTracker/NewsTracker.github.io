<h3>Ford shifts truck production from Mexico to Ohio</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The announcement came as presidential contender Donald Trump railed against exporting production to Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>DEARBORN, Mich., Aug. 12 (UPI) -- The Ford Motor Co. announced production of its heavy-duty trucks has moved from Mexico to Ohio, as labor negotiations enter their final month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A report last month that production of several of key Ford car lines would move from plants in Michigan to Mexican facilities got bargaining between Ford and the United Auto Workers (UAW) off to a sour start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Their labor contract expires in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ford said production of redesigned F-650 and F-750 trucks has begun at the Avon Lake, Ohio, plant, adding the production change would secure 1,000 UAW jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The plant, near Cleveland, is among the largest employers in Lorain County, Ohio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company added it will invest $168 million in upgrades to the facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ford has expanded its production presence in Mexico, a fact noted by Republican presidential contender Donald Trump Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Speaking in Birch Run, Mich., before about 2,000 people, Trump said he would, as president, persuade Ford to return jobs to the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Ford is building a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico," he said to a chorus of boos from the crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I'll actually give them a good idea. Why don't we just let the illegals drive the cars and trucks right into our country?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I would say, the deal is not going to be approved, I won't allow it. I want that plant in the United States, preferably here. So then I only have one question: Do they move the plant to the United States the same day, or a day later?"</td></tr>
