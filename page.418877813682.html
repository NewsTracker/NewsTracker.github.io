<h3>Athens exchange to reopen tomorrow or Thursday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Greek stock market will reopen tomorrow or Thursday after a month-long shutdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, there will be restrictions on trading by local investors at the request of the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Greek securities regulator chairman confirmed the situation to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Athens Stock Exchange has been shut since the end of June, after the government closed its banks and imposed capital controls to prevent them from collapsing in the face of mass withdrawals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece sent a first proposal to the ECB last week to reopen the stock market as soon as possible because it risked its place in global securities indexes if it remained closed for too long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, the process was delayed because the ECB wanted assurances that Greek investors would not pull money out of banks to convert them to shares or bonds, putting a further strain on the country's struggling lenders which depend on ECB's emergency funding to remain afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Today, Greece gained the European Central Bank's approval to reopen its stock market with no restrictions for foreign investors but with limitations for the local ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A ministerial decree on the bourse's operations is expected to be issued, opening the way for trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece's main equity index was down 16% from its 2015 peak, hit in February, when the exchange was shut down.</td></tr>
