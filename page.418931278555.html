<h3>Facebook ready to test giant drone for internet service</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook has said it will begin test flights later this year of a solar-powered drone with the wingspan of a Boeing 737, the next stage of its campaign to deliver internet service to remote parts of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Engineers at the giant social network say they have built a drone with a 140-foot wingspan that weighs less than 1,000 pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It will use lasers to send internet signals to stations on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The project is part of a broader effort by Facebook that also contemplates using satellites and other high-tech gear to deliver internet connectivity to hundreds of millions of people living in regions too remote for conventional service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Facebook rival Google is experimenting with high-altitude balloons and satellites in a programme that has similar goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Facebook laser communications system should be accurate enough to hit a target the size of a dime at a distance of 11 miles, said Yael Maguire, director of the unit, which is responsible for drones, satellites and other high-tech communications projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"There's a lot of moving parts here that have to work in concert," said Mr Maguire, during a press briefing at the company's headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Facebook also has a separate but related initiative that works with wireless carriers to provide limited mobile internet service at no cost, in countries where residents are too poor to afford traditional wireless plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the company invited reporters to hear an update on its effort to provide service to about 10% of the world's population who live in regions where it is not practical or too expensive to build the usual infrastructure for internet service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Facebook's drone was developed in part with engineering expertise that joined the company when it acquired a British aerospace startup, Ascenta, last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Facebook engineering vice president Jay Parikh said the team created a design that uses rigid but light-weight layers of carbon fibre, capable of flying in the frosty cold temperatures found at high altitudes, for an extended period of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The plan calls for using helium balloons to lift each drone into the air, Mr Parikh said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The drones are designed to climb to 90,000 feet, safely above commercial airliners and thunderstorms, where they will fly in circles through the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>At night, he said, they will settle to about 60,000 feet to conserve battery power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Each drone will fly in a circle with a radius of about three kilometres, which the engineers hope will enable it to provide internet service to an area with a radius of about 50 kilometres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>For the plan to work, Facebook's engineers are also counting on a recent breakthrough they've made in laser optics, which Mr Maguire said would allow them to transmit data at up to 10 gigabits per second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That is comparable to fibre networks on the ground but about 10 times faster than standard laser signals, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Facebook is designing the drones to transmit signals from one aircraft to another, so they can relay signals across a broader area on the ground, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>While Facebook has built and tested smaller prototypes at a plant in the United Kingdom, it is looking at a site in the United States for testing the full-sized drone, said Mr Parikh, who declined to be more specific.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Facebook hopes to share the technology with telecommunications carriers and development agencies, which it hopes will build and operate the drone networks, Mr Parikh said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We're not going to operate this ourselves," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We're focused on finding ways to drive the industry to move faster."</td></tr>
