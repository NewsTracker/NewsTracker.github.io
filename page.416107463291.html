<h3>Greece repays IMF loan instalment despite cash crunch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece repaid a roughly 450 million euro ($485-million) loan instalment to the International Monetary Fund due Thursday - easing concerns, for now, of a potential default as Athens faces a cash crunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The IMF debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended 240 billion euros in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Athens' growing financial problems had renewed fears the country might miss the IMF payment and even have to leave the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece's new left wing-led government has been locked in negotiations with creditors since winning elections in January on pledges to abolish the deeply resented budget austerity measures required by the rescue program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The creditors are insisting on the reforms, however, and want an agreement on them before they unfreeze Greece's rescue loans, which have been on hold since August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A last installment of the bailout worth 7.2 billion euros is pending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Finance Minsiter Yanis Varoufakis, speaking at a conference in Paris on Thursday, said Greece was committed to a fiscal plan that made sense, but that the government would not sign a deal just to get the bailout tranche.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The only way I know that you can impress upon the other side of the negotiating process that you mean business, that you want to change the conversation, is by saying: Folks, we are not going to sign on the dotted line of anything you give us just to get the next loan tranche," Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"At the very same time," he added, "we need to have a fiscal plan that makes sense. At the moment Greece is committed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Greece is unable to tap the international bond market for funds due to sky-high borrowing rates that reflect a lack of confidence in the country being able to repay its debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It has been surviving on its rescue loans since mid-2010, and the new government won a four-month extension to the main, European part of its bailout in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under the extension agreement, Athens must present a series of fiscal measures to reform its economy that meet the approval of its creditors at the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Authorities are hoping for a final agreement later this month, when finance ministers from eurozone countries meet on April 24 in Latvia.</td></tr>
