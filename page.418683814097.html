<h3>Hillary Clinton on racial justice: 'Black lives matter'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton said Monday that "black lives matter," in a nod to activists pressing Democrats to adopt tough rhetoric on racial justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The former secretary of state was responding to a reporter's question during a Facebook chat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He asked what she would have told progressive activists at Netroots Nation, a progressive conference that Clinton declined to attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Black lives matter. Everyone in this country should stand firmly behind that," Clinton wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We need to acknowledge some hard truths about race and justice in this country, and one of those hard truths is that racial inequality is not merely a symptom of economic inequality. Black people across America still experience racism every day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton called for body cameras on all police officers, prison reform, universal early childhood education and expansion of voting rights as steps for countering the effects of racism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton is among the Democrats who have taken flak in recent weeks for saying "all lives matter" - a response that some activists say is inadequate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Former Maryland governor and presidential candidate Martin O'Malley drew boos recently for telling demonstrators: "Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>O'Malley later apologized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clinton used the Facebook chat to rip Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) after he was quoted saying that "the gender card isn't alone enough" for her to become President.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Wow," Clinton wrote.</td></tr>
