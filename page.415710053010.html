<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Bardo museum in Tunis has reopened for officials, almost a week after 20 foreign tourists were killed in a militant attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But it will remain shut to the public until Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tourists were allowed to gather around the main gates, with police standing guard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We decided not to cancel our trip and today we've even decided to change our itinerary to come and take pictures - and to show our solidarity with Tunisians," said Rose Marie, a Canadian tourist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At least two gunmen opened fire on visitors as they got off buses at the museum last Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Security forces later killed two men, who are said to have been recruited at mosques in Tunisia and trained at a jihadist camp in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was Tunisia worst attack in more than a decade, testing the country's young democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile, those who work in Tunisia's tourism industry have joined a march, to also show their solidarity and to remember the victims of the rampage.</td></tr>
