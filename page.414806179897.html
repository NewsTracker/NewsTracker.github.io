<h3>Ex-prostitutes drop civil case against DSK</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The former prostitutes had delivered dramatic testimony during the trial of how they felt powerless to say no to Mr Strauss-Kahn performing certain sexual acts during sex parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But their lawyer said they felt unable to prove that the former political heavyweight knew the women were prostitutes and were dropping their civil case against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was running parallel to the criminal trial in which Mr Strauss-Kahn and 13 others are charged with pimping and could face up to 10 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The trial in the northern city of Lille has entered its third and final week, with lawyers and prosecutors set to sum up their cases after a fortnight of often lurid accounts about the orgies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One of the ex-prostitutes, Jade, said the forced sexual act carried out by Mr Strauss-Kahn was evidence he knew he was with a prostitute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Mr Strauss-Kahn argued he was not on trial for "deviant sexual practices" and was "horrified at the practice of using prostitutes."</td></tr>

<h3>Battle persists for Ukraine railway hub, despite peace deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Ukrainian government and Russia-backed rebels accused each other Monday of violating a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine, a day before the parties are due to start withdrawing heavy weaponry under a recently brokered deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The cease-fire, which went into effect on Sunday, had raised cautious hopes for an end to the 10-month-old conflict, which has already claimed more than 5,300 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>LUHANSKE, Ukraine (AP) - Intense artillery exchanges between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists persisted Monday around a strategic town in eastern Ukraine - fighting that threatens to dash a cease-fire deal brokered by European leaders last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Under the cease-fire agreement negotiated by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, the warring sides are to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That plan already looks at risk, with the rebels saying they are not satisfied that conditions are in place for the process to go ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Associated Press reporters in Luhanske, a government-held town 15 kilometers (9 miles) northwest of the bitterly contested railway hub of Debaltseve, heard sustained shelling Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some of the artillery appeared to be outgoing, suggesting it was being fired by Ukrainian troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Debaltseve, still in government hands, remains in contention despite the cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The rebels insist the town should revert to their control because they have encircled it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A loaded Grad rocket launcher was seen pointing in the direction of Debaltseve, but it was not fired while AP journalists were present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Speaking by telephone Monday night, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko expressed concerns about the continued fighting at Debaltseve and "also expressed the wish that the OSCE observers have a free access to continue their work on the ground," an official in Hollande's entourage said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The official spoke anonymously because they were not allowed to speak publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Observers from the Organization from Security and Cooperation in Europe, who are supposed to monitor the cease-fire, said Sunday that separatists denied them access to Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement Monday afternoon that the U.S. was concerned about continued fighting in Debaltseve and statements by the separatists that they refuse to observe the cease-fire there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Despite the cease-fire that went into effect early Sunday morning, five Ukrainian troops were killed and 25 were wounded in the past 24 hours, Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Separatist military official Eduard Basurin said in a televised news conference Monday that the government overnight lobbed artillery at Horlivka, a town under rebel control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ukraine, however, blamed that attack on the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The government-appointed police chief of the Donetsk region, Vyacheslav Abroskin, said the separatists shelled the town in order to derail the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The cease-fire appeared to hold elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The city hall of the rebel capital Donetsk, which came under heavy artillery fire in the past week, said on Monday that there was no fighting in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of arming and supplying manpower to the separatists and have imposed a range of economic sanctions to pressure Moscow into changing its course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Russia denies all suggestions it is directly involved in the war in Ukraine, but the sheer amount of heavy weapons the rebels have belies that claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The cease-fire had raised cautious hopes for an end to the 10-month-old conflict, which has already claimed more than 5,300 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But Ukraine and rebel officials have already traded multiple accusations of attacks since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Both the separatists and the Ukrainian government insist they are committed to the cease-fire negotiated in marathon talks last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But the Russian news agency Interfax quoted Basurin as saying Monday that conditions are not yet ready to pull back heavy weapons on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We will begin pulling back equipment from the line of contact if we receive a certain signal, which is if the Ukrainians also do the same thing," Basurin was quoted as saying.</td></tr>
