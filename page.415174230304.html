<tr><td>3</td><td>Inside the funeral hall, mourners surround the coffin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mourners wait to get into the viewing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The line to view Nemtsov's body stretched for hundreds of yards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When the viewing concluded at the end of its scheduled four hours, many had yet to see the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police officers control the crowd of mourners during the farewell ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mourners throw flowers before the car transporting Nemtsov's coffin.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>One by one, thousands of mourners and dignitaries filed past the white-lined coffin of slain Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov on Tuesday, many offering flowers as they paid their last respects to one of the most prominent figures of Russia's beleaguered opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>So many arrived that when the viewing ended after its scheduled four hours, people in a line hundreds of yards long still waited outside the Sakharov Center, named after the Soviet-era dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nemtsov was shot to death late Friday while walking on a bridge near the Kremlin with his girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>No suspects have been arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The killing has deeply shaken Russia's small and marginalized opposition movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Many opposition supporters suspect the killing was ordered by the Kremlin in retaliation for Nemtsov's ardent criticism of President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Authorities have suggested several possible alternatives, including that Nemtsov was killed in an attempt to tarnish Putin's image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The shots were fired not only at Nemtsov but at all of us, at democracy in Russia," Gennady Gudkov, a prominent Kremlin opponent, said in a speech delivered next to the coffin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We never thought this could happen, but it did. Rest in peace, my friend. Your work will be continued."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, is the most prominent opposition figure to have been murdered in Russia during Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The only current Kremlin figure of any standing to attend was Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, who joined mourners filing into the hall where Nemtsov's open casket was on display.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Dvorkovich, from the Kremlin's increasingly sidelined liberal camp, carried red flowers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Several European dignitaries said they were unable to attend the ceremony because Russian officials would not let them into the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>For the most part, mourners were die-hard Kremlin opponents who feel deep alarm over Nemtsov's killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But they represent only a minority of the Russian population; polls show most Russians support Putin, despite a plummeting ruble and international sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Russian investigators say they are working to track down Nemtsov's killers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Investigative Committee handling the case said it has obtained closed-circuit television footage from the scene and has scheduled ballistic and medical tests.</td></tr>
