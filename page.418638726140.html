<h3>Crash victims' families reject Germanwings compensation offer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr (second right) and board members observe a minute of silence for the victims of the Germanwings flight 4U9525 before the annual shareholders' meeting in Hamburg in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Frankfurt: Some of the close relatives of those killed in the Germanwings plane crash in March have rejected the carrier's offer of 25,000 ($27,000) in compensation payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Elmar Giemulla, a lawyer representing some of the German victims, said he had notified Germanwings in a letter that the offer was inadequate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He added a low six-digit amount would be adequate compensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Germanwings, a unit of Lufthansa, was not immediately available to comment outside usual business hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>French emergency services at the crash site of the Germanwings jet in Seyne-les-Alpes in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Evidence shows co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit of Germanwings flight 4U9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf and deliberately steered the plane into a remote mountainside, killing all 150 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 25,000 offer is on top of 50,000 already paid as immediate financial assistance to relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>German law does not usually provide for a separate award for pain and suffering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The proposed payout for emotional distress would be made to parents, widowed spouses, partners and children of the victims and does not require proof of damages incurred to be presented in order for it to be made, Germanwings said in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Students from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school watch as hearses carrying the remains of 16 of their fellow students and two teachers who were killed in the Germanwings crash drive past on June 10 this year in Haltern am See, Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Relatives living in Germany may also claim an additional 10,000 each as compensation for any health problems without needing to offer formal proof, the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Families of the victims still have the right to make further claims for other financial costs, such as burial costs or lost pensions, although this will require proof of damages incurred.</td></tr>
