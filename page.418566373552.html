<h3>Greece seeks relief from lenders after first bailout test</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos leaves after a parliament meeting in Athens, Thursday, July 16, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece's Parliament has approved an austerity bill demanded by bailout creditors, despite a significant level of dissent from the governing leftist Syriza party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bill to impose sweeping tax hikes and spending cuts was approved with the support of three pro-European opposition parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece's troubled left-wing government was seeking urgent relief from European lenders Thursday, after it pushed a harsh austerity package through parliament, triggering a revolt in the governing party and violent demonstrations in central Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Finance ministers from countries using the euro currency were planning a conference call to consider rescue financing for Greece, while the European Central Bank will mull a request from Athens to increase emergency assistance to troubled Greek banks that have been closed since June 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The bill was the first step in meeting requirements for negotiations to start on a desperately needed third international bailout for Greece that will prevent it from crashing out of Europe's common currency, following a deal reached by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other Eurozone leaders after a marathon summit in Brussels last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a post-midnight vote, the country's parliament voted 229-64 to implement more austerity measures that include pension reforms and sweeping sales tax hikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Approval came thanks to pro-European opposition parties who voted in favor, and in spite of deepening dissent within Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Thirty-eight party lawmakers defied Tsipras - nearly one-in-four - by voting against or abstaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They included Tsipras' powerful energy minister, the speaker of parliament, and Yanis Varoufakis, the former finance minister who headed Greece's bailout strategy until his replacement 10 days ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The government described the vote as marking a "serious division" among its lawmakers, and indicated that dissenters in Tsipras' Cabinet would be swiftly replaced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Today, Parliament took the first important step for the deal, voting for the difficult measures," government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"But the results of today's vote constitute a serious division in the unity of Syriza parliamentary group," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The prime minister's and the government's priority is the successful conclusion of the agreement in the immediate future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Greeks have seen a dramatic decline in living standards since the debt-plagued country lost market access in 2010 and had to impose severe spending cuts in exchange for bailout loans from eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Before the austerity vote, some 12,000 demonstrators had gathered outside parliament in the biggest protest against the government since Tsipras won elections in late January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The rally turned violent when several hundred youths attacked police, torched cars, and smashed office displays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police said 37 people were detained and 16 arrested over the hour-long clashes that involved youths hurling rocks and petrol bombs outside parliament, and riot police responding with tear gas and baton charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tsipras said he had little choice other than to accept the harsh terms offered by lenders for the new three-year bailout worth 85 billion euros ($93 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We had a very specific choice: A deal we largely disagreed with, or a chaotic default," he told parliament ahead of the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Syriza won the January elections on a promise to end bailout austerity, and the government's acceptance of more cuts drew an angry reaction from many of its lawmakers - though none of the attacks were aimed at Tsipras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Parliament speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou slammed the deal as a product of blackmail, describing the additional poverty it would cause as an act of "social genocide."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The vote came after more than two weeks of capital controls, with banks and the stock exchange shut since June 29 and ATM cash withdrawals limited to 60 euros per day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Dangerously low on liquidity at banks and with the state practically out of cash, Greece desperately needs funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It faces a Monday deadline to repay 4.2 billion euros ($4.6 billion) to the ECB, and is also in arrears on 2 billion euros to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Negotiations on the new bailout will take an estimated four weeks, leaving European finance ministers scrambling to find ways to get Athens some money sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The European Commission has proposed giving Greece 7 billion euros in loans from a special fund overseen by all 28 EU nations so it can meet its upcoming debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This story corrects the date in the first reference to the bank closures to June 29, instead of July 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras reads his notes during a parliament meeting in Athens, Thursday, July 16, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Tsipras was fighting to keep his government intact in the face of outrage over an austerity bill that parliament must pass if the country is to start negotiations on a new bailout and avoid financial collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras reacts during a parliament meeting in Athens, Thursday, July 16, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Riot police try to avoid petrol bombs thrown by anti-austerity protesters in Athens, Wednesday, July 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Greece has a tentative rescue deal, but relief that it is not falling out of the euro is unlikely to last long: its economy has taken a huge hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Months of political brinkmanship, uncertainty and bank closures have hurt companies and brought everyday business to a standstill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Riot police try to avoid petrol bombs and a fire cracker thrown by anti-austerity protesters in Athens, Wednesday, July 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos holds a coffee as he arrives for the lawmakers meeting of Syriza governing party at the Greek Parliament in Athens, Wednesday, July 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Greece's Prime Ministers Alexis Tsipras faced a rising wave of hostility from members of his own party Wednesday ahead of a parliament vote on an austerity bill that condemns the country to years of spending cuts but is required to get a new bailout package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Parliament speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou, left, speaks with Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis during lawmakers meeting of Syriza governing party at the Greek Parliament in Athens, Wednesday, July 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has faced strident dissent even from top ministers, with Lafazanis saying in a post on his ministry's website that the deal the prime minister reached was "unacceptable" and calling on him to withdraw it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Parliament Member Yanis Varoufakis arrives for a meeting with lawmakers of Syriza governing party at the Greek Parliament in Athens, Wednesday, July 15, 2015.</td></tr>
