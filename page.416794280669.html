<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu cobbles together Israel government with narrowest of margins</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) smiles with HaBayit HaYehudi leader Naftali Bennett at the Knesset in Jerusalem after announcing the 11th-hour formation of a coalition government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jerusalem: Scrambling to meet a midnight deadline, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formed a narrow governing coalition with only a razor-thin majority in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's control of just 61 seats in the 120-member Knesset is a far cry from the 67-seat majority he was expected to command after his Likud Party won an overwhelming election victory in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The one-vote margin left his new government, cobbled together on Wednesday, vulnerable to collapse if just one of the partners withdraws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses parliament this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"A coalition of 61 will be very fragile, and Netanyahu will find it very difficult to make major reforms. That's the ironic outcome of the election," said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Netanyahu said he hoped to win additional partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Sixty-one is a good number - 61 plus is even better - but it starts with 61, and we will get started," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Netanyahu said he would notify Israeli President Reuven Rivlin that he had succeeded in forming a coalition by Wednesday's deadline and would present his new Cabinet next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men dance around a bonfire in the Mea Shearim neighbourhood of Jerusalem on Wednesday to mark the religious holiday of Lag BaOmer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ultra-Orthodox parties will return to Israel's government as part of the coalition deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>When he called snap elections following dissension in his outgoing Cabinet last year, Mr Netanyahu had been confident that he would emerge with a more manageable coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But weeks of post-election political horse-trading and an eleventh-hour desertion by a former ally, outgoing Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, had left Mr Netanyahu struggling to close a deal with the ultra-nationalist HaBayit HaYehudi (Jewish Home) party to cement the coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Now we're ending up with a situation that is even less stable than before," Mr Plesner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"A narrow government is big trouble for the Knesset," said Yuli Edelstein, the speaker of the Knesset and a member of Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Netanyahu centre, flanked by Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon (left) and Energy Minister Silvan Shalom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Along with the Likud and HaBayit HaYehudi, the coalition comprises two ultra-Orthodox religious parties and a centre-right party, Kulanu, whose leader, Moshe Kahlon, campaigned on a platform of economic reforms and will serve as finance minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Jewish Home, which supports Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank and calls for annexing part of the territory to Israel, is expected to have two ministers in the next Cabinet, although it won only eight parliamentary seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In a last-minute concession to Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett, Mr Netanyahu agreed to appoint Ayelet Shaked as justice minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ms Shaked has sought to limit the powers of the Israeli Supreme Court and to change the composition of its judges, arguing that it wields too much authority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Outgoing Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's predicament was in large measure the result of an unexpected defection by Mr Lieberman, the outspoken foreign minister, whose relationship with the prime minister has soured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>On Monday, Mr Lieberman announced that he was stepping down from his post and would not join the coalition, depriving Mr Netanyahu of the six seats won by Mr Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu (Israel is Our Home) party, which would have given the prime minister a comfortable 67-seat majority.</td></tr>
