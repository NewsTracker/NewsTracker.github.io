<h3>Rose scores 34, Bulls hold off Bucks 113-106 in double OT (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Derrick Rose scored 34 points, Jimmy Butler added 24 and the Chicago Bulls beat the Milwaukee Bucks 113-106 in double overtime on Thursday night to take a 3-0 lead in their Eastern Conference playoff series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Butler got the second overtime off to a rousing start, intercepting a backcourt pass from Giannis Antetokounmpo and racing in for a layup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It set the tone for an 8-0 run that gave Chicago a 109-101 lead with 2:44 left to finally shake the pesky Bucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rose atoned for a missed free throw with 4 seconds left in regulation that left the game tied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He scored six points in the second overtime, including a layup off an offensive rebound with 2:15 left for a 10-point lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Antetokounmpo had 25 points and Khris Middleton added 18 for Milwaukee, which went scoreless for more than 6 minutes between the first and second overtimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Bulls will go for the sweep on Saturday in Game 4 in Milwaukee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>No NBA team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Chicago appeared to have wrapped up the game with 2:50 left in regulation after Tony Snell hit his second straight 3 for a 94-84 lead, rousing an often Bulls-friendly crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Bradley Center at times felt like a northern outpost for Bulls fans who made the barely 90-minute drive from Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the young Bucks didn't quit and their fans backed them up, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Middleton had eight points over the final 1:27 of regulation, including a floater with 10 seconds left that gave the Bucks a 95-94 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rose went 1 of 2 from the free throw line, and Middleton missed a 27-footer at the other end to send the game into overtime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It was a fitting stretch run to a wildly entertaining game featuring one of the East's standard-bearers against the scrappy upstarts from Milwaukee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rose carried the Bulls for much of the second half, getting a big assist off the bench from Snell as Chicago built a late 10-point lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Bucks blew an 18-point lead in the second quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It was hard to believe that Chicago trailed 49-31 with 4:03 left in the second quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But the Bulls closed the half with an 18-4 spurt to get within 53-49.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Former Bulls forward Scottie Pippen rooted them on courtside.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>... G Kirk Hinrich, who was questionable with a left knee injury, played 6 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>... Rose was 5 of 7, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range, for 13 points in the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Bucks: The bench gave the Bucks a huge lift in a 22-4 run in the second quarter that helped them open the short-lived 18-point lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Jared Dudley led the reserves with 10 points in the half on 4-of-4 shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>... Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and receiver Randall Cobb were at the game, sitting on the baseline across from the Bucks bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>... Former team owner and U.S. Senator Herb Kohl attended the game in his usual seat, about four rows up on center court.</td></tr>
