<h3>Syria opposition turns to internal opponents</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Khaled Khoja, who became president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces in January, told Reuters in an interview that the group's goal was still for President Bashar al-Assad to leave power, but that it was no longer a precondition to begin talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Despite having only tenuous links with fighters on the ground and seen as out of touch with the general population, the National Coalition remains one of the main parties in international discussions to end the almost four-year-old civil war that has killed more than 200,000 and displaced millions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have a new strategy which is based on taking the initiative and launching a dialogue between the coalition and other parties that aren't part of it," Khoja said late on Wednesday after holding talks with U.N. Syria Envoy Steffan De Mistura.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The ultimate objective is to have a general assembly that includes all parties who want a new Syria and have a common stance towards any negotiation process with the regime based on the Geneva 1 agreements."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There currently is no serious peace process in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the four years of fighting, two U.N. mediators have hosted high-profile conferences in Geneva, only to quit in frustration after they failed to yield meaningful progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Agreements reached in 2012 in Geneva, when a document approved by rival sides called for creating a transitional governing body with full executive powers, would be the basis for any talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Khoja, 49, said the key was to end the bloodshed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said he had had some success after secret talks arranged by France 10 days ago with the domestic National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The two sides agreed for the first time on a joint roadmap calling for a transitional governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Khoja is also to hold talks with other internal groups, including Building the Syrian State, led by activist Louay Hussein, and others who could be deemed close to the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We will continue until we have as many opposition parties and figures as possible," the Damascus-born doctor and businessman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"As the umbrella of the Syrian opposition, we insist on the goal of toppling Assad and the security services that serve him, but it is not necessary to have this condition at the beginning of the process," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Khoja added, however, that it was vital any transition ensured the state apparatus remained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In previous peace talks, Assad's camp has belittled the Western-backed opposition for its lack of legitimacy and representation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>His two main backers, Russia and Iran, have also pointed to the lack of a credible opposition and said Assad's departure could leave an even larger vacuum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>However, with the rise of Islamic State, there is a sense that the deteriorating security situation and fact that neither side can prevail militarily may create an opportunity to revive peace talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We are at a time when talking again about finding a political solution is credible," a French diplomatic source said ahead of a meeting between Khoja and President Francois Hollande on Thursday.</td></tr>

<h3>Jurors hear graphic accounts of Boston Marathon bombing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This undated photo provided by Bill Richard shows his son, Martin Richard, in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Martin Richard was one of three people killed in the bombing near the finish line of the race on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The boy's younger sister, 6-year-old Jane, had a leg blown off, while their older brother, Henry, suffered minor injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Their father, testifying at Tsarnaev's federal death penalty trial, spoke in a slow, halting voice but remained largely composed as he described the chaos and confusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said he scooped Jane up in one arm and took Henry in the other and "tried to shield both of their eyes" from the carnage around them as he took them away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Richard took the stand as federal prosecutors continued trying to drive home the consequences of the attack in such heartbreaking detail that Tsarnaev's lawyers objected - and were overruled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some of the women on the jury appeared to wince at times during his testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Spectators in the courtroom could be heard crying quietly, including Rebekah Gregory, who lost a leg in the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As Richard testified, the jury watched a video of the father rushing to help his children and a grievously wounded Jane struggling to get up, only to fall down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A prosecutor showed Richard a photo and circled a face - a young man in a white baseball cap worn backward- who could be seen just a few feet behind Jane and Martin as the youngsters stood on a metal barricade, watching the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was Tsarnaev, shortly before the two pressure-cooker bombs went off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Richard said he himself suffered shrapnel injuries, burns on his legs and two perforated eardrums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His wife, Denise, was blinded in one eye and had other injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier Thursday, Roseann Sdoia testified that she saw two flashes of white light at her feet near the finish line, looked down, and for a split second thought to herself: I'm wearing strappy sandals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She quickly realized she was looking at her foot dangling from her mangled leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Someone came running over to me and told me I had to get out of there. I told them I couldn't get up. I didn't have a leg," a sobbing Sdoia told the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She walked to the witness stand on an artificial leg, plainly visible below the hemline of her skirt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Sdoia, who was at the race as a spectator, said she saw wounded people all around her, including someone covered with soot, dazed and "walking around like a zombie."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Prosecutors also showed the jury a grisly photo of her shredded leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyer has admitted the former college student took part in the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But in a bid to save Tsarnaev from a death sentence, she argued that he was influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a getaway attempt days after the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Also Thursday, Jeff Bauman - who lost both legs in the attack and was photographed being wheeled away that day in one of the most widely seen images of the tragedy - testified that he locked eyes with one of the bombers shortly before the twin blasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"He was alone. He wasn't watching the race," said Bauman, who walked slowly into court on two prosthetic legs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I looked at him, and he just kind of looked down at me. I just thought it was odd."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Later, from his hospital bed, Bauman remembered the man's face clearly enough to give the FBI a description of someone authorities say turned out to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Before testimony began Thursday, Tsarnaev's lawyers complained to the judge that the survivors' testimony from the previous day went into too much detail about the effect on their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They said that kind of testimony should be reserved for the punishment phase of the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. said the testimony did not go too far.</td></tr>
