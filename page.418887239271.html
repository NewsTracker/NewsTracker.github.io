<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Defence attorney Tamara Brady, standing, questions Robert Holmes, top right, the father of James Holmes, on screen, during the sentencing phase of James' trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Centennial, Colorado: He sounded like a proud father leafing through the family album: There's Jimmy with his grandma, kicking a soccer ball, in a taekwondo uniform, holding his new baby sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There's the annual family portrait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mouse ears at Disneyland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Boating at Big Bear Lake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This week, however, Robert Holmes was narrating a parent's worst nightmare: The story of his son's youth, told at the young man's murder trial in front of the jury that would decide whether his first-born would live or die.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A memorial along Alameda Avenue, Aurora, to honour the 12 victims of the massacre at a nearby movie theatre three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Jimmy" is James E. Holmes, now 27, who was convicted less than two weeks ago of 165 counts of murder and attempted murder in the 2012 cinema massacre in Aurora, Colorado.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He killed eight men, three women and a little girl and wounded 70 others, many seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The verdict means the former neuroscience graduate student could get the death penalty for shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His parents have sat just a few feet behind him throughout the lengthy trial in Centennial, Colorado.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They've watched survivors of the grisly shooting describe their horror, heard the families of victims cry, looked at photographs of the bodies their son left strewn across the floor of Theatre 9 of the Century 16 cineplex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>James Holmes in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Defence attorney Tamara Brady: "Is James Holmes your son?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Robert Holmes: "Yes he is."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Brady: "Have you been here throughout this trial?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>James Holmes in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Holmes: "Yes, I have."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Brady: "Has it been hard for you to listen to?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Holmes: "Yes. It's been a very difficult experience... "</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Brady: "Do you still love him?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Holmes: "Yes, I do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Brady: "Why?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Holmes: "He's my son. We got along pretty well. He's an excellent kid."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The death penalty trial of the Aurora gunman is nearing the end of the so-called mitigation phase - the time when defense attorneys are trying to convince jurors that one of the deadliest mass shooters in American history is a human being.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The defense wants mercy for Holmes, a sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole rather than execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>For the last week, a parade of school friends, college friends, church friends and elementary school teachers has testified that Holmes was quiet, socially awkward, maybe withdrawn, but also very smart and completely nonviolent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>They talked about his love of video games and his volunteer work at a Mexican orphanage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They called him "Jimmy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It is a childhood nickname only witnesses may use in court, as per the order of Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. Defense attorneys call him Mr. Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Prosecutors began trial referring to him with a disdainful "that guy," but have since settled on "the defendant."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>On Tuesday morning, former neighbor Lori Bidwell talked about how "Jimmy was very shy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>His second-grade teacher, Ann Hestand, said, "I cared for him in 1996, and I still care for Jimmy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Fifth-grade teacher Paul Henry Karrer said the defendant - "he's Jimmy to me" - was "like a renaissance child."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>That child grew into a deeply uncommunicative young man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Once he went off to college, James Holmes was someone who largely interacted with his parents via email and text, his father testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Holmes gave his parents no inkling until it was too late that he had found and lost a girlfriend, dropped out of graduate school, amassed an arsenal, the father said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>His psychiatrist at the University of Colorado called Robert and Arlene Holmes in mid-June 2012, concerned about their son's behaviour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>On July 4, they decided to make the trip from their home in San Diego to check on his welfare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>They never got there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>On July 20, James Holmes wrapped himself in protective armor, grabbed his weapons and shot up the Aurora multiplex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Brady: "Assuming Mr. Holmes stays in jail or prison, do you and your wife intend to try and visit him if he will let you see him?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Robert Holmes: "Yes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Brady: "Will you write him letters?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Holmes: "Yes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Brady: "Will you always do that?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The trial is in the punishment phase, when it will be determined if Holmes should be put to death or serve a mandatory life sentence with no possibility of parole.</td></tr>
