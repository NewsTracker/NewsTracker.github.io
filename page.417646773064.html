<h3>The unbelievable damage Islamic State has done to ancient sites in Iraq and Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A social media website video purports to show IS militants destroying the ancient city of Nimrud in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As the Islamic State continues its efforts to create a "caliphate," killing thousands in its path, the group is also pursuing another campaign: the destruction of historic sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The militant group has destroyed numerous sites that have high historic and cultural value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The militants espouse a radical, puritanical strain of Sunni Islam whereby all shrines or holy sites that honour beings lesser than their God are considered apostate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jihadists use sledgehammers on a toppled statue in a museum at a location thought to be Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But as The Washington Post's Loveday Morris reports, the extremists aren't only attacking the sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They also "have been quietly selling off smaller antiquities from Iraq and Syria, earning millions of dollars in an increasingly organised pillaging of national treasures."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The jihadists' hatred and destruction of ancient artifacts, shrines, statues, even mosques, often recorded and then distributed on social media, have caused global outrage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Here is a look at some of the sites that were destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>An Islamic State militant destroys the statue of Lamassu, an Assyrian deity, with a jackhammer in the northern Iraqi Governorate of Nineveh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Weeks after the militants seized Mosul, the largest city in northern Iraq and one with a rich cultural heritage - it's a holy site for both Christians and Muslims - was ruined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The destruction of the tomb of the prophet Jonah was one of the first major atrocities against a historic site carried out by the Islamic State, and it "brought a new level of resentment," wrote Morris, one that the lack of electricity and water had not yet caused in the month after the Islamic State seized control of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The rubble of the destroyed Tomb of Younis, or Jonah, in Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In what the United Nations' cultural agency deemed a "war crime," the Islamic State used heavy military vehicles to bulldoze the 3000-year-old Nimrud archeological site, crushing relics from one of ancient Mesopotamia's greatest cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The famous landmark, discovered in the last century, was known for its "pre-Islamic cultural heritage."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The second capital of the ancient kingdom of Assyria, Nimrud was built about 1250 B.C. and destroyed in 612 B.C. At its height, it was the centre of one of the most powerful states at the time, reaching through modern-day Egypt, Turkey and Iran."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Islamic State extremists at Iraq's ancient city of Hatra destroyed the archaeological site by smashing sledgehammers into its walls and shooting Kalashnikov assault rifles at priceless statues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Militants used weapons to attack Hatra, an ancient fortress city in northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Video released by the Islamic State shows the militants pulverising carvings, statues and walls, using guns, sledgehammers and pickaxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the footage, one fighter says: "Praise to God, who enabled us and the soldiers of Islamic State to remove the signs of polytheism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>An IS jihadist pushes a statue over inside the Mosul museum in the northern Iraqi Governorate of Nineveh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Until its ravaging at the hands of the extremists," Tharoor wrote, "Hatra was a remarkably well-preserved ancient site. It first rose to prominence in the 3rd century, probably as a garrison town for the Seleucid Empire, one of the quasi-Greek kingdoms that emerged after the death of Alexander the Great and the splintering of his short-lived empire in Asia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In February, the Islamic State went to the Nineveh Museum in Mosul and used sledgehammers to smash artifacts that were known as some of the most cherished of pre-Islamic antiquity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>An Islamic State jihadist takes a sledgehammer to carvings in the ancient Iraqi Assyrian city of Nimrud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The jihadists' reasoning?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"These statues, these idols, and these antiquities, when Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, ordered to destroy and remove them, it was an easy matter. We do not care even if it costs billions of dollars."</td></tr>
