<h3>With La Stella on DL, could Bryant make Cubs' debut Friday? (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) -- Could Kris Byrant make his Chicago Cubs' debut as early as Friday?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Cubs placed infielder Tommy La Stella on the disabled list Tuesday because of right ribcage inflammation and recalled left-hander Zac Rosscup from Triple-A Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chicago manager Joe Maddon said ''it's possible'' the Cubs could add an infielder for Friday's game against San Diego.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Cubs President of Baseball Operations Theo Epstein didn't discount the possibility another infielder could join the team by the time the homestand ends Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It depends on what's happening with the roster, what's happening with his development,'' Epstein said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Friday is day 13 of the season, which means Bryant could at most accumulate 171 days or of major league service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Since 172 days counts as a year, keeping Bryant in the minor leagues through Thursday ensures Bryant could not be eligible for free agency until after the 2021 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bryant hit .425 for the Cubs in spring training with nine homers and 15 RBIs in 40 at-bats and entered Tuesday batting .381 at Iowa with two homers and seven RBIs in five game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Adding Rosscup gives the Cubs 13 pitchers but leaves them short in the infield with Mike Olt battling a right wrist injury after getting hit by a pitch last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Maddon wouldn't say whether the Cubs considered bringing up an infielder Tuesday, saying ''today was about a pitcher.'' The Chicago bullpen has been taxed to start the season, throwing 21 2-3 innings in six games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 26-year-old La Stella is batting .167 in six games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Rosscup was 1-0 with a 9.45 ERA in 18 appearances with the Cubs last season.</td></tr>
