<h3>Greece, eurozone finance chief deny 3rd bailout in works</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This calm scene in the Plaka neighborhood of Athens contrasts with the tumult roiling the halls of power in Europe over Greece's financial conditions and their potential impact on the eurozone ecomomy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MADRID - Spain created hours of confusion over the future of Greece's troubled finances Monday by announcing that eurozone nations were negotiating a third Greek bailout of up to $56 billion, then backtracking hours later by saying the prospect of such a bailout is only hypothetical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The high-profile sequence of events began when Spain's Economy Ministry said Minister Luis de Guindos declared at a conference in the northeastern city of Pamplona that a new bailout for Greece could provide between $34 billion and $56 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Its "central scenario for Greece is a deal on the basis of the current bailout, and new conditions to be set with flexibility," de Guindos said in comments circulated by the ministry to media outlets clearly stating that a round of negotiations were under way for a third Greek bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We're negotiating a third bailout for Greece that will be between 30 and 50 billion euros. ... Greece will not leave the eurozone," the minister said, according to comments distributed to media outlets by his ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"That would not be good for Greece and for the eurozone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the eurozone's top financial official quickly denied the claim that fresh bailout talks were under way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The bailout that de Guindos outlined "is not something that is being discussed," said Simone Boitelle, the spokeswoman for Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is both finance minister for the Netherlands and chairman of the Eurogroup body of eurozone members of which de Guindos is a member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Greek finance ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of ministry policy preventing the official from being named, also denied any talks were being held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has previously ruled out a third bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Five hours after de Guindos' comments were disclosed, his ministry put out another statement saying de Guindos only outlined "a hypothetical third program for Greece" that would have to be negotiated by the Eurogroup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece received a four-month extension on its rescue loans agreement last month but will need to make reforms in order to get more money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It faces a cash crunch as early as this month.</td></tr>
