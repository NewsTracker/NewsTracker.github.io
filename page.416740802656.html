<h3>John Kerry takes selfie with baby elephant in Kenya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It may be the official mascot of the Republican party, but even Secretary of State John Kerry couldn't resist taking a selfie with an elephant during his trip to Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The former Democrat presidential candidate smiled big with his 'new friend', as he dubbed the baby he met while visiting the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage in Nairobi National Park on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the elephant who was ready for it's close-up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Kerry, who snapped the picture while feeding several of the orphans, accidentally cut out most of the elephant's face in the frame's tight squeeze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Secretary of State was touring the park on Sunday to learn more about the country's wildlife conservation efforts, according to the Washington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Monday Kerry's trip took a somber turn as he commemorated the victims of Kenya's past and present terror attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He laid a wreath for the victims of the deadly 1998 bombings of the US Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, twin attacks by a rising Al-Qaeda that killed 224 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While speaking at the former Nairobi Embassy's site, now known as the August 7th Memorial Park, Kerry praised the embassy's current staff - which includes several employees that survived the attack 17 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kerry also offered his condolences to families of friends of the 148 people, mainly students, who were massacred at Garissa University College by the al-Shabab network last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Al-Shabab was also responsible for the 2013 attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi that killed 67 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'Terrorists will always fail,' Kerry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Secretary of State offered American support in the country's fight against al-Shabab and announced that the U.S. would be giving Kenya $45million to aid the country's refugee crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kerry said that Americans and Kenyans have the ability to fight back, both with military might and the power of their 'unity and the character of our ideals'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Monday he also met with Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta to preview President Obama's scheduled trip to the country in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>U.S. relations with Kenyatta have improved since the International Criminal Court dropped charges of crimes against humanity against him in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Those were linked to violence that killed hundreds of people after Kenya's contested 2007 presidential election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tensions remain, however, as the U.S. believes Kenyatta should do more to improve human rights, from addressing the post-election killings last decade to stamping out continued incidents of police violence and pressure against journalists, activists and political opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And on counterterrorism, where cooperation is close, both sides aren't completely content with the partnership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Americans think the Kenyans can be more effective in providing security at a time when al-Shabaab has encountered severe setbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And it is pressuring Kenyatta's government not to follow through with threats to close the sprawling Dadaab camp for Somali refugees, which is the world's largest at more than 300,000 inhabitants.</td></tr>
