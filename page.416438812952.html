<h3>Hello? Facebook launches voice-calling app for Android phones</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK - Hello?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Anyone there?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook unveiled a new voice-calling app for Android phones on Wednesday, the same day that its WhatsApp messaging service introduced voice-calling for iOS devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Called "Hello," the stand-alone app is the seventh child of Facebook Creative Labs, the company's arm tasked with creating new applications outside of Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Others, such as the news-reading app Paper or the video sharing app Riff, have met with limited success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hello's aim is to give people more information about who is calling them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Because it's connected to Facebook, Hello users can see information about their callers' identity even if they don't count them as a contact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hello is currently available in the U.S., Brazil and Nigeria.</td></tr>
