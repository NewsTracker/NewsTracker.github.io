<h3>Hillary Clinton?s use of personal email was risky: expert</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The personal email systems that most of us use, such as Yahoo, Gmail or AOL, are extremely convenient but extremely unsafe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>I have three email accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One is my personal email account, the second is my university email account and the third is an account with encryption capability that I use only for federal government consulting work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This third system stores all the attachments in my local machine and not on its server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>I am extremely cautious in using this l system and use all the protection mechanisms I can and do not access the web from the machines I use for the government consulting work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As a result, this email system has not been hacked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the personal email system that I use to communicate with friends and relatives has been hacked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Why are corporate or government email systems usually more secure?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They usually have dedicated personnel focusing on security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They mandate that we change our passwords, encrypt sensitive emails and carry out penetration testing and monitor the systems for possible attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>These systems also use the latest patches as much as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Attackers are aware that personal email systems store personal data on their servers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They know that the attachments on these systems are often not encrypted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Therefore they are in a better position to exploit these vulnerabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Anyone who sends sensitive messages must use an email system that is secure and provided by a company or the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That goes for Hillary Clinton and for you and me.</td></tr>
