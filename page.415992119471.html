<h3>Dallas hospital seeks dismissal of nurse's suit over Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Texas Health Resources filed a response Friday to the March 2 lawsuit by nurse Nina Pham, The Dallas Morning News reported Saturday (http://bit.ly/1GcgoEy).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pham, who remains employed at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas but has not returned to work, seeks unspecified damages in her lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A man visiting Dallas from Liberia, Thomas Eric Duncan, died Oct. 8 at the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pham and another nurse caring for Duncan contracted Ebola but survived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Texas Health Resources spokesman Wendell Watson, in a statement Friday, said the company and the hospital acted responsibly to protect their employees, basing their responses on the most up-to-date federal guidelines and with leading experts at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The hospital also respected Pham's privacy and acted only with her consent, the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A doctor on Oct. 16 videotaped Pham, who was in a hospital bed, in images later made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Nina Pham has gone through the unprecedented challenge of being the first nurse to whom the Ebola virus was transmitted while caring for a patient with Ebola in the U.S.," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our care and compassion for Nina is paramount, and we will continue to show her the utmost courtesy, dignity and respect as a member of the Texas Health family."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since Pham contracted the disease while working for the hospital as an intensive care nurse, her remedy should be a worker's compensation claim, not in civil court, the hospital's response said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I am disappointed but not surprised about the answer THR filed," said Pham's attorney, Charla Aldous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"My hope was that they would come clean and be honest about what happened so that the health care community can learn from the mistakes made."</td></tr>
