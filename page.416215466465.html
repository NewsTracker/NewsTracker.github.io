<h3>Hillary Clinton spotted at Chipotle in Ohio on way to Iowa</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton made a Chipotle pitstop in Maumee, Ohio, on her way from New York to Iowa Monday, with security video showing her and longtime aide Huma Abedin sporting shades as they put in their orders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>General Manager Charles Wright told the Daily News Clinton was in his restaurant at about 1:20 p.m. Monday, ordering a chicken bowl with guacamole, a chicken salad, and a blackberry Izze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wright said Clinton did nothing to attract attention to herself - and it worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"She wasn't, like, obvious and no one made a scene," Wright said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"She just came through like a regular customer - and we treated her just like a regular customer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was the lack of fanfare that helped Clinton have a peaceful lunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Usually with a lady of that stature, you would think she would have security around her," Wright said, but "it was just her and the other lady."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Only one other customer seemed to recognize he was in the presence of a newly minted presidential hopeful and snapped some pictures, Wright said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The two women spent about 25 minutes in the restaurant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wright wasn't sure if they bussed their own trays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Screenshots of the visit spurred a torrent of jokes on Twitter, with some kidding it looked like Clinton and Abedin were sticking up the joint rather than ordering lunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton is traveling by van across the country to reintroduce herself to voters in Iowa after kicking off her campaign Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Her 2016 campaign is expected to lean more heavily on middle-class messaging than the soaring Clinton-centric themes that led to her defeat to Barack Obama in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>One person has been killed in a shooting reported on the Wayne Community College campus in Goldsboro, N.C., authorities say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fresh off Saturday's disastrous turn at first base, A-Rod was in Monday night's series-opener against the Orioles at his old familiar spot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Flight 448 underwent an emergency landing Monday afternoon after a banging was heard from underneath the aircraft, the airline said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tori Spelling isn't ruling out a lawsuit eight days after she was burned at an Encino, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Japanese restaurant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A call about a suspicious package and a possible shooter on a college campus upstate turned out to be a false report, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Pedro Hernandez's confession to killing Etan Patz was a fantasy, and a convicted child molester is the real killer, his lawyer told jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Hillary Clinton made a Chipotle pitstop on her way from New York to Iowa Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A Maryland man and his children were found dead Monday, possibly the victims of carbon monoxide poisoning.</td></tr>
