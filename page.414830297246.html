<h3>News24.com | Security Council calls for Ukraine fighting to stop</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Russia drafted a resolution, adopted unanimously by the 15-member council, in a move that US Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, described as "ironic" given the rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine are backed by Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine fought their way into an encircled government bastion and were battling street to street on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The rebels say the truce does not apply at all to the main battle front at the town of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Russia signs agreements then does everything within its power to undermine them, Russia champions the sovereignty of nations and then acts as if a neighbour's borders do not exist," Power told the Security Council after the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The idea that Russia, which manufactured and continues to escalate the violence in Ukraine has tabled a resolution today calling for the conflict's peaceful solution is ironic to say the least," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The resolution endorsed the peace deal that was reached at all-night talks in the Belarussian capital Minsk last week and called for all parties to implement it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The council expressed "its full respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine" and its "grave concern at the tragic events and violence in eastern regions of Ukraine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It also reaffirmed a resolution adopted by the council in July, which demanded access to the eastern Ukraine site where a Malaysian passenger plane crashed with 298 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Since the very start of the crisis Russia has actively called for a peaceful settlement through inclusive, transparent dialogue between the sides in the internal Ukrainian conflict," Russian UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told the council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We will adhere to this fundamental approach in the future also."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The resolution was adopted shortly after the council issued a press statement on Ukraine calling for all parties to stop fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That British-drafted statement expressed grave concern at continued fighting in and around Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The UN Security Council has held dozens of meetings on the Ukrainian conflict.</td></tr>
