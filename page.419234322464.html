<h3>Taliban condemns 'barbarity' of Islamic State execution video</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kabul: The Taliban condemned a video released this week showing what appeared to be a group of fighters belonging to the radical Islamic State movement killing a group of Afghan prisoners by blowing them up with explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The video, apparently shot in the eastern Afghan province of in June, gave a glimpse into the struggle the Taliban is waging against Islamic State - both considered ultra-hardline groups - for supremacy of the Islamist insurgency in Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"A horrific video was released yesterday showing kidnappers who associate themselves with Daesh [Islamic State] brutally martyring several white-bearded tribal elders and villagers with explosives," a statement posted on the Taliban's website said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Taliban, which itself if frequently accused of brutality against Afghan government soldiers that it captures, said prisoners should never be treated in such a manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This offence and other such brutal actions by a few irresponsible ignorant individuals under the guise of Islam and Muslims are intolerable," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Groups associated with Islamic State have made growing inroads in Afghanistan in recent years, attracting fighters and support away from the Taliban by preaching a more extreme form of Islamist militancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The video contained a message in Arabic and a Pashto language commentary which said that a group of what it called "apostates" had been captured following a battle between IS fighters, Taliban and Afghan government forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The bound captives appear to have been local men who had fought with or helped the Taliban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After showing the explosion which killed the men, the video ends with a message in Arabic urging local people to heed the lesson.</td></tr>
