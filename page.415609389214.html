<h3>Retreating Boko Haram leaves mass of throat-slit corpses near Nigerian town</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DAMASAK, Nigeria - Soldiers from Niger and Chad who liberated the Nigerian town of Damasak from Boko Haram militants have discovered the bodies of at least 70 people, many with their throats slit, scattered under a bridge, a Reuters witness said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In what appeared to be an execution site for the Islamist group, the bodies were strewn beneath the concrete bridge on one of the main roads leading out of the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At least one had its head completely severed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The bodies were partially mummified by the dry desert air, suggesting that the killings had taken place some time ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Boko Haram has killed thousands of people in a six-year insurgency aimed at establishing an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Damasak was seized by the Islamist group in November but recaptured by troops from Niger and Chad on Saturday as part of a multinational effort to wipe out the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chadian soldiers, who said the bodies were discovered on Thursday, spoke of at least 100 corpses in the area around the dry river bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A Reuters witness was able to count at least 70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A trail of blackened blood was visible along the side of the bridge facing the bodies, suggesting they had been thrown off the side after being killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Among the dead was the imam of the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>All but around 50 of the town's residents had fled by the time Damasak was recaptured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Those who remained were mostly too old or too sick to leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Reuters witness said a strong smell of decomposition in many parts of town suggested there could be more bodies concealed there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chad's military spokesman Colonel Azem Bermandoa said the Chadians had asked Nigeria's military to occupy the town, which lies close to the border with Niger, and would remain there until Nigerian troops arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The regional offensive launched this year with Chad, Niger and Cameroon comes as Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and biggest economy, prepares to hold presidential elections on March 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At the start of this year, Boko Haram controlled around 20 local government areas, a territory the size of Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>With the help of its foreign allies, Nigeria's army said on Tuesday it had pushed the rebels out of all but three districts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Thursday, however, two security sources told Reuters that Boko Haram had killed at least 10 people in the town of Gamburu, on the border with Cameroon, demonstrating it can still attack civilians despite being forced into retreat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to tackle the insurgency.</td></tr>

<h3>Shortfall Of Neurosurgeons Predicted To Treat Common Brain Injury, Study Says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The study also revealed a projected shortage of neurosurgeons to handle the increased number of patients expected to be diagnosed from this condition, typically the result of falls and other trauma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The research was published online, March 20 in the Journal of Neurosurgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bleeding on the surface of the brain, also known as a subdural hemorrhage or subdural hematoma, is typically the result of head trauma or falls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Subdural hematomas are more common in the older population due to greater atrophy of the brain, increased use of blood-thinning medications and atrophy of the blood vessels located on the brain surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>SDHs are also more common in those with a history of alcohol abuse, partly due to the fact that they sustain multiple falls, along with the ability of alcohol to increase the risk for bleeding itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's important to understand even minor head injuries can result in bleeding on the surface of the brain which may accumulate over time and could potentially result in lead to serious neurologic complications leading to motor weakness or long term cognitive deficits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The nature of the trauma can be so trivial that a large percentage of persons with SDHs cannot remember hitting their head or sustaining any brain trauma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While healthcare providers understand that particular types of patients have a greater risk of sustaining a SDH, actual rates of patients sustaining a SDH incidence have not been reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dr. Uzma Samadani, Chief of Neurosurgery at New York Harbor Health Care System and Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery, Psychiatry, Neuroscience and Physiology at NYU Langone, examined projected incidence rates for chronic SDH in civilian populations, and U.S. Veterans Administration (VA).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Researchers evaluated data from civilian incidence rates from Japan and Finland as well as from the VA hospital visits where SDHs were diagnosed, in order to create a mathematical model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The model, which accounted for alcohol consumption, age and gender, aimed to predict the incidence of SDH that would occur from 2012-2040, coinciding with an aging population.</td></tr>
