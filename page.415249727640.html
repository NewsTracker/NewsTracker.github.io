<h3>BP signs $12B deal to develop Egypt gas field</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BP said in a statement that the investment is "a vote of confidence in Egypt's investment climate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The West Nile Delta project aims to produce 5 trillion cubic feet of gas and 55 million barrels of condensate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Production is expected to begin in 2017 and reach up to 1.2 billion cubic feet a day, or about 25 percent of Egypt's current production.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>BP Group Chief Executive Bob Dudley says the project is his company's "largest foreign direct investment in Egypt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The announcement comes days ahead of a major economic conference aimed at boosting foreign investment in the country, which is still reeling from years of unrest following the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Thursday, Egypt's Investment Minister Ashraf Salman said the government hopes to attract up to $35 billion for about 50 projects at the conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Egypt has already attracted some $1.3 billion in foreign investment in the first quarter of the fiscal year, Salman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said the government hopes to reach $8 billion by the end of the fiscal year in June, nearly double the amount from the previous year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>BP's North Africa Regional President Hesham Mekawi described the gas project as "a critical milestone in the Egyptian oil and gas history. It marks the start of a major national project to add significant production to the domestic market."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rising consumption has outstripped Egypt's domestic production, and over the past year Egyptians have endured prolonged power outages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The government has meanwhile struggled to maintain energy subsidies- estimated at around one fifth of the budget in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Egypt's major gas fields, most over 10 years old, are maxing out, and new ones won't start producing for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Oil and gas companies have balked at new investments, citing lingering instability and the government's insolvency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The ministry currently owes at least $4.5 billion to international oil and gas companies.</td></tr>
