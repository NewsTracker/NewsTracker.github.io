<h3>Bali nine executions: A low in Indonesian-Australians relations, experts say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The withdrawal of Australia's ambassador to Indonesia reflects deep-seated problems in the relationship between the two nations, says one of Australia's foremost defence analysts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Australian Strategic Policy Institute executive director Peter Jennings said the withdrawal of ambassador Paul Grigson, announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Wednesday following the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, symbolised just how unhappy the federal government was with Indonesia's handling of the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I think the biggest significance of this is what it tells you about Tony Abbott and Julie Bishop's personal perspective right now," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Having seen their [Wednesday morning] press conference, it's clearly one of deep hurt over how the issue has been handled. In the last 48 to 72 hours or so, it seems Indonesia seemingly to wanted to inflict the maximum hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I think that reflects a deep-seated problem in the relationship which we will see play out over a quite a while."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Before the executions, former Labor foreign minister Bob Carr told Fairfax Media that the withdrawal of the ambassador should be avoided, saying it created a new difficulty about how and when the ambassador would return, while former Australian ambassador to Indonesia John McCarthy said the executions would taint Australia's relations with President Joko for the remainder of his leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Wednesday, Mr Jennings said the decision by Indonesia to give notice of the pair's pending execution on Anzac Day - despite a request from Australia not to do so - had been a tipping point in the deterioration of relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The Indonesians refused to take that request, that has had quite an impact," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Now, Mr Jennings said, there would simply be a pause in government-to-government relations for a number of months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Australian National University Indonesia expert Greg Fealy said it was likely the recall of the ambassador, foreshadowed on Monday, would be understood by Indonesia particularly as Brazil and the Netherlands had reacted the same way after two of those nations' citizens were executed in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This [the withdrawal] is a manageable issue, certainly more so than something that would be seen as punitive, such as the withdrawal of aid," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The recall of the ambassador is something the Indonesians will probably understand; it is consistent with what they have said about countries doing everything they can do to defend the lives of their citizens."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The execution of the pair, Professor Fealy said, marked a low in relations between the two countries - but not one as serious as the East Timor crisis in 1999 nor the revelations that Australia had hacked the phone of former president Susila Bambang Yudhoyono.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And a third expert, the president of the West Australian-based Indonesia Institute Ross Taylor, urged Australia to proceed with care after withdrawing its ambassador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"A ban or partial withdrawal by Australian companies from doing business in Indonesia now would hardly be noticed in Jakarta," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It is us who needs the business, and it is us who must consider our response, in light of these executions, very carefully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Rather than to precipitate a bitter 'tit-for-tat' response from Indonesia's young and inexperienced government, a better way maybe to work is to build the relationship with our northern neighbour and assist them to develop as a young, vibrant and hopefully civil society."</td></tr>
