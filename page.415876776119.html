<h3>Kenya Trip Will Fire Up Obama's Critics</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There's more evidence of President Barack Obama's newfound sense of liberation: He plans a trip to Kenya, the homeland of his father, in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>By visiting Kenya, Obama risks focusing new attention on the "birther" conspiracy theory that has surrounded him for years, based on the false idea that he was born in Kenya and not the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Spreading this fiction has been part of an effort to undermine Obama's legitimacy, since the Constitution requires that every president be native born.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His father, Barack Obama Sr., was from Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His mother, Ann Dunham, was from Kansas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>President Obama was born in Hawaii.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The trip is also certain to raise hackles among those who fault Obama for gallivanting around the world at taxpayer expense when he should be tending to business in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And the trip to Africa will have a very high price tag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Obama's 2013 trip there may have cost an estimated $100 million, according to media reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Other presidents have gone to Africa, including Bill Clinton in 1998 and George W. Bush in 2003 and 2008, and these costs were also high although the exact amounts weren't released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some critics are already blasting the trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>John Sununu, former governor of New Hampshire and a longtime Republican leader, told Fox News Monday: "His trip back to Kenya is going to create a lot of chatter and commentary amongst the hard right, who still don't see him as having been born in the U.S."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sununu added: "I personally think he's just inciting some chatter on an issue that should have been dead a long time ago."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sununu also said, "He's going to take advantage of the last two years and go to all the places he wants to go."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>White House aides say Obama's visit is worthwhile because he will attend the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, hosted by Kenya, that will highlight economic progress in Africa and the need for investment in Africa and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>White House aides declined to discuss whether Obama would meet with his African relatives while he is there, but such meetings are considered likely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Obama has visited Kenya before, but it was prior to his 2008 election to the presidency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As president, he has made three trips to Sub-Saharan Africa but not to Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>One reason he hasn't gone there is because the nation's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, was indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Those charges were dropped last December, making the visit less controversial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Agreeing to visit Kenya follows a pattern of new boldness by Obama as his presidency winds down and as he tries to avoid being considered a lame duck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He is moving aggressively to limit climate change, change the immigration system, partially normalize U.S. relations with Cuba, and use executive orders and his unilateral presidential authority to bypass congressional Republicans who have blocked much of his agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Other presidents have visited the homelands of their ancestors and they reaped big public relations bonanzas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Among the examples were John F. Kennedy's trip to Ireland in 1963, Ronald Reagan's trip to Ireland in 1984, and Bill Clinton's visits there in 1995 and 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The crowds were large and enthusiastic, and there was considerable resonance with Irish-Americans at home.</td></tr>
