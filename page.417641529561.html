<h3>Nigerian summit to be "decisive" for Boko Haram task force - Benin</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PARIS, June 9 (Reuters) - Countries waging a regional fight against the Nigerian Islamist militant group Boko Haram will take significant steps towards establishing a joint task force when they meet on Thursday in Abuja, Benin's president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boko Haram has killed thousands and displaced around 1.5 million people during a six-year insurgency, seeking to establish an Islamic emirate and extending its reach into neighbouring Chad and Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At start of the year, it controlled territory about the size of Belgium in northeast Nigeria, but a loosely coordinated offensive by Nigeria's army and troops from Chad, Cameroon and Niger has pushed it out of most of those areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nigeria's neighbours have been urging closer coordination and the deployment of a joint task force, headquartered in the Chadian capital N'Djamena.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But diplomats say the process has been slowed down by Nigeria's reservations about foreign troops operating on its soil and by its presidential election in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Benin's Thomas Boni Yayi said the new president, Muhammadu Buhari, was "very determined".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The discussions we have had with him reassure us," he told reporters after talks with French President Francois Hollande in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We are going to put an end to this odious phenomenon ... This summit will be decisive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The defence chiefs of Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Chad and Benin were meeting in Abuja on Tuesday to lay the groundwork for the task force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Benin has not deployed any troops against Boko Haram yet, but has agreed in principle to join the force.</td></tr>
