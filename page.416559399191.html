<h3>Former Kandahar combat commander Jonathan Vance named as Canada?s next defence chief</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prime Minister Stephen Harper has named Lt.-Gen. Jonathan Vance as Canada's new chief of defence staff, replacing Gen. Tom Lawson as the military's top officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Harper said the change of command ceremony, and Vance's promotion to the rank of general, "will take place in the coming weeks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a statement, Harper said Vance "has had a distinguished career in the Canadian Armed Forces with significant experience defending Canadian sovereignty at home and around the globe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Lieutenant-General Vance will provide strong leadership for the Canadian Armed Forces at a critical time in its history. His years working with key allied forces and partners, his combat experience, his strategic leadership, and his experience in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism warfare will help position the Canadian Armed Forces for continued success."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Vance had been favoured for the position, after Lawson announced he would be stepping down from the post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lawson, a former fighter pilot, said earlier this year that he would step down after two-and-a-half years in the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Vance currently serves as the country's joint operations commander, and has been the face of high-profile public briefings on the combat mission against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Aside from twice being task force commander in Kandahar - in 2009 and again in 2010 - Vance has also served in other key posts, including head of the strategic joint staff, the military's nerve centre in Ottawa.</td></tr>
