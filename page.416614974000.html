<h3>A look at the knowns and unknowns in the Baltimore case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - A week and a half after 25-year-old Freddie Gray died, there are still many unanswered questions about the explosive case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WHY DID POLICE STOP HIM?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police say they went after him after he fled at the sight of an officer in a drug-infested neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Why he ran is anyone's guess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police say they later found a switchblade in his pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>During the arrest, officers on bicycles chased him down, pinned him to the sidewalk and then lifted him and took him, his legs dragging on the ground, to a police van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He pleaded for an inhaler during the arrest and asked repeatedly for medical help during the half-hour ride to the station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He died a week later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Police say Gray died of a "significant spinal injury."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>An attorney for the family says his spine was "80 percent severed in the neck area."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An autopsy has been done, and while the findings have not been released, police say no bodily injury was evident during the post mortem and no limbs were broken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>SO HOW AND WHEN DID THE INJURY HAPPEN?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That's the big question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's not clear whether he got hurt during the arrest, the ride, or both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Police say he was in leg irons and handcuffs in the van but was not belted in, a violation of policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That has raised suspicions that Gray was deliberately taken on a "rough ride" to teach him a lesson and was injured when he got thrown around the back of the vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Police say they have interviewed a second, unidentified man who was in the van, and he said the driver wasn't driving erratically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police say this man didn't see anyone harm Gray but heard Gray "thrashing about."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>WHAT ABOUT THE OFFICERS INVOLVED?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Police have suspended six in the meantime, and five of them have given statements to investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The sixth declined to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>All of them joined the force between 1997 and 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Baltimore police are conducting an internal investigation and say they will share their findings by Friday with the Baltimore state's attorney for possible prosecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It is not known when or if those findings will be made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating, as is the Gray family attorney.</td></tr>
