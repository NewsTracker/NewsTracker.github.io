<h3>Greek stock market reopens with 22% loss</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Greek stock exchange opened after a month on August 3, and immediately fell by 22%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece's main stock index plunged over 22% as it reopened Monday after a five-week closure, giving investors their first opportunity since June to react to the country's latest economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bank stocks suffered the most, hitting or nearing the daily trading limit of a 30% loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Athens Stock Exchange and Greek banks were closed on June 29, when controls on money withdrawals and transfers were imposed to prevent a collapse in the banking system due to a run on deposits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Banks have since reopened, while maintaining strict withdrawal limits.</td></tr>
