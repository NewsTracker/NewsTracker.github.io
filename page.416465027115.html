<h3>US regulators recall 10-minute Ebola test</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>US regulators have issued an international recall for a 10-minute Ebola blood test made by a California-based company, saying it has not been proven to work and could put lives at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"A recall has been issued for the LuSys Laboratories, Inc., Ebola Virus One-Step Test Kits because the FDA has not cleared or approved the kits for use or sale," said the Food and Drug Administration in a statement emailed to reporters on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The results obtained from these test kits have not demonstrated to be accurate and should not be used as in vitro diagnostic tests for Ebola infection."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The recall was initially issued in mid-March and applies to test kits exported to Denmark, Sierra Leone and Canada between October 2014 and January 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The FDA did not say how many tests were sent out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The recall is described as a Class I, "the most serious type of recall and involve(s) situations in which there is a reasonable probability that use of these products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death," the FDA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"A false positive result may be life-threatening by potentially placing the patient in an isolation cohort with Ebola-infected patients."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Contacted by AFP, a company representative in San Diego said early trials have shown the test to be 86 percent accurate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The problem with the FDA came down to a labeling error, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The equipment had not been properly labeled "for research purposes only."</td></tr>
