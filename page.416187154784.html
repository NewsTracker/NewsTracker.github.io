<h3>Clinton to announce presidential bid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton has launched her bid to become the first woman to win the White House, and announced a campaign tour to showcase her support for "everyday Americans".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I'm running for president," Clinton, a former secretary of state and US first lady, said in a video on her campaign website that went live on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion, so you can do more than just get by. You can get ahead, and stay ahead," she said in the two-minute video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times. But the deck is still stacked in favour of those at the top," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton, 67, becomes the third major figure to announce her US presidential aspirations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Senator Marco Rubio is widely expected to announce his campaign on Monday, and ex-Florida governor Jeb Bush is actively considering a run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She also said in the video that she will soon be "hitting the road to earn your vote".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Presumptive campaign chairman John Podesta told donors and other backers in Sunday emails that Clinton's first campaign stops will be in Iowa - the state that votes first in the primary process early next year to decide the parties' nominees - and that "a formal kick-off event" will be held next month.</td></tr>
