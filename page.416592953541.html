<h3>Aust to recall ambassador to Indonesia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Abbott government will recall Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson following the executions of Bali Nine drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the executions as "cruel and unnecessary".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Bali Nine ring leaders were among eight foreign nationals shot dead by firing squad on the island of Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We deplore what's been done and this cannot be simply business as usual," he told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Abbott said Australia's reaction could not be "simply business as usual".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"For that reason ... our ambassador will be withdrawn for consultations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Abbott said Mr Grigson would be withdrawn once arrangements for the Chan and Sukumaran families had been sorted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The prime minister acknowledged it was "unusual, indeed unprecedented" for Australia to withdraw an ambassador, but the government thought it was necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Whatever people think of the death penalty, whatever people think of drug crime, the fact is that these two families have suffered an appalling tragedy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"As a parent, as a family member myself, I feel for these families at what is a very, very difficult time."</td></tr>
