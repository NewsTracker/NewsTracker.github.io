<h3>Greek contagion risks may be higher than you think</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A perception in financial markets that Greece exiting the euro zone would have limited knock-on effects is misguided, some analysts say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Euro zone officials meet in Latvia this week to discuss a rescue deal between Greece and its creditors amid growing talk that time is running out for Athens to avoid defaulting on its debt and being ejected from the 19-member euro zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"UBS does not believe, as its base case that Greece, will leave the euro," Paul Donovan, UBS global economist, said in a video published by the bank's research team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"However, there seems to be a belief in financial markets that if Greece were to be forced from the euro area it should be regarded as an isolated incident," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This belief, seems to us, to be dangerous."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Donovan said that the view that Greek problems were distinct from the rest of the euro zone was reflected in recent online search patterns: Searches on Google for the term "Grexit" had soared, while those for "euro crisis" or "euro collapse" had not, even though they did during the 2012 euro zone debt crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the latest crisis, government bond yields in peripheral euro zone countries-in the past viewed as most vulnerable to any Greek contagion-have not followed Greek bond yields higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greek bond yields have risen sharply this week, reflecting the greater risk attached to holding them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece's benchmark 10-year bond yielded over 13 percent on Tuesday, well above Spain's 10-year yield at 1.48 percent and Portuguese yields at 2.12 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Although this can partly be explained by the European Central Bank's (ECB) massive monetary stimulus program, which is putting downward pressure on yields, it also reflects diminished contagion fears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I don't get the sense that there is a widespread view that if a deal is not made and Greece exits the euro zone, you would have this massive contagion effect," Ben White, Politico's chief economic correspondent, told CNBC on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>UBS' Donovan said any contagion from a Grexit would come from the banking system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said that if Greece did leave the euro area, any money in Greek banks would be redenominated into a new currency, which would probably plunge in value, distressing depositors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Depositors in other countries may think their holdings are safe, since their country is not going to leave the euro zone--or they may decide to avoid any risk and withdraw their savings, Donovan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Why take the risk that your country probably won't leave the euro, if it's a relatively simple operation to withdraw your savings and hold them in cash?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Donovan asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"A euro held as cash today is a euro tomorrow," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"A euro held in a bank account today may be an entirely different currency tomorrow, if the irrevocable monetary union has been revoked. Investors are thus likely to choose cash over deposits."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Antonio Roldan Mones, southern Europe analyst at Eurasia Group, said there were valid reasons why financial markets now viewed the contagion risk from a Greek crisis differently to a few years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In particular, the ECB has established institutions to come to the aid of any member state in trouble, it has a 1 trillion euro ($1.1 trillion) monetary stimulus program in place and smaller economies such as Portugal and Spain have taken steps to strengthen their banking system, Mones said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"But it's true once you open the possibility of exit, once the irrevocability clause is no longer credible, then if there are problems - a populist party comes to power or the growth numbers go down - then the possibility of exit is there and markets may start betting on it," Roldan Mones told CNBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The other issue is that there are still structural challenges in some of these countries," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Portugal still has a large debt-to-GDP ratio of around 130 percent, growth is better than it was but still weak; there are still problems in the banking sector, so I wouldn't discount the possibility of contagion if things go south in Greece."</td></tr>
