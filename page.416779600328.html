<h3>Israel's Netanyahu races to form narrow coalition government</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) " Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is racing to put together a governing coalition with a deadline only hours away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu was holding furious consultations Wednesday with the hawkish Jewish Home Party in order to secure a narrow 61-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If he fails by the end of the day, President Reuven Rivlin must appoint someone else the task of forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After Netanyahu's Likud Party won March 17 elections with 30 seats, it seemed he would have a relatively easy time forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But talks stalled and were thrown into a tizzy this week when Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman unexpectedly stepped down and announced his nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party was joining the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett has a rocky relationship with Netanyahu.</td></tr>
