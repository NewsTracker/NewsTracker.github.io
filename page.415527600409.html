<h3>Luke Shaw will be a Manchester United star, says club's former left back Denis Irwin</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Irwin, one of the most decorated defenders in United's history, tipped Shaw to star for United shortly after he signed for the club, but the teenager has had a mixed maiden campaign so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shaw has impressed on a few occasions, but injury has prevented him from fulfilling his potential.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 19-year-old was made to train on his own after turning up to pre-season out of shape and he was then hit by hamstring and ankle problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The left-back has started just 12 Premier League games so far, but Irwin is sure the club will start seeing a return on their 31.5million investment once his injury troubles are over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'I have no doubt he will be a great player for us in years to come,' Irwin told Press Association Sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'Until he gets a run of games I don't think you are going to see the quality Luke Shaw can bring to a side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>United beat strong competition from Shaw's boyhood club Chelsea to sign the defender from Southampton last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Irwin believes it is unreasonable to expect too much too soon from a player who only made his Premier League debut in November 2012, regardless of how much United paid for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'He has had a big couple of years,' said Irwin, who played 529 times for the club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'He had a couple of years at Southampton, he had a big-money move here and he was involved in a World Cup at just 18-years-old so the spotlight has been on him through no fault of his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'When you are 19 you will make mistakes and you will learn from them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Shaw, who has been suffering from another hamstring injury recently, sat out United's 3-0 win over Spurs on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The win tightened United's grip on fourth place and they now sit just two points behind second-placed Manchester City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Irwin was impressed by the performance against Spurs and he now hopes the team will produce similar performances against their top-four rivals in the coming weeks to secure the Champions League football which they have missed so dearly this term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'It was a big loss for us when we didn't qualify for the Champions League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It's been a strange year,' said Irwin, who was part of the team that won the trophy in the most dramatic fashion in 1999.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'We have missed Champions League football, I have missed big teams coming here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'There are some big matches coming up in the round of 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We are not involved and it's not nice watching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Denis Irwin was speaking at the launch of bwin Manchester United Casino - the world's first club-based real money casino app which is available now on Android from bwin.com/manutdcasino and will be available soon on iOS through the App Store.</td></tr>

<h3>'Super Mario' to go mobile as Nintendo ventures into smartphone games</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nintendo, which already warned its annual operating profit would halve on weak console sales, said on Tuesday it was teaming up with online gaming firm DeNA Co Ltd to develop and operate gaming apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The two companies will also launch later this year an online membership service accessible on mobile devices as well as Nintendo's existing Wii U console and the portable 3DS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"This will allow us to build a bridge between smart devices and gaming consoles," Nintendo president Satoru Iwata told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It doesn't mean smart devices will eat away at gaming consoles, it will create an entirely new type of demand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company had so far resisted these calls, pinning its hopes on hit games such as Mario Kart 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But in January, it halved its operating earnings target for the fiscal year through March to 20 billion yen ($211 million), citing weak 3DS sales in the year-end holiday season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Under the partnership, Nintendo and DeNA would buy 22 billion yen worth of shares in each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As a result, Nintendo will acquire a 10% stake in DeNA while DeNA will acquire a 1.2% stake in Nintendo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Although Iwata didn't disclose any details about Nintendo's first mobile game, he said it would not be a hand-me-down from the company's famed console titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He also said Nintendo was currently developing NX, a new gaming platform, but declined to give further details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For DeNA, which grew from a startup launched in 1999 to a major online gaming company, a tie-up with Nintendo will help it regain momentum lost in the past two years as users moved on to more popular gaming apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>DeNA mainly develops games played on browsers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As a result of the capital alliance, Nintendo will become the second largest shareholder of DeNA after its founder, Tomoko Namba, who has a 13.1% stake.</td></tr>
