<tr><td>11</td><td>She said there were reports of complete and utter devastation in the capital of Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Temporary dwellings, which most Vanuatu people live in, corrugated iron houses have been completely annihilated," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Nothing left in terms of local housing. Some of the larger structures are also gone as well. We are expecting a fairly chaotic scene this morning."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She said no-one would have any shelter over their heads for the next couple of weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Oxfam spokeswoman Helen Szoke said the organisation had been unable to contact staff on the ground since last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But before communications went down, she said local staff were giving harrowing reports of the impact of Cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Our staff in Port Vila, they're saying the noise was incredible, just the strength of the wind," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's going to be some days before we know the full extent to the damage that's been done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Speaking from a hotel shelter on Friday, program director for CARE Australia in Vanuatu, Inga Mepham, told ABC's The World program that people had heeded warnings to take shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It's a thundery noise coming through and obviously things are starting to fly around. We can feel things hitting us at different times," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I think people would still be in disbelief tonight ... certainly we are."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In Fiji, head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the Pacific, Sune Gudnitz, said the storm was the "worst-case scenario".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The most vulnerable will certainly be the people that are living or residing closer to the coastline, which in a place like Vanuatu is a lot of people," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Very few structures I think will be able to withstand a category five cyclone of the magnitude that we are seeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"So we are looking at potentially total destruction of many shelters, residences, especially in the islands south and outside of Port Vila."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Vanuatu's northern islands were the first to feel the destructive force of Pam, the strongest storm to hit the nation of 270,000 people in nearly 30 years.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>Meteorologist Neville Koop, from Fiji's Nadraki Weather Service, said Pam's winds were capable of bringing down even well-built structures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He said they could be more destructive than Cyclone Uma, which killed at least 30 people when it sank two ferries off Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Pam has winds which are much stronger than Vanuatu experienced (in 1987)", he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop issued a statement on Friday urging citizens "to reconsider your need to travel" to Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"We are monitoring the humanitarian impact closely and are preparing a potential response to this emergency," Ms Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Vanuatu's meteorological service warned more bad weather was likely to follow Pam as forecast models showed a separate tropical cyclone heading its way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Cyclone Nathan, a category two storm located off the coast of Queensland, was expected to intensify and possibly hit Vanuatu next week, the service said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The UN's OCHA said Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands could also be affected by Cyclone Nathan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"This could have devastating effects for communities living in areas that have already experienced prolonged rains and other impacts from Tropical Cyclone Pam," OCHA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The bad weather being generated by Cyclone Pam has been felt right across the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In Kiribati, the combination of heavy rain, strong winds and high tides has damaged causeways connecting islets in the most populated area South Tarawa.</td></tr>
