<h3>Older migrants &#039;struggle to access basic services&#039;</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australia's aged care sector needs more interpreters and bilingual staff to meet the needs of clients from non-English speaking backgrounds, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia (FECCA) says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FECCA released a report this week that showed there were 1.3 million Australians aged over 50 from non-English speaking backgrounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report drew on data from the 2011 census, which said 20 per cent of Australians aged 65 years and older were born in non-English speaking countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FECCA forecasted the number of older Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds to grow significantly over coming decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The report found older migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds, especially those with poorer English skills, tended to have poorer health outcomes than other Australians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many aged care facilities failed to provide culturally appropriate care, including a lack of homeland food or traditional medicine, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FECCA chair Joe Caputo said aged care needed to be far more responsive to the nation's cultural diversity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Different communities have got different traditions and different ways of going about and caring for older people," Mr Caputo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"So I think the system has to be flexible enough and understanding of the diversity of the communities that are getting older in Australia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Caputo said it was clear from the report some older Australians from migrant communities preferred for family members to care for them, rather than receive care in aged care facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said this was particularly true for migrants from Greece and Italy, but also for those born in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I think that most people would like to stay at home for as long as possible and they would like to have family members assisting them as they are getting older or getting frail and I think policy-makers can ensure that we put more resources into ensuring that people can stay at home, either looking after themselves or assisting family members who are looking after older people," Mr Caputo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I think that most people would like to stay at home for as long as possible and they would like to have family members assisting them as they are getting older."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>FECCA said one of the greatest health challenges confronting many older Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds was dementia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The report forecasts the number of dementia sufferers from culturally diverse backgrounds is set to grow from 35,000 in 2010 to 120,000 by 2050.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pino Migliorino is the chair of the National Cross Cultural Dementia Network for Alzheimers Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said many dementia sufferers from non-English speaking backgrounds reverted back to their first languages and often needed extra support from bilingual health workers or interpreters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Migliorino said it was critical for policy-makers to work alongside migrant communities to overcome some cultural stigma around dementia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It is an issue for them because what happens is the phenomena tends to be that it's hidden," Mr Migliorino said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It tends to not be presented or people aren't presenting with dementia until far later in the dementia course and at that point, services are far harder to actually access," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"There's also the sense of community shame and sensitivity. So we really do need to work with the communities around dementia," Mr Migliorino added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The FECCA report highlights the changing cultural make-up of Australia's older population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It predicts older migrants from China, Vietnam and India are likely to outnumber those from Greece and Italy over coming decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Adelaide-based Rosa Colanero is the chief executive of Multicultural Aged Care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>She said the current aged care system was not keeping pace with the changing cultural make-up of the population and was failing to provide enough bilingual workers to support them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The Vietnamese, the Chinese and the Indians of the future- they are the emerging communities, particularly the Chinese and the Indians and we will need an aged care service or aged care services that are able to deliver culturally appropriate care to them," Ms Colanero said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The FECCA study was funded by the federal government with the research undertaken by the Australian Population and Migration Research Centre at the University of Adelaide.</td></tr>

<h3>Israel's Netanyahu has slight edge as rivals will compete to form coalition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Power in Israel may be in hands of Kulanu party s Moshe Kahlon, who refused to take sides on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Herzog vows to make every effort to form a coalition government in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to fend off a strong challenge from the country's opposition leader in parliamentary elections Tuesday, emerging from an acrimonious campaign in a slightly better position to form Israel's next government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But with the sides nearly evenly divided, a victory by Netanyahu's Likud Party still was not guaranteed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His chief rival, Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union, said he would make "every effort" to form a government, and an upstart centrist party led by a former Netanyahu ally-turned-rival was set to be the kingmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The country now heads into what could be weeks of negotiations over the makeup of the next coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union, said he would make "every effort" to form a government in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Both Netanyahu and Herzog will now compete for a chance to form a coalition that commands a majority in the 120-seat parliament, a daunting task in Israel's fractured political landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Netanyahu appeared to have a better chance of cobbling together a government with right-wing and religious parties that he calls his "natural allies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Herzog would have to appeal to more ideologically diverse parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Either will likely need the support of Moshe Kahlon, whose new Kulanu party captured nine or 10 seats, according to polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kahlon, whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread-and-butter economic issues, refused to take sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I am loyal to my way," he told his supporters, saying he would work to form a government committed to social justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years, and recent opinion polls had given Herzog a slight lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As the results were announced on the nation's three major TV stations, celebrations erupted at Likud's campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Against all the odds we obtained a great victory for the Likud," Netanyahu told the gathering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Now we must form a strong and stable government that will ensure Israel's security and welfare," he added, in comments aimed at Kahlon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said he had already been in touch with all other nationalist parties in hopes of quickly forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Netanyahu focused his campaign on security issues, while his opponents instead pledged to address the country's high cost of living and accused the leader of being out of touch with everyday people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Herzog also promised to repair tattered ties with the U.S. and to revive peace efforts with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>At a rally of his supporters, Herzog vowed to do his utmost to form a government and said he too had reached out to potential coalition partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In a nod to Kahlon, he said he was committed to forming a "real social reconciliation government" committed to lowering the country's cost of living and reducing gaps between rich and poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Netanyahu's return to power would likely spell trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with President Barack Obama, took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign, staking out a series of hard-line positions that will put him at odds with the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In a dramatic policy reversal, he said he now opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a key policy goal of the White House and the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He also promised to expand construction in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem, the section of the city claimed by the Palestinians as their capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Netanyahu infuriated the White House early this month when he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The speech was arranged with Republican leaders and not coordinated with the White House ahead of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama was confident strong U.S.-Israeli ties would endure far beyond the election regardless of the victor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Palestinians, fed up after years of deadlock with Netanyahu, are now likely to press ahead with their attempts to bring war crimes charges against Israel in the International Criminal Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"What Netanyahu is doing and stating are war crimes and if the international community wants peace it should make Netanyahu accountable for his acts," said Palestinian official Saeb Erekat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He said the Palestinian leadership will meet Thursday to discuss its next steps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Exit polls on Israel's three main TV stations showed Likud and the Zionist Union in a near deadlock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Channels One and 10 gave Likud a 27-26 lead in the 120-seat parliament, while Channel 2 gave Likud a 28-27 edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>That breakdown could change as final results pour in on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Under Israel's fragmented electoral system, either Netanyahu or Herzog will have to court potential partners to secure a 61-seat majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Herzog could potentially try to build a coalition that would rely on support from a new Arab alliance that captured 12 to 13 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But Arab parties have never sat in an Israeli coalition before, complicating any potential deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Stav Shaffir, a leader of the Zionist Union, called the results a "clear vote of no confidence in Netanyahu."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>She said the Zionist Union would wait for the official results before declaring victory or defeat, but claimed Netanyahu's opponents "have a majority."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Netanyahu has ruled out a "unity" government with the Zionist Union that would give him a broad coalition, and Herzog has also been cool to the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>That would indicate the next government will be a narrow majority - a recipe for further instability in which any member could bring it down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The previous government lasted less than two years before crumbling apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>President Reuven Rivlin will now spend the next few days consulting with the various parties, whose leaders will all offer recommendations for who should be prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Based on those consultations, he will ask either Netanyahu or Herzog to begin the process of forming a coalition.</td></tr>
