<h3>Democrats deplore Republican letter to Tehran on nuke talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also weighed in, saying Republicans were either trying to help the Iranians or hurt President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As negotiators rush to reach an accord with Iran by the end of the month, partisan bickering continued on Capitol Hill, prompting Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia to ask, rhetorically: "Is the Senate capable of tackling challenging national security questions in a mature and responsible way?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kaine said the letter freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote to the leaders of Iran amounted to a partisan "sideshow."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The letter, signed by 47 of the Senate's 54 Republicans, including members of the leadership and potential presidential candidates, warned that unless Congress approved it, any nuclear deal they cut with Obama could expire the minute he leaves office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The U.S. and five other nations are working to craft an agreement that would prevent Iran from being able to develop nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tehran insists its nuclear work is peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Republicans worry that Iran is not negotiating in good faith and that a deal would be insufficient and unenforceable, allowing Iran to eventually become a nuclear-armed state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cotton denied undermining Obama's negotiating position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Appearing on MSNBC, he said, "We're making sure that Iran's leaders understand that if Congress doesn't approve a deal, Congress won't accept a deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He accused Iran of seeking "a nuclear umbrella so they can continue to export terrorism around the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif was quoted by the website of Iranian state TV on Tuesday as saying the letter's warning that any nuclear deal could be scrapped once Obama leaves office suggests the United States is "not trustworthy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He called the letter "unprecedented and undiplomatic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earlier, he had dismissed it as a "propaganda ploy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended the letter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If there is not a deal, we've had some of our Democratic friends say the choice is between this deal and war," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"No, the choice is between this deal and greater sanctions because we've finally discovered one thing that works."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a news conference on another issue, Clinton wondered aloud about the purpose of the letter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There appear to be two logical answers: Either these senators were trying to be helpful to the Iranians or harmful to the commander in chief in the midst of high-stakes international diplomacy," Clinton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Either answer does discredit to the letter's signatories."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The signatories include a handful of Republican White House prospects, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued statements suggesting their Senate colleagues were justified in sending the letter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The senators are reacting to reports of a bad deal that will likely enable Iran to become a nuclear state over time," Bush said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Said Walker, "Unless the White House is prepared to submit the Iran deal it negotiates for congressional approval, the next president should not be bound" by it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the GOP letter weakens the American position because it "shows division."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Everything is done to attack," Feinstein said about Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"And that's not what our government should be."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In remarks on the Senate floor, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pronounced the letter reckless, much as it would have been for U.S. lawmakers to "reach out to the Vietnamese" a generation ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He said he hoped it would not cause the negotiations to fail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Democrats didn't always agree with President George W. Bush's foreign policy decisions, but Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said he would have never contemplated writing such a letter when Bush was in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"You can disagree and you can disagree without being disagreeable about issues," Nelson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Kaine spoke about what he called a "rigorously bipartisan" bill - authored by Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee - to allow Congress to review any final agreement with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Corker, one of seven Republicans who did not sign the letter, also lamented the discord.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"There are a lot of frustrations no doubt around the Iran issue and I hope we can move beyond some of the drama to focus, if there's a deal, on its content," Corker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"But also to make sure that Congress has an appropriate role."</td></tr>

<h3>Chechnya's leader vows loyalty to Putin amid Nemtsov probe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin bestowed a state award Monday on the leader of Chechnya, the North Caucasus strongman who hailed the suspected killer of an opposition politician as a "true patriot."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kadyrov drew criticism Sunday from government opponents after praising Zaur Dadayev, a Chechen suspect in the murder of Kremlin foe Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>MOSCOW (AP) - Chechnya's strongman on Tuesday reaffirmed an unwavering loyalty to President Vladimir Putin after receiving a medal seen by some as a move to assuage the feisty Chechen leader after one of his officers was arrested as a suspect in the slaying of a Russian opposition figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ramzan Kadyrov thanked Putin for awarding him the Order of Honor, one of Russia's highest decorations, saying that it would be "the lightest task" for him to sacrifice his life for the Russian leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are infantrymen of the president of Russia!" he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Some observers say the arrest of five suspects accused of involvement in the Feb. 27 slaying of Putin's prominent critic, Boris Nemtsov, could strain Kremlin's relations with Kadyrov, who has run Chechnya like his own fiefdom while relying on federal subsidies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One of the suspects, Zaur Dadaev, was a senior officer in Chechnya's police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A judge said during Saturday's hearing that he confessed to the crime, but Dadaev said in comments carried by the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets Tuesday that he was not guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The newspaper quoted him as telling rights activists who visited him in prison that he hadn't been given a chance to plead innocent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Following his arrest, Kadyrov praised Dadaev as a brave soldier and a deeply religious man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Chechen leader also hailed another suspect, who blew himself up with a grenade when police came to arrest him at his apartment in Chechnya's regional capital, Grozny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kadyrov's comments reflected a degree of defiance following the arrests, a rare occasion when federal law-enforcement agencies dared to prosecute those loyal to the Chechen strongman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Oleg Orlov, the head of Memorial, a respected Russian human rights group, said the arrests and the subsequent award were a message to Kadyrov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"They show Kadyrov that he's not quite his own boss, and some members of his entourage will be punished," Orlov told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's a signal: we will clean the field around you so that you know your place, but you are personally not in trouble yet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Alexei Malashenko, a Caucasus expert with the Carnegie Endowment's Moscow office, said that by awarding Kadyrov with a medal Putin assured him of his personal trust despite strong anti-Kadyrov sentiments in the Russian law-enforcement agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Some people in security services of the Russian Federation don't like Ramzan Kadyrov because it's permitted to him to do everything he wants," Malashenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Putin, Malashenko added, apparently "understands that at the moment it's necessary to use Islam as a political instrument for Ramzan Kadyrov."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"They are like Siamese twins: Kadyrov will certainly not survive without Putin, and it would be difficult for Putin to do without Kadyrov," Malashenko told the AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kadyrov has used generous Kremlin funding to rebuild Chechnya after two separatist wars and has relied on his feared security force of former rebels like himself to stabilize the North Caucasus province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>International human rights groups have accused Kadyrov of rampant abuses, including arbitrary arrest, torture and extrajudicial killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Kremlin has counted on Kadyrov to pacify Chechnya, turning a blind eye to his campaign to enforce Islamic rules, including mandatory headscarves for women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In the wake of the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris, which published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, Kadyrov called those who defended the French satirical magazine his "personal enemies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He also staged a massive rally in Grozny to press the point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Russia's top investigative agency has said that Nemtsov's criticism of the Charlie Hebdo attackers could have been a motive behind his killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Echoing the claim, Kadyrov said on his Instagram account Saturday that Dadaev was shocked by the magazine's cartoons and commentaries in their support.</td></tr>
