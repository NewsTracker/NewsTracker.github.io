<h3>For migrants used to danger, Islamic State poses new threat</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - Tesfay Kidane's troubles began with a simple request: He wanted to go to his brother's wedding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Doing mandatory national service in the east African country of Eritrea, Kidane asked his commander for permission for a leave to attend the wedding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The request was denied, starting a chain of events that friends say sent Kidane on a desperate trek across the Egyptian desert, into an Israeli detention center, and then back to Africa, culminating with his apparent death at the hands of Islamic State captors in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His tale reflects the deep sense of desperation that has driven hundreds of thousands of Africans to risk their lives as they flee war, poverty and hardship, and the struggle that Israel and European countries face as they cope with an unwanted and overwhelming influx of new arrivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kidane, who was about 30, is believed to have been among dozens of Christian Africans who were shot or beheaded on a Libyan beach in a video released by the Islamic State group this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are really sorry. We are very sad," said Aman Beyene, an Eritrean migrant who said he was friends with Kidane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He was a very kind person. He was a hard worker."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While the identities of the dead have not been officially confirmed, Beyene, speaking from the Israeli detention center where he knew Kidane, said he and other members of Israel's Eritrean migrant community instantly recognized their compatriot in the video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Beyene said the community had spoken to someone in Libya who saw the incident, and the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, an Israeli advocacy group that helps African migrants, said Kidane was a relative of one of its workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The hotline said it believed that two other people seen in the video had also spent time in Israeli detention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kidane's story mirrors those of tens of thousands of Africans who have made their way to Israel in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Most of these migrants came from Eritrea - a nation with one of the world's most dismal human rights records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Among the many abuses that citizens face is years of forced military conscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Beyene, himself a former Eritrean conscript, said "national service" is grueling and boring work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said that after being barred from going to his brother's wedding, Kidane made plans to sneak away but was arrested three days before the ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He immediately decided to leave the country," Beyene said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Kidane took a perilous land route through war-torn Sudan, and with the help of smugglers, through Egypt's Sinai desert into Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At first, the Africans were welcomed into Israel - a country with a long history of serving as a refuge for Jews fleeing persecution and hardship - and found menial jobs in hotels and restaurants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kidane worked as a dishwasher in a Tel Aviv restaurant, Beyene said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But as their numbers grew, Israel began to take a hard line, saying the swelling numbers of Africans were threatening the country's Jewish character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu built a fence along the Egyptian border that has all but halted the influx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Authorities, meanwhile, began cracking down on the migrants, making it harder for them to work, and sending some of them, including Kidane and Beyene, to a newly built detention center in the isolated Negev desert.</td></tr>
