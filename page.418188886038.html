<h3>Zuckerberg: The Future Of Facebook Is Telepathy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook's founder says one day people will be able to send "full rich thoughts" to each other using technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a question and answer session on his Facebook page, one person asked what the future of Facebook could look like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said he thinks that one day people will be able to send emotional experiences to each other, which would be "the ultimate communication technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"One day, I believe we'll be able to send full rich thoughts to each other directly using technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"You'll just be able to think of something and your friends will immediately be able to experience it too if you'd like."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He added: "We used to just share in text, and now we post mainly with photos. In the future video will be even more important than photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"After that, immersive experiences like VR will become the norm. And after that, we'll have the power to share our full sensory and emotional experience with people whenever we'd like."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said devices worn "all the time" would allow us to "improve our experience and communication".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He was also asked about Facebook's real name policy - which has seen drag queens and Native Americans among others being kicked off the network for not using their birth names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But he insisted the policy was not as strict as had been made out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said: "Real name does not mean your legal name. Your real name is whatever you go by and what your friends call you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If your friends all call you by a nickname and you want to use that name on Facebook, you should be able to do that. In this way, we should be able to support everyone using their own real names, including everyone in the transgender community."</td></tr>
