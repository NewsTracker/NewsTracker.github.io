<h3>Tunisia gunmen known to authorities; 2 Spaniards hid all night in fear</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The attack Wednesday on Tunisia's Bardo National Museum left 23 dead, scores wounded and threatens both Tunisia's fledgling democracy and its struggling tourism industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the worst attack at a tourist site in Tunisia in years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Razor wire ringed the Bardo museum on Thursday and security forces guarded major thoroughfares in Tunis, the capital, as authorities hunted for two or three more people believed to have been involved in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Two of the gunmen were killed Wednesday by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The attack spells oceans of trouble for the tourism industry, which brings throngs of foreigners every year to Tunisia's Mediterranean beaches, desert oases and ancient Roman ruins - and which had just started to recover after years of slump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Two major cruise ships whose passengers had been among the victims left the port of Tunis early Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Spanish man and a pregnant Spanish woman who had been inside the museum during the attack hid in the building all night in fear and were retrieved safely Thursday morning by security forces, Tunisia's health minister told the Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Health Minister Said Aidi said the death toll rose Thursday to 23 people, including 18 foreign tourists, with almost 50 people wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Five Tunisians were killed, including two attackers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Aidi said all the injuries came from bullet wounds, and that several victims were brought in without identity documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Moncef Hamdoun, an official with the Charles Nicolle hospital where many victims were taken, said seven of the dead remain unidentified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He listed the others who were slain as: three Japanese women, a Spanish man and a Spanish woman, a Colombian woman, an Australian man, a British woman, a Belgian woman, a Frenchman and a Polish man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid, in an interview with France's RTL radio, said Tunisia was working with other countries to learn more about the attackers, identified as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They were killed by security services in a raid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said Laabidi had been flagged to intelligence, although not for "anything special."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tunisia has faced scattered extremist violence, and a disproportionately large number of Tunisians have joined Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Twitter accounts associated with the group praised the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ifriqiyah Media, which has aired claims from Tunisian extremists in the past, posted what it said were details about the attack, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The post calls on Muslims to attack tourists, but does not say who orchestrated the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Legislator Bochra Belhaj Hmida, of the secular majority party Nida Tunis, told the AP that about 2,000 suspected terrorists are believed to be in Tunisia, many of whom joined extremists in Iraq or Syria, then returned home.</td></tr>

<h3>Target proposes to pay $10M to settle data breach lawsuit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson granted preliminary approval of the settlement after a hearing Thursday in St. Paul, Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The move will allow people to begin filing claims ahead of another hearing for final approval, which was scheduled for Nov. 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>People affected by the breach can file for up to $10,000 with proof of their losses, including unauthorized charges, higher fees or interest rates, and lost time dealing with the problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Target really needs to be commended for being willing to step up," Magnuson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Target's data breach in 2013 exposed details of as many as 40 million credit and debit card accounts and hurt its holiday sales that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company offered free credit monitoring for affected customers and overhauled its security systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The settlement would also require Minneapolis-based Target to appoint a chief information security officer, keep a written information security program and offer security training to its workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It would be required to maintain a process to monitor for data security events and respond to such events deemed to present a threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are pleased to see the process moving forward and look forward to its resolution," Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in an emailed statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Claims will mostly be submitted and processed online through a dedicated website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Vincent Esades, an attorney for Target customers, said after the hearing that the settlement could end up costing Target $25 million, when attorneys' fees and administrative costs are added in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said consumers will likely be able to start filing claims around April 30, and 100 million people may be eligible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Consumers can claim up to $10,000 if they can document unreimbursed losses; after those claims are paid out, the rest of the settlement funds will be divided among consumers who state under oath that they suffered a qualifying loss, but don't have documentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>People who've already been fully reimbursed aren't eligible, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Esades said customers who opt out of the settlement have the right to object.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Since the funds can't be paid out until all appeals are resolved, he said, the earliest that customers would see any money would be early next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Target attorney David McDowell declined to comment after the hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The chain has worked hard to lure back customers that were hesitant to shop there after the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Over the 2014 holiday season, Target offered free shipping on all items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It recently announced that it was cutting its minimum online purchase to qualify for free shipping in half to $25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And on Wednesday the retailer said it will now allow returns for up to a year for its private and exclusive brands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Target's bounce back from a turbulent stretch including the data breach and exit from Canada has been met with optimism on Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The retailer's stock traded above $80 for the first time Monday, reaching another in a string of all-time highs that it began to log just before the crucial holiday shopping season began in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Earlier this month, Target said it would lay off about 1,700 people, eliminate another 1,400 unfilled positions and cut up to $2 billion in costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It will also focus more on technology to boost online sales growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The latter move will involve about $1 billion aimed at beefing up business from shoppers who are more likely to shop online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Target shares fell 46 cents to close Thursday at $80.60.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Its shares are up 35.5 percent over the past year.</td></tr>
