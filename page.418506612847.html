<h3>Facebook close sets speed record for $250 billion market cap</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook stumbled after its IPO, but the company's stock has thrived in the last couple of years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It seems like just yesterday that Facebook Inc. went public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Now its market value has topped $250 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The social network company's 2.4 percent climb to a record close on Monday made it the first company in the Standard & Poor's 500 index to breach that market cap so quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The previous record holder was Google Inc., which took about eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Facebook's rapid ascent may indicate investor confidence that the company will continue to increase mobile-advertising sales on its application and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>To some degree, the gain also reflects froth in tech stocks; the Nasdaq Internet index has almost doubled since Facebook went public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Its shares trade at 87 times earnings, almost five times the average in the S&P 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Companies in the Nasdaq Internet Index trade at a price-earnings ratio of 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"When you see stocks with these high multiples, it shows you the market's comfort in the longer-term growth story," said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Investors think Facebook is more valuable than the average Nasdaq stock."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The company's quick rise to $90.10 a share on Monday is even more remarkable because the stock lost more than half its value in the four months after its IPO in May 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Facebook had a market value of $104.2 billion at its IPO, so the company didn't have to climb as far as some other companies did to reach $250 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With a market value of $253 billion, Facebook is now the ninth-biggest company in the S&P 500 - bigger than Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co., which took decades to grow as valuable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Facebook's revenue from advertising - from which the company gets more than 90 percent of its sales - increased 46 percent to $3.32 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>More than two-thirds of that came from mobile ad sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Analysts estimate that sales rose 37 in the second quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Longer-term, the company plans to serve ads on other applications and websites and to make money from its rapidly growing Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Facebook also is betting on its $2 billion purchase last year of Oculus VR Inc., a virtual-reality headset maker, and efforts to expand Internet connections in developing countries.</td></tr>
