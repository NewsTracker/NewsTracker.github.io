<h3>Greece on Edge as Banks Run Low on Cash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The European Central Bank has announced it is maintaining emergency credit to Greek banks at its current level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The decision keeps a key financial lifeline open but does not provide further credit to Greece's banks, which are seeing deposits drain away as anxious Greeks withdraw savings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The ECB said it was working closely with the Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability and added it could reconsider the decision on credit levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>ECB head Mario Draghi said "we continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece and we strongly endorse the commitment of Member States in pledging to take action to address the fragilities of euro-area economies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Worried Greeks were lining up at ATM machines on Sunday, the day after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum on creditors' financial proposals in return for rescue loans and creditors refused to extend Greece's international bailout beyond Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While some machines in Greece were running out of cash, others were being replenished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Another top Greek financial official urged Greeks on Sunday to remain calm and not withdraw all their savings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The news came as France's prime minister urged Greece and other nations to do whatever they can to keep Greece in the 19-nation bloc that uses the euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Sunday that "we don't know - none of us - the consequences of an exit from the eurozone, either on the political or economic front. We must do everything so that Greece stays in the eurozone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was speaking on France's i-Tele TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Valls added that "means respecting Greece and democracy, but it's also about respecting European rules. So Greece needs to come back to the negotiating table."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tsipras' call for a national referendum on creditors' demands has thrown Greece's negotiations with its international lenders into turmoil.</td></tr>
