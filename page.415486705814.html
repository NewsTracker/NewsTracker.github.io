<h3>Robert Durst, from documentary 'The Jinx', arrested on murder charge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>New York: Robert Durst, the scion of a New York real estate family, has been arraigned in New Orleans after being arrested on first-degree murder charges in a killing 15 years ago in Los Angeles, law enforcement officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For years, questions have swirled around Mr Durst about the unsolved killing of a close friend in Los Angeles in 2000, about his first wife's disappearance in 1982, and about the shooting and dismemberment of a Texas neighbour in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Durst is the subject of an HBO documentary series examining the unsolved killings of the friend, Susan Berman, and the ex-wife, Kathleen Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The sixth and final episode of the documentary, The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst was scheduled to air in the United States on Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The series is due to air in Australia on Showcase on May 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An undated handout photo of Robert Durst after his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Durst's lawyer, Chip Lewis, said that the arrest of his client on Saturday, in the lobby of the JW Marriott Hotel in New Orleans, was on murder charges in the death of Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Los Angeles district attorney recently reopened an investigation into Berman's death, and is tying it to the case of Mr Durst's missing wife in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Durst went on trial in 2001 for the murder of the Texas neighbour, Morris Black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A jury found him not guilty, though Mr Durst admitted having dismembered Black's body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The case of Berman's death was reopened after the producers of the documentary contacted the Los Angeles district attorney more than a year ago to discuss new evidence they had turned up in the course of working on their series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A flier from the investigation of the 1982 disappearance of Kathleen Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In episode five of the series, Mr Berman's stepson, Sareb Kaufman, was shown giving the producers a 1999 note from Mr Durst to Berman, in which the lettering was similar to an anonymous note sent to the Beverly Hills Police Department alerting them to a "cadaver" at Berman's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Berman was found dead in December 2000 at her home in Benedict Canyon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Investigators said that she had been shot execution-style and that there were no signs of a forced entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Durst, in an interview last week after episode five aired in the US, said he felt increasingly bitter toward the producers - Marc Smerling and Andrew Jarecki - and Mr Kaufman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Durst said that he did not have the "faintest idea" who killed Berman, nor did he know what happened to his first wife, who has been declared legally dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Speaking in a gravelly monotone, he did say that he felt "complicit" in the disintegration of their marriage and the violent episodes that accompanied it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On Sunday morning, in an appearance at the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, Mr Durst was arraigned on a charge of first-degree murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He appeared in a nearly empty courtroom wearing an orange jumpsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He was accompanied by two lawyers; four FBI agents were also present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Judge Juana Lombard ordered him held without bond and an extradition hearing was scheduled for Monday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mr Lewis said earlier on Sunday that Mr Durst would waive extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We're waiving extradition so that we can get back to Los Angeles so that we can get back and fight the charges," Mr Lewis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The details of the warrant were not released on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the warrant was issued by the Los Angeles Police Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Officials from that police agency did not return calls or emails seeking comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Joseph Becerra, the New York State Police investigator who reopened Kathleen Durst's case in 2000, said his office and the Westchester County district attorney's office were monitoring the developments in the Berman case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We'll proceed from there," he said, adding, "ours is a separate investigation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mr Durst, 71, was arrested on Saturday by FBI agents and state police officers as he walked into the lobby of the JW Marriott Hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He was booked into the Orleans Parish jail just before 11pm, according to an online record of his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Craig Betbeze, a spokesman for the FBI in New Orleans, confirmed the arrest, but would not comment further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>John Lewin, the lead prosecutor in Mr Durst's case, declined to comment on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Mr Lewin, who was not involved in the earlier investigation, has made a reputation for getting convictions in cold cases, some of them decades old and whose victims' bodies were never found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Mr Durst's brother Douglas, the chairman of the Durst Organization, said on Sunday that the family was "relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done."</td></tr>
