<tr><td>53</td><td>After months of acrimony, Greece finally clinched a bailout agreement with its European creditors on Monday that will secure the country's place in the euro and avoid financial collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>The terms, however, will be painful for Greeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Before it can get 85 billion euros ($95.1 billion) in bailout cash and support for its banks to reopen, the Greek government will have to pass a raft of austerity measures that include sales tax increases and pension and labor reforms.</td></tr>

<tr><td>65</td><td>Sigmar Gabriel says Germany and France, the eurozone's two biggest economic powers, played a big role in making it possible for Greece to stay in the eurozone.</td></tr>

<tr><td>67</td><td>He said "without these hard conditions it would not have been responsible to launch such a large financial aid package."</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Greeks seem to be taking the agreement their government reached with its creditors and its accompanying harsh measures in stride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Many say they understand more pain is on the way but that it is far better than an alternative that would have pushed Greece out of the shared euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Periklis Stinios, a 38-year-old lawyer walking through Athens' Syntagma Squre, described the deal as "a historic opportunity ... for the young generation. Because the previous ones didn't manage to rise to the occasion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Panagiotis Toutsidis, a retiree, says the Greek people got what they were expecting, which was a deal.</td></tr>

<tr><td>75</td><td>He says "some difficult steps" remain, particularly by Greece, which has to work on re-establishing credibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Still, he says the agreement reflects Europe's readiness to reach political compromises, "a characteristic that formed a peaceful and prosperous union from a fragmented continent after World War II."</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Steinmeier spoke on the sidelines of the Iran nuclear talks in Vienna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>French President Francois Hollande has hailed the agreement reached by eurozone leaders on Greece after marathon talks as a good deal for Greece and its European partners and creditors.</td></tr>

<tr><td>106</td><td>French President Francois Hollande says the Greek parliament should convene within hours to adopt new reforms, and has praised the fact that the deal should keep Greece in the euro.</td></tr>
