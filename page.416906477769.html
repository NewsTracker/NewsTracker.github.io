<h3>Markets fall as hopes low for Greece bailout deal at meeting</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) " Greece's finance minister says the country and its creditors have a "moral and political responsibility" to swiftly conclude much-delayed bailout talks, but Athens will not budge from its key negotiating positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Stock markets fell in the eurozone and Greece as expectations were low for a breakthrough on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yanis Varoufakis will meet later in the day with his eurozone peers, which provide the bulk of the loans keeping Greece afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Despite three months of talks, Greece and its creditors have failed to agree on further reforms and savings Athens needs to qualify for a 7.2 billion euro ($8 billion) loan installment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Without the cash, Greece could go bankrupt within weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Varoufakis says Greece's left-led government will reject any deal that doesn't guarantee a credible prospect of ending Greece's crisis.</td></tr>
