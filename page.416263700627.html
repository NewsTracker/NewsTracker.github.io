<h3>European vacations about 25% cheaper because of drop in euro's value</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Vacations in Europe have a new attraction: The euro's steep drop in value is making the continent much cheaper for tourists from across the world, especially the United States and China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For American tourists, the dollar's strength translates into a discount of around 25% compared with this time last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>China's currency has risen some 20% against the euro over the last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And Eurozone residents feeling the pinch from their sluggish economies are more likely to stay inside the bloc, where they won't feel the currency changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That means the ingredients are in place for "a great year for tourism" in Europe, said Nick Greenfield, head of tour operator relations at the European Tour Operators Assn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The euro has fallen against many currencies in recent times, but its drop has been particularly pronounced against the dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The euro was trading at $1.057 on Wednesday, having been as high as $1.40 a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tim Cooper, a global economist at BMI Research in London, said his company expects the euro and dollar to reach parity this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The European Central Bank's policies have been weakening the euro, while those of the U.S. Federal Reserve have been bolstering the dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The euro has also been dragged down by fears over Greece's debts and the bloc's muted economic growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>U.S. bookings to some European countries have risen as much as 20% so far, European tourism officials and American travel companies report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lyssandros Tsilidis, president of the Hellenic Assn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>of Travel and Tourist Agents, said Greece has seen a 15% to 20% increase in reservations from the U.S. - Europe's biggest long-haul market - compared with the same time last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Spain saw a 12% increase in January and almost 19% in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Officials anticipate more growth, which they attribute to the dollar's strength.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The exchange rate "certainly makes things easier to enjoy," said Bob Homeyer, a retired businessman from San Diego on vacation in Madrid with his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We have had some fine meals for what worked out to be reasonable prices, and our visit to the Prado Museum worked out at 7 euros ($7.48) each, which is a real bargain," he said outside the Madrid landmark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Among individual cities, Paris is a top attraction, pulling some 10 million Americans tourists last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Officials hope to make it 11 million this year - and "encourage them to spend more" while the exchange rate is favorable, said Francois Navarro, general manager of the city's tourism committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>If trends hold, Navarro said, Americans could well return this year to the top spot among foreign tourists in the Paris area for the first time in about a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It'll be a big deal," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But a new generation of Chinese tourists is shaking up Paris' forecasts, Navarro said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They're aged 25 to 40, travel alone and spend on high-end hotels and restaurants, unlike the previous generation that wanted mainly to shop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And a Chinese visitor spends four times as much on average as an American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The U.S. is also the biggest source of tourists for Rome, which recorded a 7% increase in American visitors in January, the latest figures available, compared with the same month last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>U.S. tour company Liberty Travel said its New York City outlets are reporting a year-on-year 17% jump in bookings to Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That includes marked growth in travel to usually less-visited European cities, including Dublin, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid and Athens, the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Vacationers have a broad variety of options to choose from: The Eurozone encompasses countries from Portugal to Finland and from Greece to Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Europe is now competing for American business with popular U.S. destinations, said Joseph A. Moscone, Booking.com's senior manager for public relations in the Americas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The company compared room prices this year in Paris, Rome, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Berlin with last year's prices, using the euro-dollar exchange rate last month and in March 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It concluded that the average price in U.S. dollars for a night in a four-star hotel in those cities is down 21%, and down 17% for five-star accommodation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That means, Booking.com calculates, that for the price of seven days in Palm Springs, an American could spend 14 days in Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Vacations in Europe are "not only affordable, but even a relatively inexpensive option in comparison to some pricier U.S. destinations," Moscone said.</td></tr>
