<tr><td>8</td><td>He said Emwazi "caressed" his neck with a long blade and described how he would behead Espinosa: "'Feel it? Cold, isn't it? Can you imagine the pain you'll feel when it cuts? Unimaginable pain,'" he quoted Emwazi as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Emwazi went on to describe precisely how the beheading would occur, the former hostage said, and explained where he would place Espinosa's head once it had been done.</td></tr>
