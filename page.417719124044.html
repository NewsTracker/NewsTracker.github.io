<h3>Threat of Greek default sends markets tumbling</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Stock markets in Europe and North America are taking a hit from the IMF's decision to walk away from bailout talks with Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Athens stock exchange took the steepest plunge, down 5.9 per cent Friday as investors began to doubt Greece would come to an agreement with its creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Stocks in the National Bank of Greece fell by more than 10 per cent, while Piraeus Bank fell more than 11.5 per cent as investors mulled how a Greek default would weigh on its banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Stocks in London, Germany and throughout Europe fell, with the Euro Stox index down more than 1.4 per cent in the wake of fresh doubt about a Greek deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Then North American markets followed, with the TSX index down 92 points to 14,738 and New York's Dow down 140 points to 17,898 at the close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A slip in the price of oil, with West Texas Intermediate falling to $59.98 US a barrel helped drag down Toronto energy stocks but Greece hung over the markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The International Monetary Fund announced Thursday it would send its negotiators home from bailout talks with Greek officials in Brussels, saying Greece was unrealistic in its demands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We remain engaged, but the ball is very much in Greece's court right now," said spokesman Gerry Rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has been trying to convince EU and IMF lenders to relax conditions on releasing the last 7.2 billion euros ($9.9 billion Cdn) left in Greece's bailout fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Among the contentious issues are cuts to Greek pensions, civil service jobs and the size of the government budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greece has already pulled in cash from government agencies and local municipalities to solve its immediate cash flow problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And it has postponed three debt payments to the IMF to the end of the month in an effort to buy time in the bailout talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Greece has a 1.6 billion-euro ($2.2 billion) IMF debt installment due June 30 and larger debts due to the European Central Bank in July and August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Markets had been optimistic about ongoing talks with Tsipras still at the table on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But he has headed home after the break with the IMF and will have to negotiate further concessions with his fractious supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We are coming to a head," said David Mackie of JP Morgan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Our judgment remains that Greece will offer concessions to get a deal. The Greek position deteriorates dramatically beyond the end of June, as capital controls would likely make the political and economic situation in Greece even more difficult than it is now."</td></tr>
