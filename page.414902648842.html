<h3>2 sides in West Coast seaport dispute race against deadline</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The breakthrough came after nine months of talks that turned contentious in the fall, when dockworkers and their employers began blaming each other for problems getting imports to consumers and exports overseas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The five-year deal still must be approved by the 13,000-member International Longshore and Warehouse Union's rank-and-file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They work 29 ports from San Diego to Seattle that handle about one-quarter of all U.S. international trade, much of it with Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, who this week began overseeing talks in San Francisco - where both the union and maritime association of employers are based - said that both the dockworkers' union and their employers agreed to resume work Saturday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As the two sides quarreled, employers cut most weekend work, saying they would not pay extra wages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With ships and their cargo weeks behind schedule, "I suspect that people will be getting a lot of overtime in the days ahead," Perez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dozens of ships laden with a you-name-it range of imported goods are using waters off the ports as parking lots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It will take weeks - and probably months - to unblock that traffic jam, as well as the gridlock of containers already on the docks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Applauding the resolution, President Barack Obama urged "the parties to work together to clear out the backlogs," the White House said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Chief negotiators for each side called the deal "good for workers and for the industry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are also pleased that our ports can now resume full operations," union President Bob McEllrath and James McKenna, president of the Pacific Maritime Association, said in a joint written statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A vote by union members could come in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The full maritime association must approve the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Neither side released details, but in a recent letter to maritime association members, McKenna outlined what he called employers' "last, best and final" offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It included maintenance of nearly no-cost health coverage, an $11,000 increase in the maximum pension benefit to $91,000, and a $1-per-hour wage increase over each of the five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Though dockworker wages vary by job and skill level, the average exceeds $50 per hour, according to the maritime association, which represents ocean-going shipping lines and the companies that load and unload cargo at port terminals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Negotiators began talking formally in May. Their prior six-year contract expired July 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>After initial signs of progress, in the fall employers publicly charged dockworkers with creating a congestion crisis to gain bargaining leverage by slowing their work rate and withholding the most skilled workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The union responded that its members were working safely and blamed the jam on broader dysfunction at West Coast ports that predated contract talks, notably a lack of truck beds to tow containers from dockside yards to distribution warehouses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>By January, the maritime association's members stopped ordering night work crews to load and unload ships, saying that smaller groups would focus on clearing the thicket of containers already on the docks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Union members called it an attempt to hurt workers in their pocketbooks; their negotiators soon agreed to the involvement of a federal mediator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The slowdown-vs.-lockout dynamic was the kind of brinksmanship familiar from past negotiations between two sides with a history of conflict that dates to the killing of dockworkers during the Great Depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>How much responsibility for the congestion each side bears may never be determined but their animosity magnified the crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In early February, the CEO of the maritime association publicly warned that if no agreement could be reached, employers would stop calling workers and shut down the ports within days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Weekend and holiday lockouts of many longshoremen followed, though major ports were not fully closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Instead, cargo trickled through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Massive ocean-going ships anchored off the coast of Los Angeles and near the ports of Oakland and Seattle, waiting for berths they anticipated occupying after the long haul across the Pacific that instead were taken by ships whose unloading was itself far behind schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>By mid-February, about 30 ships clustered outside the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors, with similar scenes in San Francisco Bay and Washington's Puget Sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The scenes were reminiscent of a 2002 worker lockout that shuttered West Coast ports for 10 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Though negotiations between the two sides typically involve public theatrics, U.S. businesses grew increasingly antsy as talks ground on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Groups representing retailers warned that some holiday goods might be delayed; thanks to advanced planning, however, trouble on the waterfront didn't steal Christmas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Still, there were broader economic repercussions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Farm exports suffered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>McDonald's in Japan, for example, began rationing fries because of a potato shortage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Apple, nut and hay producers all said they were losing out to foreign competitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The meat industry tallied its losses in the tens of millions of dollars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Importers of furniture, books, clothing - even Mardi Gras beads - said their products were stuck on the docks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Honda Motor Co. cut production because of a parts shortage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. warned that Easter goodies could be affected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>After a federal mediator couldn't broker an agreement, the Obama administration dispatched Labor Secretary Perez to oversee talks this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He warned negotiators that if they didn't seal a deal by midnight Friday, he'd haul them back to Washington, where a parade of elected leaders had been imploring resolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>With so much at stake, outsiders puzzled over why the talks took so long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>A summer deal on health care benefits seemed to portend quick progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>But negotiations stalled on issues that included what future jobs would fall under the control of the union, which worries that automation at the ports will erode its membership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>In the end, the disagreement boiled down to the system for resolving allegations of work slowdowns, discrimination and other conflicts at the ports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The union wanted to get rid of the man who arbitrates disputes in Southern California and proposed changes that would accomplish that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The maritime association rejected those suggestions - though eventually the two sides found a compromise that Perez said would require arbitrators to reapply for their positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The unpredictability that preceded Friday's agreement could have long-term implications for West Coast ports and their reputation for reliability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>With the widening of the Panama Canal and with ports on the East Coast and Gulf Coast investing to attract more ships, some retailers have said they will think hard before depending on ports such as Los Angeles and Long Beach for the smooth flow of cargo.</td></tr>

<h3>European jihadis unable to join Islamic State, locked at home</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Fighters in Syria and Iraq contacted by Reuters said the impact was limited on the battlefield since European fighters make up only a fraction of the forces of Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Now most of the (foreign) fighters are coming from Asian countries, like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. They are tough fighters," an Islamic State militant who fought with the group in both Syria and Iraq, told Reuters via the internet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some also said that restrictions might backfire on European countries when jihadis who are prevented from traveling to the Middle East are encouraged to wage individual attacks at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>European countries are working hard to reduce recruitment by the group, sometimes referred to by the acronyms ISIS or ISIL, which has seized wide swathes of Iraq and Syria and is now the target of a U.S.-led campaign of air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The group takes pride in having attracted fighters from across the globe, including thousands from Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Western countries fear that some European fighters could return home and carry out attacks in their native countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The presence of European fighters drew particular attention in the West last year when a man with a British accent appeared in videos of British and American prisoners being beheaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>European countries have arrested people for recruiting for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Several have passed laws allowing travel documents to be seized from those who travel to fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One Syrian supporter of the group said such measures were a sign that its importance was being recognized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"At first these countries took us lightly, they thought the fighters will come here and die. But what they did not see coming was that they get trained and also started to contact their friends and relatives to join," said the Syrian supporter who lives in an Islamic State-held territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Islamic State is now stretched, waging battles on several fronts in both Iraq and Syria while trying to administer areas under its control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fighters proclaiming loyalty to the group also have emerged in several countries including Libya and Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Several members said the group fields 60,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria, mostly local Sunni Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>About 550 German citizens have joined fighting in Syria and about 180 are believed to have returned, German officials have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Germany plans to seize personal identity cards of would-be jihadis for up to three years according to a draft law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>France has cracked down since mid-2014, ramping up a campaign after new anti-terrorism laws were passed by parliament late last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>French officials estimate that about 400 French citizens are in Syria, 180 have returned to France, 200 want to go and 200 are somewhere in Europe trying to get there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>British officials think some 600 people have gone to fight, with 300 now returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Police can now seize the passports of nationals trying to leave the country for up to 30 days, and can temporarily prevent citizens suspected of involvement with Islamic State from re-entering Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This important legislation will disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight and then return," Home Secretary Theresa May said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Despite the crackdown, the group continues to receive fresh fighters through neighboring countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Several jihadi sources said that traveling through Turkey remains the main route.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Turkey has responded to strong criticism from Western allies alarmed at the flow of fighters into Syria by ramping up border controls, officials and diplomats have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>This month the Turkish army said at least 19 people intent on joining Islamic State had been detained close to the frontier, including 13 foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The impression we have is that Turkey has tightened things up," one western diplomat told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Anti-Islamic State activists inside Syria say there has been tension among the group with some members, mainly foreigners, fleeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Fighters deny this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"The (foreigners) are not leaving the State. In two months in Baiji we received 180. In one of the training camps here forty percent of the fighters are foreigners," said a fighter who is now based in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Baiji, site of Iraq's biggest oil refinery, has been one of the main battlefields between fighters and Iraqi government forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The group has had its eyes on Europe since it first appeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In many of its videos, fighters declare that one of its targets is "Rome", by which they mean Christian Europe generally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It is now encouraging what it calls "lone wolves" to carry out attacks inside Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"If they cannot come here they still fight these infidels inside the countries they live in," a fighter who gave his name as Bakr said.</td></tr>
