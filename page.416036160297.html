<h3>Price falls 1 out short of shutout, Tigers beat Twins 4-0 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Price retired the first 13 Minnesota batters and allowed five hits before being pulled with two on and two out in the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Joe Nathan struck out Torii Hunter for the save, although Hunter argued to plate umpire Joe West that he checked his swing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Twins lost in their first game under new manager Paul Molitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>J.D. Martinez and Alex Avila homered off Phil Hughes, and Yoenis Cespedes tripled and scored in his Detroit debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cespedes also reached above the wall in left to catch Kurt Suzuki's drive in the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Tigers acquired Price at last year's trade deadline, and manager Brad Ausmus picked him to start opening day, snapping Justin Verlander's seven-year streak of openers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Price has started the last three games played at Comerica Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He beat the Twins on the final day of the regular season last year, enabling the Tigers to hold off Kansas City and win the AL Central for a fourth straight year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Then Price was on the mound for Game 3 of the AL Division Series against Baltimore, when the Orioles ended Detroit's season with an impressive sweep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The left-hander is crucial to the Tigers' hopes of holding onto the division, especially after Max Scherzer left via free agency and signed with Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Detroit could also use a bounce-back from Verlander, who struggled in 2014 and has been dealing with tightness in his right triceps lately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Verlander was passed over for the opening day start, and he's now on the disabled list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Price did not allow a baserunner Monday until Kennys Vargas singled in the fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Martinez opened the scoring with a solo homer in the second, and Avila's two-run shot later in the inning made it 3-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Price struck out five without a walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hughes allowed four runs and eight hits in six innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He struck out six and walked one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ausmus was booed when he went to the mound to check on Price with a runner on and two outs in the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He left his left-hander in, but an infield single by Joe Mauer was enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Hunter, who spent the last two seasons with the Tigers, got a nice ovation before the game, but he wasn't happy at all with the call that ended the game, arguing with West as the umpire left the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Twins: Minnesota avoided any significant injury problems heading into the season, although CF Jordan Schafer crashed into the wall while trying to catch Cespedes' triple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He was fine and stayed in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tigers: Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez both made it back for opening day after offseason surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Cabrera had an ankle operation, and Martinez injured a knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They missed a chunk of the exhibition season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Cabrera was hitless Monday, while Martinez contributed an eighth-inning single.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>After an off-day Tuesday, Detroit RHP Anibal Sanchez faces Minnesota RHP Ricky Nolasco on Wednesday.</td></tr>
