<h3>Greece casts shadow as ECB money printing buoys euro zone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers gathering on Wednesday will examine possible further emergency funding for Greece's banks as they take stock of a wider economic picture showing early signs of improvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With falling prices in the euro zone beginning to stabilize, ECB President Mario Draghi will be able to claim an early success for the quantitative easing scheme -- money printing to buy chiefly government bonds -- launched by the bank in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The ECB's borrowing rates are all but certain to be held at record lows, but continued wrangling between Greece and the euro zone over reforms and aid is casting a cloud of uncertainty over the 19-country currency bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Athens has until the middle of this week to improve a package of reforms required for the release of euro zone loans that it needs to stay afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Were Greece ultimately to tumble out of the euro, it would deal a blow to the credibility of the currency union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Athens was first bailed out almost five years ago by the euro zone with another aid deal in 2012 but its future remains uncertain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The euro crisis is not over. But the currency union is in a sweet spot, with a lower euro and oil prices helping the economy," said UBS economist Martin Lueck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"QE can help to repair the euro zone economy but it is too early yet to judge its chances."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Draghi is likely to address the euro zone's improving prospects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The ECB's actions are creating fertile conditions for growth, with the euro at a 12-year low buoying exporters and borrowing in many countries cheaper than ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some investors hope he will also show there is room for flexibility in rolling out money printing to ensure the 60 billion euro ($63.29 billion) a month program stays on track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>With recent data pointing to a economic turnaround, some financial market traders are already asking when and how the ECB might start scaling down its stimulus, although that is still a long way off for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The ECB can be quite happy about recent developments," Commerzbank economist Joerg Kraemer said, pointing to improving lending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But they will not want to rule out further steps, such as that the (QE) program goes beyond September 2016."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Draghi will hold a press conference on Wednesday before he travels to Washington to join finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 top economies at the International Monetary Fund's Spring meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He may reveal whether the ECB's decision-making Governing Council extended the limit on emergency liquidity that can be drawn by Greek banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This has been steadily rising in recent weeks as savers, worried about the country's prospects, have withdrawn deposits.</td></tr>
