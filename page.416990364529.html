<tr><td>9</td><td>Two American flag "Welcome Home" magnets are on the fridge door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ron said he last heard from Chris on Mother's Day, when Chris sent flowers home to his mom, Theresa, while he was in Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I told him I was very proud of him, that he's over in Nepal helping people out and that he still remembered Mother's Day," Ron said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He said he was glad to hear I was doing so well. He texted me back and thanked me for the compliment, and that was about it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ron said Marine Corps representatives came to his house Tuesday night in northwest Wichita to tell the family Chris was missing.</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>Ron said he couldn't wait on his wife for the news because he was thinking the worst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said Marine Corps officials visited him again on Wednesday but didn't have any updates - just that Chris was still missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But one silver lining for Ron is that rescuers haven't reported any smoke, fire or emergency sirens in the search area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I know my son," Ron said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"He's a very determined individual, and I really truly believe he'll come out of it OK."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Marine helicopter was last seen after another helicopter in the area "picked up some (radio) chatter about a fuel problem," Army Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, told the Marine Corps Times.</td></tr>

<tr><td>28</td><td>Schuckman said he visited Ron and Theresa on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"When I talked to the family and they told me Chris was the pilot of the plane, there was a sense of calmness that came across my body," Schuckman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"If he was in charge, it will be all right. I just have that much confidence in that guy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Schuckman said he last talked with Chris before he left for Japan in the fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Kollen Long, adviser of the school newspaper and journalism teacher at Bishop Carroll, said he's obsessed over the news coverage about Chris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I guess he's in his 30s now, but to me, he's still a high school kid who sat at the front table of the newspaper class," Long said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I know he's a big tough Marine now, but I just envision him as a young high school kid."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Long said Chris was one of the best photojournalists he's taught and worked to recruit him for the student newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Long said Chris would always have a stack of books next to him in the dark room while he waited for his film to develop, because he didn't want to waste any time.</td></tr>

<tr><td>41</td><td>Chris got laid off from Cessna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Ron said Chris had a private pilot's license and always wanted to fly, so he signed up for the Marine Corps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Ron said the Marine Corps guaranteed Chris that he could be a pilot, even though most must enlist before being placed in that position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Chris trained for the Marines in Virginia and then led a group of about 40 reservists in Afghanistan for roughly eight months, because flight schools were full at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>After returning to the states, he went to flight school in Florida, first flying fixed-wing aircraft and then switching to helicopters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Ron said he then transferred to California for the rest of his training to become a captain.</td></tr>
