<h3>Cowboys agree to deal with pass rusher Greg Hardy (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Now they wait to see how soon the former Carolina player will boost their mediocre pass rush.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With Hardy facing a league suspension for violating the NFL's domestic conduct policy, the team signed him Wednesday to a one-year deal valued at up to $13.1 million if he meets incentives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A person with knowledge of the contract provided details on condition of anonymity because terms were not announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hardy played just one game last season because he was placed on the commissioner's exempt list after a judge in North Carolina convicted him on domestic violence charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The case was thrown out on appeal when Hardy's accuser couldn't be located to testify, and the NFL filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking evidence from the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the contract was ''heavily weighted toward his participation in games'' after the team spent weeks researching Hardy's background.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''Obviously a great deal of our study was dedicated to the issue of domestic violence, and the recent events that associated Greg with that issue,'' Jones said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''Our organization understands the very serious nature of domestic violence in our society and in our league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The league is seeking evidence from Hardy's case through North Carolina's open records laws after prosecutors refused to release anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His ex-girlfriend testified that Hardy threw her in a bathroom and onto a futon filled with guns and threatened to kill her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hardy denied the allegations in his testimony, and prosecutors say he reached a civil suit agreement with the accuser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Without evidence from the trial, it could be difficult for the NFL to enforce a tougher personal-conduct policy approved by owners after Hardy's conviction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>First-time violations involving assault, sexual assault and domestic violence can result in six-game suspensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Previously, first-time offenders typically received two-game bans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The 26-year-old Hardy tied a Carolina club record with 15 sacks in 2013, and made $13.1 million on the franchise tag last season despite playing just one game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''We have spent a great deal of time over the last two days in meeting with Greg directly and gaining a solid understanding of what he is all about as a person and as a football player,'' Jones said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The 6-foot-4, 275-pound Hardy, a sixth-round pick by the Panthers in 2010, had 26 sacks over two seasons before his legal troubles arose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He had 194 tackles and 33 sacks in his first four seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Cowboys were 28th in the NFL in sacks with 28 last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Jeremy Mincey, a low-cost defensive end added in free agency last year, led Dallas with six sacks and is returning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tackle Henry Melton, who had five sacks despite battling injuries, signed with Tampa Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Dallas moved up in the second round of the 2014 draft to grab DeMarcus Lawrence after cutting franchise sacks leader DeMarcus Ware in a salary cap move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Lawrence missed the first half of the season after breaking his foot in training camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''This agreement involved an important element of our defensive scheme, specifically the pass rush, at a position that we felt we needed to address this offseason,'' Jones said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It's the second time in four years the Cowboys made a big move for their defense in free agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>They added cornerback Brandon Carr on a $50 million deal in 2012, and could release him if he doesn't accept a pay cut after going without an interception for the first time in his seven-year career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Cowboys also hope to re-sign linebacker Rolando McClain, a former top 10 pick by Oakland who returned after a year away from the game to have a solid first season in Dallas.</td></tr>
