<h3>Egypt sentences 3 to year in prison over racy video</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Egyptian court has sentenced three people involved in a racy music video to one year in prison with labor for "inciting debauchery."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The music video, titled "Hands Off," contains scantily-clad dancing and shaking but no nudity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Reda al-Fouly, the woman dancing in the low-budget video, was arrested last month along with the clip's cameraman after it went viral on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Wael el-Sekedi, the third person sentenced in the case, is believed to have fled the country after some social media users called the video scandalous, according to the prosecutor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The three were sentenced on Sunday.</td></tr>
