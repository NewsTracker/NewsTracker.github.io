<tr><td>20</td><td>"I think the evidence here is a lot more troublesome for the prosecution," DeGuerin pointed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Not only is it a circumstantial evidence case, but it's a weak circumstantial evidence case. And it's based primarily on two things: this junk science letter and the bathroom confession. Throw me in that briar patch."</td></tr>
