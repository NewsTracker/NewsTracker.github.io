<tr><td>11</td><td>Lester's winless streak reached 10 starts.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>The 11th error for the rookie third baseman put runners on second and third with no outs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Alexei Ramirez then singled in a run and Tyler Flowers had a two-run double for a 5-0 lead, more than enough support for Sale.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>Sale struck out 10 after his record-tying streak of eight consecutive starts with at least 10 Ks ended against Toronto on Monday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>The lefty was charged with four earned runs and seven hits in seven innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He struck out eight without a walk but got little support from a team that nearly got shut out for the second game in a row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''We've seen good pitching,'' manager Joe Maddon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''That's it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>We are a swing-and-miss team.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>As for Lester?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''He was outstanding,'' Maddon said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>Lester retired 14 in a row before Melky Cabrera singled leading off the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Bryant then overthrew first after fielding Garcia's grounder, and the White Sox tacked on three more runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Cubs scored with one out in the bottom half on an RBI double by Jonathan Herrera, batting for Lester.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Before that hit, White Sox pitchers went 30 1/3 innings without allowing a run.</td></tr>
