<h3>Volcano erupts in Galapagos Islands, home to unique pink iguanas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>QUITO, May 25 (Reuters) - A volcano perched atop one of Ecuador's Galapagos Islands erupted in the early hours of Monday, the local authorities said, potentially threatening a unique species of pink iguanas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The roughly 1.7-kilometer (1.1-mile) high Wolf volcano is located on Isabela Island, home to a rich variety of flora and fauna typical of the archipelago that helped inspire Charles Darwin's theory of evolution following his 1835 visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The Wolf volcano is not located near a populated area. There is not risk for the human population. This is the only population of pink iguanas in the world," Galapagos National Park said in a posting on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The park posted pictures showing lava pouring down the sides of the Wolf volcano, the Galapagos' highest point, while a dark plume estimated to be 10 km (6.4 miles) high, billowed overhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wolf had been inactive 33 years, according to the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The lava is flowing down the volcano's southern face while the iguanas, officially an endangered species, inhabit the opposite side, the Environment Ministry said in a statement, adding it expected the animals to escape harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The flow is likely to reach the sea, however, where it could harm marine life, the Geophysics Institute said separately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While populated areas of the island are safe from the eruption, the institute said some of the ash cloud could descend upon them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In April, unusual seismic activity was also reported at the Sierra volcano on the same Isabela Island, the archipelago's biggest, where yellow iguanas and giant turtles also live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The eruption in Ecuador comes on the heels of eruptions in Chile, another South American country located on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire.</td></tr>
