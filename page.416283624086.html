<h3>Evolving estimates of Taylor Energy's 11 year Gulf oil leak</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For more than a decade, oil has been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico at the site where a hurricane-triggered mudslide toppled a drilling platform off the coast of Louisiana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Associated Press investigation has uncovered evidence that the slow-motion spill is far worse than platform owner Taylor Energy Company has publicly reported during its secretive - and costly - government-managed effort to end the leak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Confronted with an AP analysis that found a recent spike in reported sheen sizes and volumes, the Coast Guard acknowledged it held a workshop last August to improve the methodology employed by a Taylor contractor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Coast Guard also provided a new leak estimate - based on a new method for estimating sheen sizes - that is at least 20 times greater than one recently touted by Taylor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>- September 2004: A wave-induced mudslide during Hurricane Ivan topples a Taylor Energy Company-owned drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico, burying a cluster of 28 wells under mounds of unstable sediment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>- July 2008: The Coast Guard determines that oil leaking at the site of the toppled platform poses a "significant threat" to the environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The government orders Taylor Energy to perform additional work, including daily monitoring flights over the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>- October 2008: Based on slick sightings, the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service estimates an average of 22 gallons of oil per day is spilling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>- March 2013: Federal officials estimate the site has been discharging approximately 4,500 gallons per year - or around 12 gallons per day - since flights over the site began in July 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This estimate is based on reports submitted to the Coast Guard by a Taylor Energy contractor flying over the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>- March 2014: The Coast Guard and Interior Department convene a scientific workshop to review leak assessments by Taylor Energy-contracted experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a recent court filing, the company says experts assembled for the workshop concluded that the sheens observed at the site contained an average volume of less than 4 gallons per day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>- August 2014: The federal government hosts another workshop with Taylor contractors, this time to review the methodology for estimating slick size and volumes during the monitoring flights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Starting Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>1, the contractor's reports employ a new method that provides "a more consistent estimate of sheen estimations," according to a Coast Guard statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>- April 2015: Confronted with an Associated Press analysis of pollution reports that shows a recent spike in sheen sizes and volume, the Coast Guard releases a new leak estimate based on pollution reports submitted after the August 2014 workshop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Coast Guard says sheens containing an average of roughly 84 gallons per day have been spotted at the site since September 2014 for a total volume of approximately 16,000 gallons over the past seven months.</td></tr>
