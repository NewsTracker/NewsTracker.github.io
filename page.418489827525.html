<h3>Greece, Eurozone Leaders Reach Agreement On A New Bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The summit reached a tentative agreement with Greece for a bailout program that includes "serious reforms," removing an immediate threat that Greece could collapse financially and leave the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, front left, leaves after a meeting of eurozone heads of state Monday at the EU Council building in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a news conference early Monday morning, Eurozone leaders announced that they would give Greece another bailout - as long as the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras manages to implement a round of austerity measures in the coming days, says European Council President Donald Tusk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>By Wednesday, lawmakers in Athens will need to pass pension overhauls and sales-tax increases that voters overwhelmingly rejected in a recent referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As recently as Sunday the two sides were reported to be far apart on a bailout, which is reported to be for three years and nearly $60 billion, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The German finance minister even suggested booting Greece off the Euro for five years while it sold off assets and got its house in order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Those measures appear to be off the table for now.</td></tr>
