<h3>Belgium finds way to issue its own Waterloo euro coin</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt holds a commemorative coin marking the 200th anniversary of The Battle of Waterloo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>London: Perhaps befitting a battle that ended French hegemony in Europe, Paris, it seems, has been outflanked once again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After it objected to a decision in March by Belgium to introduce a new 2 coin to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, the Belgians retreated, scrapping 180,000 coins they had already minted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But victory for France is proving elusive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The coin bears the Lion's Mound and a diagram of the troops present in the battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This week, Belgium decided to circumvent French resistance by invoking a little-known European Union rule that allows countries to issue euro coins of their choice, provided they are in an irregular denomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That led to the unveiling of a 2.50 coin - a first in Belgium - and 70,000 of them have now been minted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The coins, which can only be spent inside Belgium, display a monument of a lion atop a cone-shaped hill on the site of France's humiliation, as well as lines indicating where troops were positioned when forces led by Britain and Prussia defeated Napoleon in the countryside near Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Johan Van Overtveldt, the Belgian finance minister, has insisted the new coins were not meant to provoke Gallic anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The goal is not to revive old quarrels in a modern Europe - and there are more important things to sort out," he was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"But there's been no battle in recent history as important as Waterloo, or indeed one that captures the imagination in the same way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Back in March, officials in Paris wrote a letter to the European authorities insisting that the Battle of Waterloo, which took place on June 18, 1815, and altered the shape of European history, had a deep and damaging resonance in the collective French consciousness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>France protested Belgium's plans for its original coin by saying that basking in France's defeat threatened to undermine European unity, troubled enough already.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The 2 coin, it said, could spur an "unfavourable reaction in France".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In Belgium, the victory embodied in the 2.50 coin is being lauded as if the tiny country had itself triumphed on the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nevertheless, the move has inspired no little annoyance in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>An article on the website of BFMTV, the French broadcaster, noted that 200 years later, the defeat of Napoleon was "still hard to swallow".</td></tr>
