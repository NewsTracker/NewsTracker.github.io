<h3>Dombrowski out as Tigers' president, GM; Al Avila takes over (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DETROIT (AP) -- The end of Dave Dombrowski's tenure in Detroit came suddenly and unexpectedly - like so many of the moves he made to build the Tigers into an American League powerhouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dombrowski is out after nearly 14 seasons as president and general manager of the Tigers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The four-time Central Division champions announced the move Tuesday, catching people at Comerica Park and beyond by surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dombrowski was fresh off making several big trades last week, and his exit set off rampant speculation about where he would next work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dombrowski was in the last season of his contract and overseeing a team stuck below .500, so there was already speculation about whether he'd be back in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But his abrupt exit - accompanied by a somewhat cryptic explanation from the team - was unusual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He is being replaced by Al Avila, who has served as his top assistant since 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Avila's son, Alex, catches for the Tigers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I've decided to release Dave from his contract in order to afford him the time to pursue other career opportunities,'' owner Mike Ilitch said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>About an hour after announcing Dombrowski's departure, the Tigers held a news conference at the ballpark, introducing Avila before Tuesday night's game against Kansas City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ilitch wasn't at the news conference and neither was Dombrowski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A message was left with Dombrowski seeking comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''The only conversation I had with Dave was basically when he left, we said our goodbyes, and obviously we're still great friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I don't know how or why Mr. Ilitch made the decision,'' Avila said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''Really that's a question more for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Avila said Ilitch hired him Saturday, a day after Dombrowski completed the last of his trade-deadline deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said he didn't know about the switch until Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''I would like to thank Dave Dombrowski for his 14 years of service,'' Ilitch said in his statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Detroit has won four consecutive division titles, a streak that seems almost certain to end this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Tigers lost Tuesday to fall 12 1/2 games behind the first-place Royals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Dombrowski's last major act at the helm in Detroit was to trade away some of the team's top players with an eye toward the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>David Price, Yoenis Cespedes and Joakim Soria were all dealt last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The 59-year-old Dombrowski was the GM for the Montreal Expos and Marlins before moving to Detroit, and is likely to draw interest from teams around the majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Dombrowski joined the Tigers as team president in November 2001, with Detroit coming off a 96-loss season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He became general manager the following April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He presided over Detroit's AL-record 119 losses in 2003, but he eventually built one of the most star-studded rosters in baseball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Tigers drafted Justin Verlander, traded for Miguel Cabrera and Max Scherzer and signed several key free agents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>At times, Dombrowski's Tigers came seemingly out of nowhere to make big moves, such as signing Prince Fielder in 2012 or trading for Price at last year's deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Detroit won the AL pennant in 2006 and 2012, but the Tigers are still without a World Series title since 1984.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''Obviously it's tough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>I've been with Dave since the beginning of my career,'' Verlander said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''He's done a fantastic job for this organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Avila takes over a team with an uncertain future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Last week's trades helped Detroit add some much-needed young pitching to its system, but the Tigers still have long-term, expensive contracts owed to Verlander, Cabrera and designated hitter Victor Martinez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Avila had worked with Dombrowski for more than 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''I think I'm uniquely qualified to take this job because of all the years I have spent with this organization,'' Avila said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Avila assured fans that the Tigers aren't going to simply play out the string over the last two months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>''This does not mean we have given up on this season,'' Avila said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''We were sellers at the deadline, but we still have a good enough nucleus to win this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The timing of the move puts Avila in the awkward position of taking over a roster that was just reshuffled by his predecessor, but he doesn't see it as a problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''Obviously, Dave was the general manager, so he made the final decision on all of those deals,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>''But I had been the one that coordinated all of the information about the players involved in the moves, and I agreed with every one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>''When I agreed to take the job on Saturday, Mr. Ilitch assured me that he is still committed to building a team that can win championships,'' Avila said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>''We're not going to be in cost-cutting mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>AP freelance writer Dave Hogg contributed to this report.</td></tr>
