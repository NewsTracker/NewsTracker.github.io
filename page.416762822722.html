<h3>Israel's Netanyahu scrambles to form governing coalition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scrambling to get his governing coalition together ahead of a deadline Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu has had a tough time striking deals with potential partners to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If he fails by the end of day Wednesday, President Reuven Rivlin will task someone else with the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu's efforts hit a snag Monday when a key ally, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, unexpectedly resigned and announced his party is joining the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Later that night, Netanyahu teamed up with Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last week, the center-right Kulanu party and another ultra-Orthodox party joined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But he still was negotiating Tuesday with the nationalist Jewish Home party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A deal would give him a narrow majority, setting the stage for an unstable government.</td></tr>
