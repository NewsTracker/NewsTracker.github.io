<tr><td>2</td><td>The euro advanced for a fourth day against the dollar after Greece pledged to make a payment to the International Monetary Fund on time this week.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>due on April 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The market's pretty much siding with the view that Greece will make that payment," said Prashant Newnaha, a rates strategist at TD Securities Inc. in Singapore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece must reach an outline funding agreement with its lenders at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on April 24, its finance minister told a Greek newspaper on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"At the Eurogroup (meeting) of April 24 there must be a preliminary conclusion (of the talks), as per the Eurogroup accord on Feb. 20," Yanis Varoufakis told the newspaper Naftemporiki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece offered a new package of reforms last week in the hope of unlocking remaining funds from its bailout program, but its EU and IMF lenders have yet to agree to the proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Athens has not received bailout aid since August, 2014, and has been hard pressed to cover payments amid a cash crunch, resorting to measures such as borrowing from state entities to tide it over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A source with knowledge of the issue told Reuters last month that Greece had enough funds to last it until April 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr. Varoufakis said on Sunday following a meeting with International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde that Greece intended to meet all obligations to all its creditors, moving to quell fears of a possible default ahead of a 450-million IMF loan repayment later this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He told Naftemporiki the new leftist-led government, confronted with a liquidity squeeze, wanted negotiations to be concluded "as soon as possible," but would not accept terms that suffocated the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We are not going to condemn the country, as previous governments did, to a long-term asphyxiation," Mr. Varoufakis told the paper, suggesting the EU/IMF lenders had treated the previous conservative-led government more leniently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The negotiations will end when we reach an honourable agreement, which will give the Greek economy the prospect of real stabilization and substantive growth," Mr. Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
