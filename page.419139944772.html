<h3>Red Sox trade 1B Mike Napoli back to Rangers (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SEATTLE (AP) -- Mike Napoli is headed back to Texas, where he played in a World Series before going on to win one with Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The first baseman was traded Friday to the Rangers from the Red Sox for a player to be named or cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Boston also sent money to Texas as part of the deal, which came a week after baseball's deadline for trading players without placing them on waivers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said reacquiring Napoli fills the team's need for a right-handed bat with power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''He is a guy who always hits lefties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's an area where we have struggled this year,'' Daniels said on a conference call Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''He is a guy we know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>We know he's going to fit our culture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Minutes before the first pitch of Boston's game at Detroit on Friday night, Napoli was removed from the lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He batted .207 with 13 homers and 40 RBIs in 98 games for the last-place Red Sox this year and can become a free agent after the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Napoli, 33, was a fan favorite during two productive years in Texas before signing with the Red Sox and helping them win the 2013 World Series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He batted .320 with a career-high 30 homers as the Rangers won their second consecutive American League pennant in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He hit .350 with two home runs and 10 RBIs in the World Series loss to St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The following season, Napoli had 24 homers in 108 games and was the AL's starting catcher in the All-Star Game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>With his return to Texas, Napoli is back in the playoff chase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Rangers (54-53) had won four straight entering Friday night's series opener in Seattle and were 2 1/2 games behind in the race for the second AL wild card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Texas was 5 1/2 back of first-place Houston in the AL West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''This is really about 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He fills a need for us,'' Daniels said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Hoping to make a postseason push, the Rangers' front office has been aggressive lately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Texas acquired ace lefty Cole Hamels and reliever Jake Diekman from Philadelphia at the trade deadline, plus reliever Sam Dyson from Miami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While the three pitchers obtained last week are under contract or Rangers control for multiple seasons after this, Napoli is not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mitch Moreland started his 70th game at first base Friday night, while Prince Fielder was the designated hitter for the 90th time, along with his 15 starts at first base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They were among five left-handed batters in the lineup against the Mariners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Napoli is expected to join the club Saturday, when the Rangers are set to face Seattle lefty Mike Montgomery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Daniels said the initial plan is for Napoli to be the DH or first baseman against left-handers, and only be used as an emergency third catcher, similar to the role he has had with the Red Sox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Rangers were hitting just .238 against left-handed pitching, ranking 24th in the majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That's been one of Napoli's strengths in the past, but he's batting only .229 against lefties this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Before this year, Napoli was a .279 hitter in his career against left-handers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Texas transferred Kyle Blanks to the 60-day disabled list to clear a spot on the 40-man roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Rangers will need to make another move to open a spot on the 25-man roster when Napoli arrives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>AP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Arlington, Texas, and freelance writer Scott Held in Detroit contributed to this report.</td></tr>
