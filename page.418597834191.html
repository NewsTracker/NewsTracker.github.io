<h3>Google Soars on 2Q Results, YouTube Growth</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google Inc's (GOOGL) shares surged as much as 14.5 percent on Friday, adding nearly $60 billion to its market value, as strong growth in mobile ad revenue allayed concerns its YouTube business could be hurt by Facebook Inc's push into video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The surge in the stock, which sent the Nasdaq composite index to a record intraday high, came a day after Google reported better-than-expected revenue and profit for the first time in six quarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Shares of Google, the world's most valuable company after Apple Inc , hit a record high of $688.81, valuing the Web search giant at about $460 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At least 24 brokerages raised their price targets on Google's stock by as much as $150 to as high as $800, with analysts also welcoming new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat's emphasis on disciplined spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Online video ads could be a $17 billion opportunity in the United States alone by 2017 and YouTube looks best positioned to benefit, Jefferies & Co analysts wrote in a note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Second, new CFO Ruth Porat will take a more disciplined approach to expense management and capital allocation - welcome news," they wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Google said watch time for YouTube rose 60 percent in the second quarter and the video service roped in more viewers aged 18-49 than any U.S. cable network on mobile alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google and Facebook are trying to woo big companies to market their products via online videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>YouTube has an edge over Facebook as it has a more mature monetization platform that seems to attract the best content, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google said the gap was closing between mobile and desktop "cost per click" (CPC), or the average price of online ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mobile CPCs are likely to exceed desktop CPCs in the long term, Munster said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Google's CPCs fell 11 percent in the quarter but that is not the complete story, Jefferies analysts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>YouTube TrueView ads, where advertisers pay only when users don't skip an ad, cost less than traditional search ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Google's fast rampup of YouTube monetization is also hurting pricing, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The company's advertising revenue rose 11 percent to $16.02 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The number of paid clicks increased 18 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This growth has steadily held in the mid-to-high teens since at least Q1:13," RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Such consistency is a rarity, especially for a behemoth business..."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Of 48 analysts covering the stock, 38 have "buy" or higher rating, while 10 have "hold."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The median price target is $672, according to Thomson Reuters data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Google's shares were up about 14 percent at $685.52 after 20 minutes of trading on the Nasdaq.</td></tr>
