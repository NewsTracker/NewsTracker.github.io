<h3>Crimea exiles fight to keep Ukraine unity message alive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For 11 days, Andrei Schekun said, they beat him, shocked him with electrodes and scalded him with burning metallic plates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the torture took place as Crimea voted in a referendum to secede from Ukraine a year ago Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Schekun's crime: campaigning to persuade his fellow Crimeans to reject absorption by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Schekun's crusade for Ukrainian unity, which he continues today in exile, began as pro-Moscow sentiment among the majority ethnic Russian population reached fever pitch on the peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Demands for a split from Ukraine spiked within days of the February ouster of Moscow-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although most Ukrainians resented the president with feverish intensity for his predatory rule, people in regions such as Crimea and eastern Ukraine, with dominant ethnic Russian populations, viewed him with more sympathy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russian state television stations already fed them a steady diet of stories about unrest being led by rabid Ukrainian nationalists bent on oppression of the Russian population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ill-intentioned Ukrainians, the Russian networks warned, were poised to descend upon Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Schekun's activism in drumming up support in Crimea for the anti-government protests that toppled Yanukovych was enough to make him suspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Soon flyers appeared in the courtyard outside Schekun's home in the Crimean town of Bakhchysarai describing him as a traitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Everywhere in the district where we lived, they stuck up leaflets with his face, calling him a bloodthirsty traitor and a fascist, and all kinds of other things," said Schekun's wife, Lyudmila, speaking from their new home outside Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Schekun, along with his wife and three sons, are among the roughly 20,000 people who Ukrainian officials say have left Crimea for the mainland since the region was annexed by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On March 9, one week before the referendum, plain-clothed policemen detained Schekun at a train station in the Crimean capital of Simferopol, as he awaited the delivery of Ukrainian flags and symbols.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The group was from a self-described militia charged with ensuring the referendum on joining Russia proceeded smoothly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They thought we wanted to derail their referendum," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They thought we were some kind of terrorist group or something."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Pro-Ukrainian activism inside Crimea has become an even more dangerous proposition since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Last week, a small group of Crimea residents marked the day of Ukraine's national poet Taras Shevchenko by gathering outside his statue in Simferopol with Ukrainian flags.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That minor act of defiance earned them 40 hours hard labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The peninsula's Tatar minority, whose leadership resisted Russian annexation, says it too has been subjected to intimidation that has ranged from petty official harassment to beatings, kidnappings and murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Speaking at a United Nations conference in Geneva on Monday, the human rights envoy for Ukraine's parliament, Valeriya Lutkovskaya, described Crimea as a "peninsula of terror."</td></tr>

<h3>Andy Fraser, 'All Right Now' Songwriter And Free Bassist, Dead At 62</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - Andy Fraser, who co-wrote the rousing rock anthem "All Right Now" when he was the teenage bassist for the British rock band Free, has died in California at age 62.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fraser had been living in the Southern California desert community of Temecula, where he died Monday, the Riverside County coroner said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The cause of death is not yet known and remains under investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At age 15, the London-born Fraser briefly became a member of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The group functioned as a training ground for young British rockers including Eric Clapton and Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Within a year, Fraser became a founding member of Free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The band's most prominent member was singer and guitarist Paul Rodgers, who would also go on to front Bad Company and The Firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The band's biggest hit by far was 1970's "All Right Now," which remains one of the defining hits of classic rock radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fraser also produced the track and plays a bass solo on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The song is also a staple of football stadiums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Stanford University and University of Southern California marching bands each play it at virtually every game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Fraser kept playing music for most of his life, but he would never equal the success he had as a teen with Free, which broke up in 1972.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He and Rodgers took the stage together to play "All Right Now" at Woodstock '94, the reboot of the classic music festival.</td></tr>
