<h3>Primary school bans pupils from watching next week's solar eclispe - in case they get BLINDED</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Whitchurch Primary School in Cardiff said it will not let children watch the natural display outside, even if they have bought special glasses with solar filters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Instead, the primary school will show the eclipse on a live feed inside the school premises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on Friday, March 20, and will be visible for thousands of kilometres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The decision came following an email which was reportedly sent to the schools by Cardiff Council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The memo advised schools to read a leaflet from the Royal Astronomical Society on how to observe an eclipse safely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Advice in the leaflet states that 'the sun is so bright that just looking at it can blind you, so you'll need to prepare beforehand'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A council spokeswoman said: 'We are not telling schools they should not allow children out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'We have left that decision to the schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It goes on to state 'there are various ways to observe it (the eclipse) safely, using both everyday materials and telescopes or binoculars'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>These can also include eclipse viewers, colanders, pinhole viewers, and mirrors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It is believed the schools were left to provide the equipment themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A second school in the area, Fairwater Primary School, said it would not be making any changes to the school day to accommodate the eclipse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Meanwhile, Bryn Hafod Primary School, also in the area, said it needed to do a 'health and safety assessment' before it would make a decision on whether to allow children to watch the eclipse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>During the landmark event, the Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth, casting a deep shadow over the planet's surface in a partial eclipse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Unlike 1999, it will not be a total eclipse over Britain, although that will happen over the North Atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the North Pole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The next similar eclipse will not take place over Britain until August 2026.</td></tr>
