<h3>Fragment from MH17 crash site supports missile theory: Dutch TV</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A metal fragment from the crash site of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 matches a surface-to-air BUK rocket, a Dutch broadcaster said on Thursday, supporting a theory that the plane was downed by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The fragment was recovered by a Dutch journalist from the village of Hrabove several months ago near to where the plane was brought down last July, killing all 298 passengers and crew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dutch broadcaster RTL said it had had the shrapnel tested by international forensic experts, including defense analysts IHS Jane's in London, who said it matched the explosive charge of a BUK, a Russian-made anti-aircraft missile system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The downing of the plane was a turning point in the conflict in Ukraine, which pits the separatists against Kiev's forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kiev and its Western supporters blamed the rebels for the incident and it stiffened the resolve of Western governments to impose sanctions against both leading separatists and Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Dutch Safety Board, which is investigating the cause of the crash, said in a reaction that its investigation was in "full progress and focuses on many more sources than only the shrapnel".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In preliminary conclusions published last year, the board said the plane had been hit by high velocity projectiles but did not specify the source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Additional investigation material is welcome, but it is imperative that it can be indisputably shown that there is a relationship between the material and the downed aircraft," it said in a statement on Thursday.</td></tr>
