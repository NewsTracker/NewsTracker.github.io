<h3>NC State in Sweet 16 with 71-68 stunner over No. 1 Villanova (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The rims seemed tight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>So did Villanova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Wildcats missed so many shots - gimme layups, uncontested jumpers, airballed 3s - that it was no surprise the first thing to fall was their Final Four target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No wonder it came to this: The 'Cats were the first to go from a top seed to No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>1-and-done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>North Carolina State, a program that authored one of the early chapters on March shockers, can add another stunner to the list: The Wolfpack are back in the Sweet 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>N.C. State attacked one of the top teams in the nation for 40 minutes, playing with a chest-thumping swagger that helped them stun Villanova 71-68 on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>N.C. State guards Cat Barber and Desmond Lee shared a long embrace after the buzzer as their teammates danced around the court in celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>No, this wasn't quite as meaningful as Jim Valvano's mad dash looking for somebody - anybody - to hug after the Wolfpack won the 1983 national championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the Wolfpack (22-13) have designs on their own big March run and will move on to Syracuse, New York to play the winner of the Louisville-Northern Iowa game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Lacey led them with 17 points, Barber had 13 and Malik-Adbul Abu had 13 points, 12 rebounds and absolutely destroyed the Wildcats inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Wildcats (33-3) saw a 16-game winning streak end and have not reached the second weekend since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Wildcats come up empty after storming their way to pair of Big East titles and a 41-point victory in the NCAA Tournament opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I know we have to answer to the fact that we did not get to the second weekend again,'' coach Jay Wright said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''We have to own that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But it's not going to define us within our program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Dylan Ennis was nearly inconsolable, his arms crossed over his head in disbelief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ennis missed a 3-pointer after an N.C. State turnover with 20 seconds left that would have put the Wildcats ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Darrun Hilliard scored 27 points and gamely rallied the Wildcats in the final minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He hit 3-pointers that brought them to within four, within two with 41.1 seconds left and 69-68 with 1.2 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ralston Turner sealed the win with free throws and N.C. State was back in the Sweet 16 for only the third time since 1989 (2012, 2005).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They hadn't defeated a top seed since that memorable night in 1983 when they upset Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Yet for the all the Wolfpack did right to keep the 'Cats on their heels, they never went on that decisive run that would have ended a comeback threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Barber lost the ball and N.C. State's ninth turnover led to Josh Hart's three-point play with 3:51 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Wolfpack didn't have to win with authority, though - they just had to win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Desmond Lee's three-point play stretched the lead back to seven and put them minutes away from the signature win under coach Mark Gottfried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Wins over Duke, North Carolina and Louisville in ACC play let them know they could knock off the elite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''We respect Villanova, but we've seen good teams,'' Gottfried said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''We've seen a lot of them in our conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>You see them about every night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Gottfried also has a knack for pulling off March upsets - he led eighth-seeded Alabama to a win over No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>1 Stanford in the second round of the 2004 tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Wildcats have one more March failure to tack on the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>They shot a season-high 63 percent in the tournament opener against Lafayette.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Against the Wolfpack, they fired 'em early in the shot clock, got stuffed at the rim and twice airballed 3-point attempts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>These were the top-seeded Big East champs?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In the first half, the Wildcats missed a whopping 20 of 28 field goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Hart, the Big East tournament MVP, played just 4 minutes after he was whistled for two fast fouls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''I don't think missing those layups or those easy baskets really fazed us, it was just our decision making in taking them,'' Hilliard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>NC State: The Wolfpack did not attempt a free throw until there was 2:27 left in the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>... N.C. State held a 45-32 edge on the boards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>... The Wolfpack missed 8 of 11 3-pointers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Villanova: The Wildcats shot 31 percent (19 of 61).</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>... The Wildcats have not won more than one game in the NCAA Tournament since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The Wolfpack had four players reach double-digit scoring and two of them had double-doubles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>JayVaughn Pinkston scored 13 and was the only other Wildcat to crack double digits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Four players averaged double digits in the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>NC State: Will play the winner of Louisville-Northern Iowa game in the Sweet 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Villanova: Season finished.</td></tr>
