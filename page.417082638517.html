<h3>Beyonc? and Jay Z wired bail money to Baltimore and Ferguson protesters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jay Z and Beyonce privately donated tens of thousands to bail out protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson, says the hip hop mogul's ghost writer.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>'When BLM [Black Lives Matter] needed infrastructure money for the many chapters that we're growing like beautiful dandelions, Carters wrote a huge check.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hampton later wrote that she deleted the tweets because Jay Z 'would be pi-issed to see I was offering evidence' that he is taking action.</td></tr>
