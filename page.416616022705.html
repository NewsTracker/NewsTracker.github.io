<h3>News24.com | Netanyahu signs first partners in new coalition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jerusalem - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed up his first partners on Wednesday for a new coalition government, a lawmaker and spokesperson said, putting him on course to lead a heavily right-leaning cabinet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The deals with the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism (UTJ) party and centrist Kulanu give Netanyahu's right-wing Likud control of 46 of parliament's 120 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu's emerging government is likely to pursue tough policies towards the Palestinians, including further settlement building in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, lands the Palestinians seek for a state along with the Gaza Strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On the eve of the March 17 election, he drew international outrage by declaring there would be no Palestinian state on his watch, backtracking from a 2009 pledge to pursue a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He has until May 7 to form a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We signed a coalition deal with the Likud just now," UTJ leader Yakov Litzman told Israeli's Channel One.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu then signed with centrist Kulanu party, a Likud spokesperson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Likud is still negotiating with three other parties with whom it is expected to secure a 67-seat majority: ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu, far-right Jewish Home and ultra-Orthodox Shas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His outgoing cabinet included two centrist parties and had engaged in US-brokered peace talks with the Palestinians, which collapsed a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Jewish Home is a pro-settler party which advocates the annexation of most the West Bank, a policy Netanyahu has not embraced but which some Likud members support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Avigdor Lieberman, the hawkish head of Yisrael Beitenu, is expected to continue as foreign minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Although Netanyahu has since sought to step back from his pre-election remark on Palestinian statehood, US President Barack Obama told him Washington would reassess its options on US-Israel relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It would appear that we are entering a period without a real or realistic possibility for holding negotiations on a solution of two states for two peoples," US Ambassador Dan Shapiro told Israel's Army Radio in an interview on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some Israeli political commentators have suggested Netanyahu may seek to bring in centre-left Zionist Union at a later stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In public comments however, its leader Isaac Herzog has so far ruled that option out, as has Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Centrist Kulanu, whose leader Moshe Kahlon who will serve as finance minister, and the ultra-Orthodox parties ran on internal social-economic issues, not on matters of war and peace.</td></tr>
