<h3>FIFA hires crisis consultants as first official extradited to U.S.</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK/ZURICH (Reuters) - A sports marketing executive who was indicted along with 13 other people in a U.S. corruption case that has rocked the soccer world has been discussing a plea deal with prosecutors, according to a court filing on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Aaron Davidson, who was the head of Traffic Group's U.S. unit in Miami, has since his arrest in May been "actively engaged in plea negotiations," prosecutors said in a letter filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The letter was filed ahead of a court hearing for Davidson scheduled for Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Davidson's lawyer declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Court proceedings in the sprawling corruption case are ramping up, as Swiss authorities have extradited to the United States a defendant who was among seven current and former FIFA officials arrested in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>FIFA, soccer's world governing body, has hired a New York-based crisis communications and consulting firm, Teneo, to help handle the multinational probes and try to restore its tarnished image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Swiss authorities did not name the extradited official, but the news came six days after a source told Reuters that Jeffrey Webb, one of the seven executives arrested on May 27, had agreed not to fight his extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In May, Davidson pleaded not guilty to charges that he secured sports marketing contracts worth more than $35 million for Traffic, in part by arranging bribes for Webb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He posted a $5 million (3 million pound) bond and is under house arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The letter filed in court on Thursday did not give details of the plea negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It said prosecutors had begun disclosing some material to Davidson's lawyers that could be used as evidence in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At a March 2014 meeting in New York that the indictment said had been called to discuss bribe schemes, Davidson allegedly said to a co-conspirator, "Is it illegal? It is illegal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The indictment charged soccer officials and marketing executives with exploiting the sport for their own gain through bribes of $150 million over 24 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The owner of Traffic, Brazilian Jose Hawilla, has already pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy, obstruction of justice and other charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Davidson and the others have been swept up in a U.S.-led probe into allegations of bribery, fraud and money laundering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The probe includes possible corruption in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments to Russia and Qatar, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>FIFA's hiring of Teneo, a crisis communications and advisory firm, "to work across operational and reputational priorities" as a FIFA spokeswoman explained it, represents the organization's latest attempt to contain the fallout from the scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Teneo declined to comment, but its executives include a number of people who have worked on World Cup bids, among them its president, Doug Band, who was a director of a U.S. campaign to host the tournament in 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.S. bid lost out to Qatar in a vote of FIFA executive committee members that is now one subject of the U.S. and Swiss investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In another sign of how FIFA is grappling with pressure to improve transparency, its ethics committee, responsible for investigating the corruption allegations, on Thursday called for a change in rules to let it release more information about ongoing investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Webb, 50, and six others were jailed after a dawn raid on a luxury hotel in Zurich just two days before a FIFA congress in May where President Sepp Blatter, 79, was re-elected for a fifth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A citizen of the Cayman Islands, Webb is charged with racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Neither his lawyer nor a U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman responded to requests for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The U.S. indictment describes Webb as using his influential positions to solicit bribes from sports marketing companies in exchange for the commercial rights to soccer matches.</td></tr>
