<h3>German Anti-Euro Party Scraps Congress Amid Infighting</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An upstart German party that combines an anti-euro stance with tough talk on immigration has called off a planned congress amid increasingly ugly infighting over its leadership and future course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It initially focused on talk of ending the euro currency in its current form, but many members increasingly have centered their pitch around tough talk about immigration and crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That has been accompanied by public backbiting among its leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Party spokesman Christian Lueth said Tuesday that the leadership decided to call off a congress planned for June 13-14 because of "legal concerns."</td></tr>
