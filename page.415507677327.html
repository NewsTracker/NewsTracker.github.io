<h3>Facebook explains what posts are not allowed on its network</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In an update to its community standards page on Monday, March 16, 2015, the world's largest online social network explained its thinking on what posts, images and other content it allows on its site and why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Facebook is trying to clarify what posts, images and other content it allows on its site and why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In an update to its community standards page, the world's largest online social network gave users more guidance on why, for example, it might take down a post that featured sexual violence and exploitation, hate speech, criminal activity or bullying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It also explained why it not only bans terrorist and organized crime groups, but it also removes content supporting them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Menlo Park, California-based company said it isn't changing how it regulates the content of posts, and that while some of the guidance for users is new, "it is consistent with how we've applied our standards in the past."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a blog post Monday, Facebook said it is a challenge to maintain one set of standards that meet the needs of its entire community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>More than 80 percent of Facebook users are outside the U.S. and Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"People from different backgrounds may have different ideas about what's appropriate to share - a video posted as a joke by one person might be upsetting to someone else, but it may not violate our standard," wrote Monika Bickert, head of global policy management, and Chris Sonderby, deputy general counsel, in the post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Facebook users who believe that a particular page or content violates the site's standards can click a "report" link to notify Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The company then considers whether to take it down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some content is only removed in some countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Facebook restricts content in countries where it violates local laws, even if that content does not violate its community standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Separately, Facebook also released its latest report on requests it gets from governments worldwide, covering the second half of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The report shows that requests from governments for data and to restrict information are both increasing.</td></tr>

<h3>This VR Demo Let Me Soar Over San Francisco Like a Bird</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Because I am a bird.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>I have not grown feathers or a beak, but I have folded myself face-down into a padded recliner, and I have an Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset on my face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>I&#x2019;m experiencing a demo of Birdly, hosted by Google at a SXSW exhibit space for the Google Fiber broadband service coming here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The relevance of a bird simulation to a $70 a month gigabit fiber is left as an exercise for the reader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Birdly project, by Zurich-based Somniacs, starts with a 3-D computer model of San Francisco that&#x2019;s displayed to you in the Oculus headset&#x2019;s two screens (one for each eye).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The vista changes as you look up, down and around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And you use your arms to raise, lower and flap large paddles &#x2014; your wings &#x2014; on each side of the recliner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Headphones bring you the sound of the breeze and of other birds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And to complete the illusion, a fan blows air at your head, faster if you flap harder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If nausea sets in, you can press a red button on either paddle to stop the demo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As I flapped my arms up and down, I banked past the Transamerica Pyramid&#x2019;s cap, looked right towards the city&#x2019;s piers, the Financial District, and the Bay Bridge, and decided to have a look at&#xA0;Coit Tower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I raised one arm to roll left, then vigorously flapped to cover the distance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As a few fellow avians flew past me in the other direction, Telegraph Hill rose up to meet me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I banked around the tower, seemingly only a few feet from its cast concrete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>(I was close enough to expose the limits of the 3-D model: The tower&#x2019;s distinctive arches looked blurry.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I resumed flapping, hoping to pick up speed, and make my way out over the Bay &#x2014; and then time ran out on the demo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On their site, the developers (Max Rheiner, Fabian Troxler, Thomas Tobler, Vladimir Jankijevic, and Thomas Erdin) say they&#x2019;re working to add smell to Birdly&#x2019;s sensory experience: Flying over a farm, for example, might get you the scent of dirt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But they haven&#x2019;t gotten that &#x201C;olfactoric feedback&#x201D; out of the lab yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The world may not be overflowing with practical applications for a bird simulator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But I don&#x2019;t care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>For two minutes, I lived the dream of flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And it was convincing enough that I was annoyed to have to use my own feet to walk four blocks to my next SXSW appointment.</td></tr>
