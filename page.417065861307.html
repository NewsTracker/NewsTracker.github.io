<h3>CANNES WATCH: Rooney Mara scores floaty white fashion coup</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES (AP) " Rooney Mara scored a fashion coup at the "Carol" premiere in a diaphanous white gown that upstaged her more famous co-star Cate Blanchett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Thirty-year-old Mara plays opposite Blanchett in the captivating lesbian drama and wowed crowds Sunday with her simple, yet elegant silk dress with delicate halter neck and white make up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blanchett looked typically ravishing, arm in arm with director Todd Haynes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the 46-year-old star's shoulderless bustier dress came over a tad busy with clashing blue prints and huge proportions in the train that ushers needed to help her with.</td></tr>
