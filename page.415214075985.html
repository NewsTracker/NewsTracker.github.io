<h3>Police chief's 'happy snap' with Bali nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Denpasar police chief has denied a grinning photograph of himself and condemned prisoner Andrew Chan was a heartless selfie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bizarre photographs emerged on Indonesian news websites of Senior Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo with his arm draped around Chan's shoulder as if the two were posing for a happy snap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Senior Commissioner Djoko was photographed standing in the aisle of the Wings Air plane that was about to take Chan and Myuran Sukumaran on their last flight before execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Senior Commissioner told Fairfax Media he was trying to raise the spirits of the Australians and had no idea the photo was being taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It was not a selfie moment," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said he was patting the men's shoulders and urging them to "Be tough, be strong, and keep going".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chan, who appears stunned, is looking at the camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The photo was leaked to local media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sukumaran is also photographed, talking to the police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Surrounding the men are Brimob paramilitary officers wearing balaclavas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The fact the photos were leaked to media outlets is paradoxical, given the tight security at Cilacap airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The airport was in lockdown for the arrival of the men on a Wings Air flight and armed Brimob and police officers even patrolled the perimeter fences in the jungle to stop journalists from taking photos of the men's arrival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The men, organisers of a heroin smuggling syndicate, were taken by ferry from Cilacap to the Nusakambangan prison island, where they are due to be executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The families of the condemned men flew into Yogyakarta, in Central Java, on Thursday on their way to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Helen Chan, Andrew's mother, joined her son Michael after flying in from Sydney on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Chinthu and Brintha Sukumaran, Myuran's brother and sister, were on the same plane, with other family members and supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They joined Raji Sukumaran, Myuran's mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Michael Chan and Raji Sukumaran had remained in Bali while other families recently returned home to renew their visas and take a brief break from the emotional strain of visiting Kerobokan prison each day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The families were picked up by consular vehicles on the tarmac and whisked away to Cilacap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They will be permitted to visit the Bali nine pair on Nusakambangan, where the men are being held in isolation cells.</td></tr>
