<h3>Germanwings crash: Lubitz told Lufthansa of depression</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lufthansa's chief executive had previously said the company was not aware of anything that could have driven the co-pilot to crash the Airbus A320 into the French Alps and that he was 100 per cent fit to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lufthansa said Andreas Lubitz broke off his pilot training for a period of several months but then passed medical checks confirming his fitness to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When he resumed training in 2009, he provided the flight school with medical documents showing that he had gone through a "previous episode of severe depression," Lufthansa said, citing emailed correspondence between Lubitz and the flight school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dusseldorf state prosecutors said on Monday that Lubitz had been treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot's licence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They last week found torn-up sick notes showing that Lubitz was suffering from an illness that should have grounded him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Germanwings said it had not received a sick note from Lubitz for the day of the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Lufthansa said it had passed the email correspondence and additional documents to the Duesseldorf prosecutors after internal investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lufthansa was already facing unlimited liability for damages in the crash, lawyers have said, and has told its insurers to set aside $300 million to deal with claims, recovery costs and the loss of the aircraft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tuesday's statement is likely to raise further questions over pilot screening processes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Lawyers representing some of the families of victims of the Germanwings crash called on Tuesday for more psychiatric testing of pilots.</td></tr>
