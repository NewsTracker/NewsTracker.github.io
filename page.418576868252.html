<h3>On the brink, EU leaders clinched bailout deal _ with an SMS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras speaks with the media after a meeting of eurozone heads of state at the EU Council building in Brussels on Monday, July 13, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A summit of eurozone leaders reached a tentative agreement with Greece on Monday for a bailout program that includes "serious reforms" and aid, removing an immediate threat that Greece could collapse financially and leave the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) - As dawn broke in Brussels on Monday, Europe's frazzled leaders gazed into an abyss: the looming exit of Greece from a common currency that symbolized European unity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hours past a midnight deadline to clinch a Greek bailout deal, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras were about to walk away from the table - exhausted from all-night talks filled with threats, shouting and ultimatums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A single text message rescued the talks - and possibly the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dutch Premier Mark Rutte, a hard-liner on Greek reform waiting outside with other leaders, sent European Union President Donald Tusk an SMS proposing a compromise on the last sticking point keeping the two sides apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For three hours, Merkel, Tsipras, Tusk and French President Francois Hollande had been stuck in dead-end closed-door talks, and the message suddenly made something click.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Within an hour, the deal was clinched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This account of the dramatic events that led to a last-minute bailout agreement for Greece has been pieced together from interviews with a half-dozen officials from EU nations and institutions who attended the negotiations over the past months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were not public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Announcing the deal later that morning, Tusk, the summit host - who had been instrumental in keeping the opposing sides together before the text message landed - tried to lighten the mood with corny humor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We have an a-Greek-ment," he declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was not enough to sweep away the months of bitterness leading to that moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The negotiations, watched with trepidation around the world, swung from despair to hope and back again as leaders groped for a pact that would keep Greece in the euro and keep global markets steady.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Greek crisis, roiling Europe since the election in January of Tsipras - a radical leftist who vowed to free Greece from debilitating austerity - reached a terminal point at the end of June, when the bailout that was keeping Greece afloat was set to expire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Without a deal, Greece would effectively go bankrupt, likely forcing it out of the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Markets were sanguine in the run-up to that deadline, amid signs that the two sides were close to an agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But no leader could vouch for what would happen in case of failure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Deep into the night of June 26, after two promising days of summit talks, technical negotiators sat down at EU headquarters to fine-tune the details of what was expected to be the final breakthrough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>So everyone was stunned when the Greek negotiators took cellphone calls, then simply got up and left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tsipras returned to the Greek capital that night, and hastily convened his Cabinet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Hours later, he made a televised address that shocked Europe: He was calling a referendum for the following weekend on whether to accept the European bailout plan - and advocating a 'No' vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"From an economic, financial and social point of view it was an absolute disaster," said Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Within hours, lines had formed at ATM machines across Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The bank run continued throughout the weekend, and the government was left with little choice by Sunday night but to declare that banks would be shuttered the following week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It imposed capital controls, restricting cash withdrawals to 60 euros ($67) per day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The overwhelming "No" vote in the July 5 referendum was a triumph for Tsipras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Emboldened by what he saw as a strong mandate to bargain further with Greece's creditors, he returned to the negotiating table - but not before asking for the resignation of Yanis Varoufakis, his brash finance minister.</td></tr>
