<h3>Google IS working on Android Pay - and confirms plans to offer mobile network plans 'on a small scale'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Vice president Sundar Pichai said the firm is working with unnamed operators during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rumours claim it will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Elsewhere, Mr Pichai confirmed Google was working on Android Pay as well as Project Loon, designed to connect more urban areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google has confirmed year-long rumours it will be offering mobile network plans in the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Speaking at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, vice president Sundar Pichai said the tech giant is working with unnamed network operators on developing a cellular plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'You will see us announce it in the coming months, I think we are at a stage where it is important to think about hardware, software and connectability together,' said the 43-year-old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr PIchai also confirmed rumours that Google is working on a payment service and unveiled plans for its Project Loon - designed to connect urban areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The rumours of a Google mobile network plan first emerged in April last year, and the unnamed networks are believed to be Sprint and T-Mobile in the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing 3G and 4G networks at wholesale prices and sell the connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This would make Google a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) similar to Lycamobile in the US that runs on T-Mobile's network, and Tesco Mobile in the UK which shares O2's networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The company can then use these network to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>WHAT IS A MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a company that offers mobile service plans using existing networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The company can then use this access to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Lycamobile in the U.S, for example, is an MVNO because it runs on T-Mobile's network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the UK, Tesco Mobile shares O2's, and ultimately Telefonica's, networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He described the plans as a 'project' and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In particular, Mr Pichai said the setup should provide at seamless connection between Wi-Fi and mobile networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Sources said at the time of the original rumours that any Google-branded mobile network would initially launch in cities that have Google Fiber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Google launched its 1000mps Fiber broadband service in 2011, starting with Kansas City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In 2013, the firm announced it was expanding the service to Austin in Texas, Provo in Utah and a number of other towns in Missouri and California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>More locations are due to be added later this year, but the roll-out is slow because Google has to install the relevant infrastructure needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Google Fiber starts at $70 ( 42) a month and has been praised for offering high speeds at relatively low prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Google's wireless plans would remove some of the costs, and time spent, in setting up its own network and it would equally benefit from using already established and well-connected networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>This could help Google cement itself as an internet service provider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Google could additionally use the network to sell its Nexus range of phones, for example, with contract or service plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Mr Pichai also used the event to announce the launch of Google Fiber in more urban areas and to announce Project Loon, designed to bring connectivity to rural areas, and Project Titan - a drone version of Loon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He also confirmed Android Pay will be built into its mobile software and will have NFC components, but won't launch it before Samsung launches its Pay service later this year.</td></tr>

<h3>Public barred from jury selection in girl's running death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - Potential jurors reported amid secrecy Monday for the capital murder trial of an Alabama woman charged in her granddaughter's running death, with the judge refusing public access to process that typically is open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dozens of prospective jurors assembled at the Etowah County Courthouse for questioning by attorneys in the trial of Joyce Hardin Garrard, 59, of Boaz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jury selection will take days but it's unclear exactly how long, partly because Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree barred the media from being present as prosecutors and defense lawyers talked to would-be jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>University of Alabama law professor Joseph Colquitt, a former circuit judge, said judges often allow attorneys to ask some personal questions of jurors in private, but he had never been involved in a case involving an adult defendant where the entire process was closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Basically the idea is that the proceedings in criminal cases are open to the public," said Colquitt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities contend Garrard killed 9-year-old Savannah Hardin three years ago by making her run for hours as punishment for a lie about eating candy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The woman could receive the death penalty if convicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Garrard has pleaded not guilty, and her attorneys blame the child's death on pre-existing medical problems and unspecified things that happened after her collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jury selection will be critical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The panel must eventually decide whether the woman meant to kill the child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Criminal trials generally are open to the public, and the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure state that "all proceedings shall be open to the public, unless otherwise provided by law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ogletree previously issued an order setting rules for media coverage of Garrard's trial, but it makes no mention of the public being banned from jury selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Etowah County Circuit Clerk Cassandra Johnson told The Associated Press that judges in the county, located about 60 miles northeast of Birmingham, typically don't allow the public to witness jury selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Attorneys involved in the case cannot comment publicly because of a gag order that Ogletree imposed following Garrard's arrest in 2012.</td></tr>
