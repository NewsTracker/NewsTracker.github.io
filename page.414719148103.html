<h3>The 50 things every 'real' man needs to know</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Men should also know how to wet shave, polish their shoes and give a confident handshake, the study of 2,000 adults found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A 'real' man should also know how to light a barbecue, what the scores were at the weekend - and recognise that when a woman says she is 'fine' it means she is not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Survival skills: 'Real' men should know how to light a barbecue, read a map and start a campfire, according to the study of 2,000 adults.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The research, which was commissioned by William Hill, concluded a man should also know his wedding anniversary without having to pause to think.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Which way is north, where the car's spare tyre is kept and how much fuel you have left when the petrol light comes on also made the top 50 list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A spokesman for bookmakers William Hill said: 'The results show the range of skills, facts and ways of thinking that we associate with the modern man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'It shows a good blend of traditional values long associated with masculinity and the ability to master tasks that perhaps don't come as easily to the modern man as they might to the generation before them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other essential things to know in life were basic DIY, laundry and even map reading skills appeared in the 50 man facts, while acing parallel parking and driving in snow were also necessities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sporting a well-knotted tie, being able to introduce himself confidently and also knowing his own alcohol limits are also important qualities for a man to be familiar with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And it would appear cave-man qualities are still well regarded - knowing how to start a camp fire, carve meat properly and light a barbecue all appear in the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Knowing the words to the national anthem, knowing the weekend's football scores and having an opinion on who are favourites to win the Premier League also crept into the top 50.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While being able to undo a bra one-handed, understanding betting odds and how to choose a good wine all narrowly missed out on the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Knowing to never call a woman 'cuddly' or 'bubbly', what the first rule of the film Fight Club is and having an opinion on the best James Bond were also just outside the top 50 list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nearly half the men studied felt they weren't up to scratch based on the number of the 50 things they were able to tick off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Just 46 per cent felt they could consider themselves a 'manly' man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A fifth of men have faked their way through a conversation about football, the study revealed - in a bid to not seem non-sporty.</td></tr>
