<h3>The latest way to pay someone from your phone: Facebook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook's Messenger app will soon let you send your friends money, the latest in a crowded field of services aimed at an increasingly wireless and cashless generation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Services including PayPal, its Venmo unit and the disappearing-photo app Snapchat let you beam money to friends and family using smartphones linked to bank accounts or credit cards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook's entry, announced Tuesday, is free, works with debit cards and is available on Apple and Android mobile devices and on desktop computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The world's largest social network will process the payments and emphasized the service's security features.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Facebook will likely expand internationally after the service becomes available to U.S. users over the coming months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To send money, Messenger users can tap a new "$" icon that's next to the buttons that let you send photos, stickers or a thumbs up sign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Then, enter the amount you want to send, tap "pay" on the top right corner and enter your debit card number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>To receive money for the first time, enter the card number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Once you add your card number, you can create a pin code that you will need to enter the next time you want to send money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Apple devices that have Touch ID, you can enable this instead and authorize transactions using your fingerprint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To help allay concerns about security, Facebook noted that it handles more than a million payments transactions on its site every day for its advertisers and game players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Its payments systems are stored separately from other parts of the Facebook network and receive additional monitoring and control, the company said in a blog post Tuesday.</td></tr>
