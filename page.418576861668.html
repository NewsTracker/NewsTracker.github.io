<h3>Clinton proposes tax breaks for corporate profit-sharing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DOVER, N.H. (AP) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed new incentives Thursday to encourage corporations to share profits with workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Her plan would give businesses that offer employees a share of profits a two-year tax credit equal to at least 15 percent of their profit-sharing payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If a company took full advantage of Clinton's profit-sharing tax credit, an employee earning $50,000 per year, for instance, could receive $5,000 in added income, and the company in turn would get a $750 tax credit for that worker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The plan would place limits on eligible income and exclude high-income workers and firms where only a small percentage of employees benefit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton's campaign says it would cost tens of billions of dollars over ten years, but would be paid for through other cost savings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton has argued that profit-sharing gives employees a bigger stake in companies' success, boosting productivity as well as pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton's "Rising Incomes, Sharing Profits" plan is part of an economic platform she unveiled this week that focused on boosting wages for middle class families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She was discussing it at a town hall event in Dover.</td></tr>
