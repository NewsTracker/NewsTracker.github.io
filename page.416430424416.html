<h3>How Tesla almost sold to Google in 2013</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tesla CEO Elon Musk almost struck a deal to sell his electric luxury car company to Google via Larry Page when it was struggling in early 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tesla wasn't able to turn many initial pre-orders into sales, according to a new book due out May 19 by Ashlee Vance titled "Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future," excerpted by Bloomberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In order to solve the problem, Musk pulled staff from every department into a meeting to manage the crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"If we don't deliver these cars, we are f---ed," Musk told the employees, a person at the meeting told Vance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"So I don't care what job you were doing. Your new job is delivering cars."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The staffers were ordered to start picking up the phones and closing deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>So many customers had deferred orders by the first week of March 2013 that Musk quietly shut down Tesla's factory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Musk reached out to Page to strike a deal, two people familiar with the talks told Vance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Musk proposed that Google buy Tesla outright for $6 billion and provide another $5 billion in capital for factory expansions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Musk had other demands as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He asked for a guarantee that Google wouldn't break up or shut down his company before it produced a third-generation electric car for the mainstream auto market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Musk also wanted to run the new Google-owned Tesla for eight years, or until it began producing such a car.</td></tr>
