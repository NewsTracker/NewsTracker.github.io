<tr><td>11</td><td>Holmes surrendered to police outside the theater.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>He's also charged with possession of explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The trial began with opening statements April 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Over the next 11 weeks, jurors heard from more than 250 witnesses, viewed more than 24 hours of video and saw more than 1,500 photos, some of them disturbing images of the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They also examined scores of pieces of evidence, including Holmes' guns and ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Holmes didn't testify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>SANE OR INSANE?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, which under Colorado law means he acknowledges committing the acts but believes he wasn't responsible because he couldn't tell right from wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Two court-appointed psychiatrists testified he was legally sane; two defense psychiatrists told jurors he was legally insane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Under Colorado law, the jurors will determine whether Holmes was sane or insane.</td></tr>

<tr><td>30</td><td>Counseling will be available to the jurors after they have reached a verdict and the trial is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It took years for the judge, the prosecution and the defense to plow through the mountain of evidence and hash out numerous legal questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Further complicating matters were the number of victims, the prosecution's decision to seek the death penalty and Holmes' decision to plead not guilty by reason of insanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It took nearly three more months to choose the jury after 9,000 summonses were sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Holmes offered to plead guilty if prosecutors would agree to a life sentence without parole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Prosecutors rejected the offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>This story has been corrected to show that jurors heard testimony over 11 weeks, not 10, and that Holmes is charged with 165 counts, not 166.</td></tr>
