<h3>The latest on Baltimore police-custody death: Civil rights group to do probe of Freddie Gray</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A civil rights group says it will conduct its own investigation into the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died of a mysterious spinal injury he suffered after he was arrested by Baltimore police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Baltimore chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference said Thursday that a former Philadelphia police officer will conduct the investigation for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Baltimore police are doing an internal investigation and the Justice Department has opened a probe to see if Gray's civil rights were violated when he was arrested April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>C.D. Witherspoon, the head of the civil rights' group's local chapter, said an independent investigation is needed because police brutality in Baltimore has gone unpunished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We have no faith in City Hall," Witherspoon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"You can prove us wrong. We challenge City Hall to prove us wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Former Philadelphia officer Terence Jones will lead the investigation by speaking with witnesses to the arrest.</td></tr>
