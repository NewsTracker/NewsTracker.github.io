<h3>Egypt to try policeman over death of female protester</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt's state prosecutor referred on Tuesday a police officer to trial for allegedly shooting dead a leftist female protester during a peaceful rally in central Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The death of Shaima al-Sabbagh, which was partly captured on film, prompted President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to publicly demand the perpetrator be brought to justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She suffered the fatal wounds as police dispersed a small march of leftists on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the January 25 uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The marchers had been carrying a wreath to a monument commemorating the deaths of protesters during the revolt that toppled president Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The police officer, who was not named by the prosecution, will stand trial before a criminal court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is the first time a policeman has been referred to trial for allegedly killing someone during a protest since the military's overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, a rights researcher told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police have been accused of killing hundreds of mostly Islamist protesters since Morsi's ouster, including about 700 in one day in August 2013 when police dispersed a Cairo protest camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>About 10 policemen also died in those clashes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A court had sentenced an officer to 10 years in prison for the deaths of 37 detainees arrested at a pro-Morsi protest who suffocated from tear gas inside a police truck, although an appeals court overturned that verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Other policemen have been tried for the deaths of civilians, including an officer who shot dead a detainee in a police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This is the first officer to be tried for killing a civilian in the context of a protest," said Karim Ennarah, a police and criminal justice researcher with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sabbagh's death, a day after another female protester was shot dead during a protest in Alexandria, was swiftly condemned by the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the killing of the other female protester, an Islamist, received little attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sabbagh's Socialist Popular Alliance, a small leftist party, was among the groups that opposed Morsi's divisive year in power before turning against his successor Sisi over a heavy-handed crackdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The prosecutor said an investigation had found the officer shot dead Sabbagh with birdshot, which police often use in crowd control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Police had denied involvement in Sabbagh's death, suggesting the birdshot that perforated her chest was not police-issued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The prosecutor also referred protesters who had taken part in the march to trial for violating a law that bans all but police-sanctioned demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The charges against the police officer exclude murder or manslaughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He is instead charged with "battery that led to death" and "deliberately" wounding other protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ennarah criticised the charges, which he said were "weak".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"When the prosecution can't get away from pressing charges (against policemen), when the abuse is very flagrant and well documented, they press weak charges," Ennarah said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>New York-based Human Rights Watch said it hoped that the case "helps to bring an end to the poisonous cycle of impunity for police violence" since the 2011 uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But it expressed concern that the charges the policeman faces could carry similar prison terms for those at the protest alongside Sabbagh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This, it said, "suggests a false and worrying equivalence between a peaceful protest and a fatal shooting".</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Dozens of policemen were tried for protester deaths after the 2011 uprising against Mubarak, which had been partly fuelled by police abuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Most have been acquitted, including the former police chief and other commanders who stood trial with Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The charges against Mubarak himself were dismissed by the court.</td></tr>
