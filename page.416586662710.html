<tr><td>7</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Optional leather backs and manual camera controls are two ways LG is seeking to distinguish its new G4 phone from Apple's iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>LG's mobile chief, Juno Cho, said a wireless trade show in Barcelona, Spain, last month confirmed LG's belief that smartphones have become clones of one another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I was almost shocked," Cho told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Almost all the phones on display and introduced looked very (much the) same - the same metal casing and emphasis on thinness, overall form factors that are very similar."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The message at Tuesday's announcement of the new G4: We're not like the others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple and Samsung dominate the smartphone market, with LG Electronics Inc. and other companies vying for third place with market shares of less than 5 percent each.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>LG will make phones with traditional backs, too - using metal or ceramic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prices weren't announced, though LG said leather models will cost more in some markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The G4 is available immediately in LG's home country of South Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It will debut around the world in the coming weeks and is expected to reach the U.S. in early June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Apple has long made design a priority, while Samsung began to embrace that this spring with phones that sport a metal frame and a glass back, rather than the plastic used in previous models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In many ways, Samsung's new Galaxy S6 came to resemble Apple's older iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>(The iPhone now has metal backs.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>At Tuesday's announcement, LG made a dig at Samsung, without naming it, by pointing out that glass backs can be marred with fingerprints.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The G4 will have a choice of leather finishes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some of Samsung's older phones had imitation leather backs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The G4 uses real leather and has stitching down the middle - for looks, more than anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>If leather isn't for you, metal and ceramic backs are options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Motorola's Moto X phone offers leather, wood and other non-traditional materials as made-to-order options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>With LG, they are part of standard models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>LG is adding features to improve low-light images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>These are improvements over the average smartphone, though Apple and Samsung have also been incorporating these features - namely, the inclusion of a lens that can open wider to let in more light and reduce blur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The G4 also has a plethora of manual controls, rivaling those of full-body cameras known as single-lens reflex, or SLR.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>LG said no other major smartphone released "this year" has that capability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>LG was careful about the phrasing, as older phones from Nokia - now part of Microsoft - have that level of control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The feature was popular among some experienced photographers, though most people are fine with automatic settings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The G4 differs in letting people save images in RAW format, which permits a greater degree of editing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Most cameras use JPEG, which takes less storage space but introduces distortion in the compression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>One nice feature is the ability to snap a photo by pressing the power button on the back twice, even if the phone's display is off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Samsung's S6 launches the camera with the double press of the home button, but the user still has to then take the shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>LG also made a dig at Samsung for this, without naming the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>As much as LG tries to be different, the layout of the G4's photo gallery resembles the iPhone's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>In an interview, Cho said LG "felt that kind of experience is important for the customer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Few phones have removable batteries these days, in part to keep phones thin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>LG sacrificed thinness so the battery can be removed and replaced with a spare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The G4 also has a slot for a memory card - something lacking in the iPhone and S6 phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>LG keeps the slot - especially important if people start storing all their photos in RAW.</td></tr>
