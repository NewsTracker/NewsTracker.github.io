<h3>Future unsure for troubled New Mexico green chile production</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this Saturday, July 25, 215 photo, workers harvest chile on the 350-acre Adams Produce farm near Hatch, New Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Efforts are underway to save the green chile that's important to traditional New Mexican fare as labor shortages, a previous severe drought and competition from China, India and Mexico endanger its growth in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Green chiles, the signature crop of New Mexico, are in danger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As this year's harvest begins, labor shortages, drought and foreign competition have hurt production in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Farmers and producers say shrinking acreage set aside for the crop also highlights the need for changes in the industry that has helped define New Mexico for generations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To rejuvenate production, investors and inventors are testing machines that would harvest and de-stem the crop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The delicate chiles are now picked by hand, and problems with bruising and the removal of stems have made it difficult to make the change to machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ed Ogaz, owner of chile wholesaler Seco Spice Co., prefers the old ways and believes farmers need more laborers to improve production.</td></tr>
