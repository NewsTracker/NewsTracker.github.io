<h3>Robert Durst's attorney: Potential new charges may delay extradition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But one of his lawyers said the trip may be delayed by new charges in Louisiana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The heir to a New York real estate fortune shuffled into a New Orleans courtroom with his hands shackled at his waist, wearing sandals and an orange jumpsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He smiled at the gallery, then appeared to fall asleep, and later answered "yes" to a judge's questions about waiving extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Magistrate Harry Cantrell said Durst could now be taken to California, and that he could get pain medication meanwhile after attorney Dick DeGuerin said Durst has had "neurosurgery."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But DeGuerin later said outside court that the trip to California may be delayed because New Orleans prosecutors are considering other unspecified charges against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He wouldn't elaborate, and spokesman Christopher Bowman said the Orleans Parish district attorney's office won't comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>These consequences came only hours after Sunday's finale of an HBO documentary detailing his life of privilege and links to three deaths: his friend in Los Angeles, Susan Berman; his wife in New York, Kathleen Durst; and Morris Black, an elderly neighbor in Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Durst is heard muttering that he "killed them all, of course," at the end of "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Authorities were hoping Monday that this and other evidence will finally lead to a conviction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Durst was arrested without incident by FBI agents on Saturday at a Marriott hotel in New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That's where he had been laying low to avoid the growing attention from the documentary, his longtime lawyer, Chip Lewis, told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It was, by far, not the first time in handcuffs for Durst, who still has millions of dollars despite his estrangement from one of America's wealthiest families, with assets of about $4 billion, made from a New York real estate empire that includes the World Trade Center 1 building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Just last year, he was fined for urinating on the candy racks at a CVS pharmacy in Houston, where he keeps a townhouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Lewis called that an "unfortunate medical mishap" caused in part by Durst's Asperger's syndrome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Former prosecutor Jeanine Pirro believes it was her reopening of the cold case into Kathleen Durst's disappearance that provoked the murder of Berman, who had been Durst's confidante.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And she said Durst's own words can now be used against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the documentary, filmmaker Andrew Jarecki and Durst discuss an anonymous letter that alerted police to a "cadaver" at Berman's address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Durst says only the killer could have sent it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Then Jarecki shows him another letter that Durst had sent to Berman, which one of the slain woman's relatives had recovered and given to the filmmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Durst acknowledges the similar handwriting and misspellings in both letters.</td></tr>
