<tr><td>17</td><td>''I feel that was 14 years ago and this is now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>I did the best that I could at this event, and I really am happy to have put a lot of that behind me,'' she said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>Raonic dropped just one point on his serve in the final game, winning on another backhand error by Nadal, who lost to a Canadian player for the first time in nine career matches.</td></tr>
