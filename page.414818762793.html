<h3>Ukraine says some soldiers taken prisoner in Debaltseve</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ministry said street fighting continued in Debaltseve, which has been the epicenter of fighting in the past two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It did not say how many soldiers had been seized in the ambush.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Ukrainian presidential office earlier Tuesday called on the European Union and NATO to condemn the Russia-backed rebels for violating the cease-fire brokered by European leaders last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Russian news agencies quoted Valery Chaly, chief of the Ukrainian presidential administration, as saying that Kiev wants the EU and NATO to "resolutely condemn" the separatists for violating the deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The war in eastern Ukraine has already killed more than 5,600 people and displaced more than a million, the United Nations said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It has also left the country's industrial heartland in ruins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The government troops and rebels faced a deadline Tuesday to start pulling back heavy weapons from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rebel commander Vladimir Kononov said on Russian television that most of Debaltseve was under their control and urged the Ukrainian troops to surrender.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Their only choice is to leave behind weaponry, lay down arms and surrender," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The announcement by the rebels came after fierce fighting that appeared to be focused on Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both sides in the conflict claim the town is on their side of the cease-fire line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The issue was not resolved under the cease-fire agreement negotiated last week by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Also Tuesday, a deadline passed under the agreement for both sides to begin pulling back weaponry from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The rebels said they were about to begin withdrawing their big guns on some sections of the frontline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A rebel military official, Eduard Basurin, announced in a televised briefing that they "will take the initiative" and begin to pull back heavy weaponry from the frontline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He did not provide a timeline for this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Ukrainian government, however, insisted on a comprehensive cease-fire before pulling back its weaponry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Associated Press reporters saw artillery rounds fired Tuesday from Ukrainian government positions at rebel positions around Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sustained shelling was heard in the area all morning, some coming from Grad rocket launchers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters Tuesday that the separatists continued to attack government positions overnight around Debaltseve and that the pullout hinged on the cease-fire being fully observed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said at least five troops were killed and nine injured in the past 24 hours in the war zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The cease-fire deal, which was brokered by European leaders last week and went into effect early Sunday, specifies the pullout begins on the second day after the parties stop fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This condition has not been met, Lysenko said.</td></tr>
