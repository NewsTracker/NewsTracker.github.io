<tr><td>2</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan's lawyers will return to court next week in their appeal against a decision to throw out their death row challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Their legal team wants to argue President Joko Widodo didn't properly assess their case, including their well-documented rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The State Administrative Court last month wouldn't hear the case on jurisdictional grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They appealed, and the same court on Thursday adjourned until Wednesday, when they will return with supporting evidence including expert witnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lawyers for the state will respond on the following Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Judge Ujang Abdullah set a final hearing for April 1, with a decision to be announced shortly afterwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, Leonard Arpan, said after the hearing they would have to wait until Wednesday to see what evidence their team would bring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Actually their response is not apples to apples with ours," he said, meaning the state hadn't countered all of the issues in the appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Arpan would not discuss what further legal appeals may be planned for the Australians, who are already incarcerated on the island where Indonesia plans to execute them for their role in a 2005 drug smuggling plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Meanwhile Australia's new ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Grigson, on Thursday presented his credentials to Mr Joko at the State Palace in Jakarta.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>Seven of the 10 have appeals of some sort, and the attorney-general plans to execute them simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The executions would take place on Nusakambangan island, Central Java, where Chan and Sukumaran are now jailed in quarantine cells.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Bali Nine pair's case goes back to a Jakarta court today with hopes their cases for clemency can finally be heard.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>The Australians' hopes ride on an appeal in Jakarta administrative court on Thursday against the denial of their clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It was adjourned last Thursday when lawyers for the president had not completed paperwork require to appear.</td></tr>

<tr><td>30</td><td>Some Liberal MPs reportedly are concerned about the government's focus on the Bali Nine members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>West Australian MP Luke Simpkins raised the issue during a party-room meeting on Tuesday, according to the ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He suggested the government had "exhausted all avenues" and needed to shift focus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have visited the death-row prisoners on Indonesia's Nusakamgangan prison and will now have to wait until Monday before they can see them again.</td></tr>

<tr><td>35</td><td>Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso has been granted a judicial review, which typically takes three months and could ensure the Bali Nine pair avoid the firing squad for months, as Jakarta has indicated it prefers to wait for all legal appeals to be heard before killing 10 drug convicts.</td></tr>

<tr><td>37</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's families and friends will visit today before several head home to Sydney because of the delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The pair's lawyers meanwhile are preparing for an appeal in Jakarta administrative court tomorrow against the denial of clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Bob Katter has questioned the decision to fight for the lives of the Bali Nine pair, saying it suggests condescension towards Indonesia.</td></tr>

<tr><td>52</td><td>"The objection is to the manner and tone of the intervention, the warnings and the thinly veiled threats. These are unacceptable. Indonesia does not employ these tactics in its own intervention," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>But Foreign Minister Julie Bishop rejects the allegation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>She said Australia is making its plea for clemency in "the most respectful way possible".</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"We oppose the death penalty at home and abroad and we oppose Indonesia carrying out the death penalty on Australian citizens, that's why we have v respectfully requested President Widodo reconsider the clemency pleas of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan."</td></tr>

<tr><td>63</td><td>He was one of three men convicted of brutally murdering a father and son as they performed the Subuh prayer in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>The Pekanbaru District Court confirmed the granting of clemency, The Jakarta Post reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The move comes as lawyers for Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran continue to bargain for their lives of the convicted drug smugglers.</td></tr>

<h3>Dozens dead in Brazil tour bus crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At least 49 people have been killed after a tour bus plunged hundreds of metres into a densely wooded ravine in southern Brazil, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Among the dead were eight children and 24 women, regional government spokeswoman Ana Paula Keller told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The toll had initially been put at about 30 but the number rose throughout the night as rescuers continued to find bodies at the difficult-to-access crash site in Santa Catarina state, and other victims succumbed to their injuries at a nearby hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The bus plunged 400m into a ravine and ended up on its side, snarled in thick vegetation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rescuers struggled to account for everyone in the failing light and difficult terrain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fifty people were supposed to be on the bus, but authorities believed the number of passengers was higher than that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ten people were in the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Their conditions were not immediately known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The crash site was near a lookout point in the Dona Francisca mountains, a popular stop for tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The bus was operated by a tour firm and was travelling a route of about 300km between Uniao da Vitoria and Guaratuba, on the Santa Catarina coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Witnesses told local press that the driver lost control on the curvy stretch of highway, but the cause was still under investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There are people out there, on the hill, in the bus, trapped in the wreckage. But the chances of finding someone alive are pretty slim," state police Colonel Nelson Coelho said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Several drivers stopped on the roadside to try to help victims as they waited for emergency services to arrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Accidents on this winding road are common.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The O Estado newspaper said 66 people had been killed on the highway in the last five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In 2007, 27 people were killed in a single accident and another crash in 1999 left 35 dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some 43,000 Brazilians are killed in road accidents annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And from 2002-2012, the traffic accident rate surged by over 24 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>With the economy growing and the population topping 200 million, an estimated 10,000 new cars are added to the roads every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>One of the country's last major accidents was in October 2014, when a truck collided with a bus carrying high school students in Sao Paulo, killing 10 and injuring dozens more.</td></tr>
