<h3>Mets pay tribute to slain NYPD officer before game vs. Baltimore; policeman liked Orioles</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK - The New York Mets wore NYPD hats and held a moment of silence before Tuesday night's game against Baltimore to honor a police officer who was shot and killed this week while on duty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Officer Brian Moore died Monday, two days after he tried to stop a man suspected of carrying a handgun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's part of what we think is important and certainly, honoring Officer Moore is important today and so we are wearing them and wearing them with pride," Mets manager Terry Collins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Mets and Orioles lined up for the tribute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police officers stood next to the teams and Moore's picture was shown on the scoreboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 25-year-old Moore was the son, nephew and cousin of police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was a fan of the Orioles, and manager Buck Showalter said the officer's favorite player was slugger Chris Davis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Davis signed a ball and Showalter said the team would autograph an Orioles home jersey for the family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We were going to do a jersey today, but we're going to overnight a white jersey. We thought he and his family would have liked that," Showalter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Showalter said Moore's death "makes you just think about their families and the whole thing, how much those men and women are in harm's way every day for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Mets wrote their regular caps during the game.</td></tr>
