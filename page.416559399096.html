<h3>Ex-president OK'd CIA site, denies knowing what it was for</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) - A former Romanian president has acknowledged approving the CIA's request for a site in Romania, but said he would have refused had he known how it would be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ion Iliescu, president from 2000 to 2004, suggested he believed Romania had hosted CIA "black sites" - prisons outside the U.S. where suspected terrorists were held and subjected to harsh interrogation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Romanian authorities had long denied reports they hosted a CIA secret prison, but Iliescu said last week he approved a request for a site in 2002-2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was widely criticized for his remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Iliescu wrote on this blog Monday that "I would surely have taken another decision" if he had known what the CIA was doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He did not mention the location of the site, its size or whether there was more than one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Associated Press has reported there were CIA black sites at a U.S. air base near the Black Sea port of Constanta and one in Bucharest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Romanian leaders have denied these reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rights groups, European officials and media have reported there were also CIA sites in Poland and Lithuania.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iliescu said Romania "assumed commitments.....in Romania's interests. For all of these there is a cost."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Iliescu denied he had agreed to the CIA's request in exchange for getting U.S. support for Romania joining NATO, which it did in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said speculation that his recent comments served Russian interests was "ridiculous and degrading for Romania."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Polish leaders also denied the existence of CIA sites until the U.S. Senate' Intelligence Committee released a report in December on the CIA's practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Former Prime Minister Leszek Miller and former President Aleksander Kwasniewski admitted they had cooperated with U.S. officials who needed a quiet location to question suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They said that at the time they had no knowledge of abuse taking place there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>By allowing the site, they broke Polish law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A former high-ranking communist, Iliescu was a key figure in the 1989 anti-communist revolt, and was elected president three times, in 1990, 1992 and 2000.</td></tr>
