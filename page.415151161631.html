<h3>Netanyahu: Iran nuclear deal threatens Israel's security</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Seeking to lower tensions, Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. officials cast their dispute over Iran as a family squabble on Monday, even as the Israeli leader claimed President Barack Obama did not - and could not - fully understand his nation's vital security concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"American leaders worry about the security of their country," Netanyahu said as he opened a controversial trip to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Israeli leaders worry about the survival of their country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu's remarks to a friendly crowd at a pro-Israel lobby's annual conference amounted to a warm-up act for his address to Congress Tuesday, an appearance orchestrated by Obama's political opponents and aimed squarely at undermining the White House's high-stakes bid for a nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Netanyahu tried to paper over his personal differences with Obama, insisting he was not in Washington to "disrespect" the president and saying any reports of the demise of U.S.-Israel ties were "not only premature, they're just wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The prime minister's remarks were bracketed by speeches from a pair of top Obama advisers: U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, whose address served as a preemptive rebuttal of Netanyahu's expected critique of the Iran negotiations Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With Secretary of State John Kerry opening a new round of talks with Iran in Switzerland, Rice said the U.S. was seeking a deal that would cut off "every single pathway" Iran has to producing a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She said Obama keeps all options on the table for blocking Tehran's pursuit of a bomb and declared that "a bad deal is worse than no deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Still, Rice warned against holding out for "unachievable" outcomes, such as getting Iran to fully end domestic enrichment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"As desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic or achievable," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If that is our goal, our partners will abandon us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Netanyahu appeared to be reserving his most specific criticism of the negotiations for his remarks to lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But he said he had a "moral obligation to speak up in the face of these dangers while there is still time to avert them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Negotiators are working to reach a framework agreement before an end of March deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Obama spoke dismissively of Netanyahu's warnings about the risks of such a deal, saying the prime minister had previously contended Iran would not abide by an interim agreement signed in 2013 and would get $50 billion in sanctions relief, a figure the U.S. says is far too high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"None of that has come true," Obama said in an interview with Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Obama views the prospect of a nuclear accord with Iran as a central component of his foreign policy legacy - as much as Netanyahu views blocking such a deal as a component of his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Netanyahu has been wary of Obama's diplomatic pursuits with Iran from the start, fearing the U.S. will leave Tehran on the cusp of being able to build a bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As the outlines of a deal have emerged and the deadline has drawn near, his criticism has become more forceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The prime minister has suggested the U.S. and its partners have "given up" on stopping Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In response, Kerry has said America's historic support of Israel suggests Washington deserves the benefit of the doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While Obama and Netanyahu have never gotten along personally, the rift over Iran has sunk their relationship to a new low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The White House has criticized the prime minister's address to Congress as a breach of diplomatic protocol, and officials have publicly questioned his judgment on the merits of the Iran deal.</td></tr>
