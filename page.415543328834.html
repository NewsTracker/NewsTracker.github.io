<h3>Netanyahu secures resounding victory in Israeli election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party scored a resounding victory in Israel's election, final results showed Wednesday, a stunning turnaround after a tight race that had put his lengthy rule in jeopardy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu surged ahead after a last-minute lurch to the right in which he opposed Palestinian statehood and vowed continued settlement construction, setting the stage for fresh confrontations with the White House just weeks after criticizing U.S. talks with Iran in a divisive address to America's Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With nearly all votes counted, Likud appeared to have earned 30 out of parliament's 120 seats and was in a position to build with relative ease a coalition government with its nationalist, religious and ultra-Orthodox Jewish allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed for the past six years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Recent opinion polls indicated he was in trouble, giving chief rival Isaac Herzog's centre-left Zionist Union a slight lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Exit polls Tuesday showed the two sides deadlocked but once the actual results came pouring in early Wednesday, the Zionist Union dropped to just 24 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Given the final results, it is all but assured that Israel's largely ceremonial President Reuven Rivlin will task Netanyahu with forming a new government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Netanyahu says he hopes to do so quickly, within two to three weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Against all odds, we achieved a great victory for the Likud," Netanyahu told supporters at his election night headquarters, declaring victory even before final results were known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I am proud of the people of Israel, who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral, and to insist on what is important."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Turnout in the election was about 72 per cent, more than the last election in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Netanyahu focused his campaign primarily on security issues, while his opponents instead pledged to address the high cost of living and housing crisis while accusing him of being out of touch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Netanyahu will likely look to battle that image now by adding to his government Moshe Kahlon, whose upstart Kulanu party captured 10 seats with a campaign focused almost entirely on bread-and-butter economic issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kahlon is expected to be the next finance minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A union of four largely Arab-backed factions became Israel's third largest party - with 14 seats - and gave Israel's Arab minority significant leverage in parliament for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ten parties in all made it into parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Herzog conceded defeat, saying he called Netanyahu and offered him congratulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He signalled that he would not join forces with Netanyahu and would rather head to the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I think that at this moment what Israel needs most of all is another voice, a voice that offers an alternative and a voice that tells it the truth," he said outside his Tel Aviv home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It must be clear that for the citizens of Israel, the challenges remain the same, the problems are the same. Nothing has changed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Netanyahu's return to power for a fourth term likely spells trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with U.S. President Barack Obama, staked out a series of hard-line positions in the final days of the race that will put him on a collision course with much of the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Polls had Zionist Union party leader Isaac Herzog slightly ahead of Netanyahu in the lead up to the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In a dramatic policy reversal, he said he now opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a key policy goal of the White House and the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He also promised to expand construction in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem, the section of the city claimed by the Palestinians as their capital, where violence has increased in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave no hint of any concern in a tweet congratulating Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Israel has no greater friend than Canada," the tweet said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Palestinians, fed up after years of deadlock with Netanyahu, are now likely to press ahead with their attempts to bring war crimes charges against Israel in the International Criminal Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Now, more than ever, the international community must act," Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The world overwhelmingly supports the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, areas captured by Israel in 1967, and opposes settlement construction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>With the race close, Netanyahu reneged on his previous stated support for a Palestinian state in an attempt to shore up his hawkish base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But peace talks last collapsed nearly a year ago, and it's unclear whether the next government will pursue any drastic policy changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Netanyahu also infuriated the White House earlier this month when he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The speech was arranged with Republican leaders and not co-ordinated with the White House ahead of time in a rare breach of diplomatic protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama was confident strong U.S.-Israeli ties would endure far beyond the election, regardless of the victor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Throughout the campaign, Netanyahu portrayed himself as the only politician capable of confronting Israel's numerous security challenges.</td></tr>

<h3>Wiggins eager to turn heads in Toronto homecoming</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For Andrew Wiggins, the response was to be expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the middle of his first NBA season, with the Rookie of the Year award waiting at the end of this road, Wiggins has been as quiet off the court as he has been impressive on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>So, asked what it would be like to be going home, he just smiled as if to say, "If you only knew."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What he said was: "This is my first time playing back home, in my first NBA season. So it should be exciting."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When the Wolves play the Raptors in Toronto Wednesday night, it will be more than just a homecoming for Wiggins, who grew up in a Toronto suburb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He'll be returning to his home country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And Canada has been waiting for this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Wiggins is the face of Canada's burgeoning basketball scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Anthony Bennett became the first Canadian to go first overall in the draft in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Wiggins, who followed suit last summer, has had far more success on the court than Bennett, his Wolves teammate who will not play Wednesday because of injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So when Wiggins takes the court at the Air Canada Centre Wednesday night, it will be more than exciting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I think it will be a big, big deal," Wolves assistant Sam Mitchell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was head coach of the Raptors from 2004-08, winning coach of the year honors after the 2006-07 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mitchell, who will coach the Wolves Wednesday with Flip Saunders in Ohio with his ailing father, was in Toronto as the basketball groundswell was beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He knows how important Wiggins is in Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"You're talking about the prodigal son," Mitchell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"He's gotten so much hype. Things have changed there. Basketball has grown so fast. Oh, yeah. This is going to be big."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ever since Wiggins came to Minnesota in the summer trade that sent Kevin Love to Cleveland, members of the Canadian media have made their way south to cover Wiggins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Toronto Globe and Mail sent reporters, as has Sportsnet and TSN, which traveled to be at Wiggins' first regular-season game in Memphis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Earlier this month Raptors GM Masai Ujiri, in a speech at the Canadian Basketball Speakers Forum, vowed there would be a Canadian on the Raptors roster during his tenure, then hinted the player he likes most is Wiggins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Both Wiggins and Bennett have purchased at least 50 tickets for this game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Every player has to go through that in their home cities," Saunders said after Monday's game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The biggest pain in the butt is the tickets, trying to make sure you have all your tickets. It's that, more so, than the crowd or anything else."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mitchell said he expects a huge ovation when Wiggins is announced in the starting lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Wiggins, of course, tried to downplay the idea of his being a symbol of Canadian basketball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I would say I'm more of a new face," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I'm the most recent one to be drafted. But there were people before me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Wiggins admits he has been looking forward to this for a while.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"But, once I get on the floor, it's just basketball for me," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Saunders and Wiggins agree the forward is going to Toronto with the fabled rookie wall looming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Before Monday's game Saunders talked about how Wiggins has been trying to battle fatigue.</td></tr>
