<h3>Egypt to demolish headquarters of Mubarak's old party</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The National Democratic Party (NDP) building, a concrete tower block that looms over the River Nile in Cairo, was gutted during the uprising against Mubarak's rule in 2011, and served as a potent symbol of the revolt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Successive governments have discussed plans to knock down the building since the NDP was dissolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some activists who took part in protests have said the headquarters should be preserved as a monument to the uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The statement did not give any reason or timing for the demolition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Since a major economic summit last month in the coastal resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, one side of the building has been covered in a large banner promoting investment in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While Egyptian courts have been gradually absolving Mubarak-era figures, they have been handing down lengthy sentences to liberal and Islamist activists in cases ranging from political protests to acts of violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Earlier this month a court began a retrial of Mubarak, 86, in a case which accused him of diverting public funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was sentenced to three years in jail last May in the case but the conviction was overturned by Egypt's high court in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In November, a court dropped charges against Mubarak of conspiring to kill demonstrators during the uprising, raising fears among rights activists that the old guard was making a comeback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The NDP was dissolved by a court order in April 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It had dominated Egyptian politics since it was founded by Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat, in 1978.</td></tr>
