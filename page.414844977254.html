<h3>Clinton, Warren see opportunity in joining forces</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>have everything to gain and nothing to lose from their secret meeting in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clinton needs to make sure liberals are fully on board with her candidacy ahead of a likely 2016 run for the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Win over Warren, who some Democrats believe could give Clinton a run for her money in a Democratic primary, and Clinton would win over the left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"No question Sen. Warren taps into a wellspring of enthusiasm among a part of the party which will be important in both primary season and [get out the vote] time," said one longtime Clinton ally, who called the meeting "smart and sensible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the same time, Warren has much to gain as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>By tapping into Clinton, the Massachusetts senator can make sure she influences the race for the White House, even if she chooses against being a candidate; she has repeatedly ruled out running for president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Warren also wants to make sure the causes she champions, particularly financial reform, are not given short shrift by the likely Democratic nominee, who is seen as close to Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That sets up a couple of challenges for Clinton, since, the ally said, there are cases where her ideas diverge with Warren's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's a delicate balance, because going too far left risks losing the center. But it's doable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Another ally of Clinton's predicted Warren "won't come cheap," and that the senator inevitably will want something in return, a political maneuver others in Clintonland acknowledge as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They predict Warren will ask for commitments on policies that the senator champions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It remains unclear what Warren really wants out of all of this," another Clinton backer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"But she wants something. I'm sure it's a mix of commitments, including promises to look out for progressive issues and policies. She's no dummy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Progressives who have criticized Clinton and clamored for Warren to enter the race embraced the meeting, calling it "positive news."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"And it will be even more positive news if economic populist thinkers are appointed to her inner circle," said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC) in a statement on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The way for Democrats to win the general election in 2016 is by actively campaigning on an Elizabeth Warren-style economic message - big ideas like expanding Social Security benefits, a national goal of debt-free college and stopping Wall Street banks from wrecking our economy again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Clinton and Warren met at the former first lady's request in December at the Clintons' home in Northwest Washington, The New York Times reported Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Clinton asked for policy ideas and suggestions from Warren, according to the Times, but did not seek an endorsement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Top Democratic officials, bundlers and political strategists said they took the meeting as an indication Warren will not enter the Democratic presidential primary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I think this is Hillary Clinton reaching out to a major player in the Democratic Party, and I think this is something she needs to do if she's going to run the campaign everyone hopes she'll be running," a third Clinton source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Democrats who have spoken to Warren say they haven't been given any real indication that Warren would run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I take her at her word," one Democratic strategist said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Clinton supporters are also confident Warren won't run against their candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I don't think there's anyone who still thinks Warren is running for president, but a lot of people expect this to be an inclusive presidential campaign, and this is a huge part of that," one Clinton ally said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The first longtime ally to the former first lady said that, despite some differences, the two "probably agree on more issues than disagree."</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>, who is also mulling a 2016 presidential run, only has one clear backer from the Sunshine State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I'm with him, I'm all in with him," Diaz-Balart told The Hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I don't think there's anybody more prepared to be president than Jeb Bush."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Like Bush, Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen are supporters of comprehensive immigration reform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Republican operatives say Bush's immigration stance will hurt his chances in the 2016 primary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jolly said, "For me, the experience that Jeb brings is markedly different from the experience of just about anybody else in the field - not just Marco, but anybody else in the field. I'm somebody who appreciates the diversity and length of Bush's experience."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bush called the five Florida members and asked for their support, the lawmakers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ross said Bush also asked him for help in getting other members of the Florida GOP delegation on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>John Mica (R-Fla.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>said he isn't ready to fully commit to a candidate yet, but that Bush is currently his top choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mica added that before he endorses, he's interested in finding out more about Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Bush has been more aggressive than Rubio in reaching out to Florida's Republican lawmakers to ask for their support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>For instance, Rep.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>Bush, 62, late last year announced the formation of a political action committee aimed at exploring a White House run.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>Tom Rooney is the only one who is ready to back Rubio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rooney called the 43-year-old Rubio a "dear friend" and pointed out that they both came into politics at the same time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Even though he also received a call from Bush asking for his support, the congressman said he is looking for a new generation of leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I think that [Marco's] leadership is the kind of transformational leadership that our party really needs right now," Rooney said, but he acknowledged that beating Bush would be a significant challenge for the freshman senator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I think people shouldn't forget that when Marco started running against [former Florida Gov.] Charlie Crist, he was a huge underdog then as well," Rooney continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"He's got his work cut out for him and it's going to be up to him to see whether or not he can climb that mountain, but I believe that he can."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Still, the groundswell of support for Bush underscores the narrative that Rubio can't compete with the former governor for donors and operatives both in their home state of Florida and nationally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Rubio's office declined to comment for this article.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>While the majority of Florida House Republicans are still uncommitted, Bush appears to have the advantage among several who are on the fence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Daniel Webster told The Hill he hasn't heard from Rubio about a potential presidential run but that he talks to Bush frequently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>When The Hill interviewed Webster earlier this month, he said he had a voicemail from Bush and that he hadn't returned the call yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Webster was the state Speaker while Bush was governor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The two politicians and their staff worked together closely back then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Freshman Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Carlos Curbelo said he won't support anyone until the candidates officially announce, but he did note that Bush endorsed him and helped him fundraise when he was locked in a competitive primary contest with four other Republican candidates in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Rubio didn't endorse him until after the primary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Curbelo said he hasn't talked to Bush recently but he has been in contact with Bush staffers and allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Reps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Ted Yoho, Richard Nugent, Bill Posey, Jeff Miller and Curt Clawson all said they remain undecided on 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Reps. Vern Buchanan and Ron DeSantis did not return requests for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Clawson talked at length about his admiration for Bush but said he'll "always remember" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>helping him out when he was "getting pounded" in his primary and special elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Clawson voted for Paul as Speaker of the House last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Bush's deep ties in Florida were mentioned by several lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Crenshaw, who backed Mitt Romney in his 2008 and 2012 bids for the White House, was president of the Florida Senate when Bush was governor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Ross said he and Bush supported each other's failed first campaigns for office in the mid-1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Mica also said he has a "long relationship" with Bush and his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Several Bush backers praised Rubio too, but many also hinted that the 2016 campaign may not be his time just yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"Marco is a star in our party," Jolly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"It's a conflict at times. You have two great potential candidates from our party."</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"I think he's a great future leader on a national level," said Ross.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>"I'm supporting Jeb because I think that in the end, maybe Marco will not be running," Ros-Lehtinen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>"But we'll see. I'm with Jeb and I'm supporting him, but I love Marco too. Divided loyalties. I love them both."</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"It's an embarrassment of riches," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"It's very difficult. I just have a hunch that Jeb is going to stick with it and be there at the finish line, but Marco has a lot of possibilities in front of him."</td></tr>
