<h3>Google working with Levis on smart clothes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO: Google says it's working with iconic US jean maker Levi Strauss to make clothing from specially woven fabric with touch-screen control capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The internet titan used its annual developers conference in San Francisco to reveal its so-called Project Jacquard and to spotlight Levi Strauss as its first partner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Named after a Frenchman who invented a type of loom, Project Jacquard is in the hands of a small Google team called Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP), which is different from the Google (x) lab that develops big-vision innovations such as self-driving cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are enabling interactive textiles," Emre Karagozler of ATAP said as the smart fabric was shown off in an area set up to look like cloth coming out of a loom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We do it by weaving conductive threads into fabric."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The special threads can be woven into a wide array of fabrics, and be made to visually stand out or go unnoticed depending on designers' wishes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Conductivity can be limited to desired parts of fabric or spread across entire cloth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It is stretchable; it is washable," Karagozler said as people controlled lights or computer screens with finger strokes on a blue cloth covering a table in the display area behind him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It is just like normal fabric."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Project Jacquard makes it possible to weave touch and gesture interactivity into any textile using standard, industrial looms, according to Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Anything involving fabric, from suits or dresses to furniture or carpet, could potentially have computer touch-pad style control capabilities woven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Conductive yarn is connected to tiny circuits, no bigger than jacket buttons, with miniaturised electronics that can use algorithms to recognise touches or swipes, ATAP says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The data can be sent wirelessly to smartphones or other devices, enabling actions such as making phone calls or sending messages with brushes of fabric.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"In our hyper-digital world, people constantly struggle to be physically present in their environment while maintaining a digital connection," said Levi Strauss' head of global product innovation Paul Dillinger, who took part in a Google presentation at the gathering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The work that Google and Levi's are embarking upon with Project Jacquard delivers an entirely new value to consumers with apparel that is emotional, aspirational and functional."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Google's Project Ara customisable smartphone is on its way Windows Surface 3 v Apple iPad Air 2: which one should I buy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ten thousand Australians face web blackout Google working with Levis on smart clothes PowerPoint should be banned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This PowerPoint presentation explains why.</td></tr>
