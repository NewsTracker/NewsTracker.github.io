<h3>Apple says App Store, other services resume after three hours</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Customers stand beneath an Apple logo at the Apple store in Grand Central station in New York City, July 21, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(Reuters) - Apple Inc said App Store, Apple Music, iTunes Store and some other services are back online, after a more than three hour outage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The company did not provide details but said only some users were affected on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The last time that Apple services were affected this long was in March, when iTunes and the App Store came back online after a mammoth 12-hour outage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In checks by Reuters on several Apple sites in Asia, Europe and North and South America all issues with the services appeared resolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The problems seemed to have started just before 10 a.m. ET, and the services resumed around 1:15 p.m. ET according to a timeline on Apple's U.S. support page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The problems started just before Apple's radio station Beats 1 was supposed to reveal the nominations for MTV's 2015 Video Music Awards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>MTV announced on Monday that the nominations would be aired exclusively on the station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple Insider, a tech news blog, said the disruption was caused likely by excess traffic associated with the announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are investigating and will update the status as more information becomes available," Apple had said earlier on the support site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple, which is scheduled to report its third-quarter results later on Tuesday, was not immediately available for comment.</td></tr>
