<h3>Apple is joining the Dow Jones index</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple will become one of the 30 corporations that comprise the Dow Jones industrial average, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the company that manages the index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The tech titan - the biggest U.S. company with a market capitalization of nearly $728 billion - will replace AT&T, the telecommunications giant that first joined the Dow in 1916, when there were only 16 companies listed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"As the largest corporation in the world and a leader in technology, Apple is the clear choice for the Dow," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The move, announced Friday and effective March 18, comes as little surprise to Wall Street, which had widely expected Apple to become part of the index after its 7-for-1 stock split last June reduced its share price enough to make it a good fit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple's then-$700 stock price would have overwhelmed the Dow, which is weighted according to a company's share price rather than its market value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple's stock price of around $127 as of Friday will only give it the sixth-biggest weighting, with a 4.3% share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Goldman Sachs currently is the most expensive stock in the Dow, at about $187.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Apple's inclusion in the 116-year-old index gives the Dow - which for most finance pros takes a back seat to the Standard & Poor's 500 as a true market benchmark - a needed shot in the arm, analysts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's high time this happened," Uri Landesman, president of investment management firm Platinum Partners LLC, told the Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"No one can argue that AT&T was more important than Apple, so it seems an important move by a stodgy (index) to look like it's finally catching up to 2015," Landesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The Dow is still the index the public looks at, but its collection of older, blue-chip stocks made it become somewhat dated and synonymous with not being sexy anymore," Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer Fiduciary Trust, told The News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This definitely adds pizazz. They realized they had to do something to make the index more relevant."</td></tr>
