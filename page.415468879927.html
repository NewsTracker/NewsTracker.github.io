<h3>No. 5 Wildcats roll over Ducks 80-52 in Pac-12 title game</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LAS VEGAS (AP) - Through all the success the Arizona Wildcats have had, the regular-season titles, the deep NCAA Tournament runs, they were hounded with one question: When are you going to win the Pac-12 Tournament again?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Finally playing their best under the conference's brightest lights, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>5 Arizona ended 13 years of frustration with a dominating 80-52 win over Oregon in the Pac-12 Tournament championship game Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"When anyone asks when Arizona last won the Pac-12 championship, you tell them 2015," Arizona coach Sean Miller said after accepting the championship trophy from conference Commissioner Larry Scott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Top-seeded Arizona (31-3) won the regular-season title and reached the tournament finale for the second straight year with two convincing wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Wildcats rolled over Oregon in a dominating first half of the championship game, building a 15-point lead with a flurry of 3-pointers and transition baskets in what felt like a home game with so many Arizona fans in the stands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Wildcats let up a little defensively in the second half, but were even better on offense to polish off their first Pac-12 championship since Lute Olson was coach and Luke Walton was tournament MVP in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tournament most outstanding player Brandon Ashley scored 20 points and Stanley Johnson added 14 for Arizona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>T.J. McConnell had 12 points and six assists for the Wildcats, who shot 54 percent and could be in line for a No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>1 seed when the NCAA Tournament bracket is announced on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"For every great team, there comes a point where you really have to come together as a team and we've done a great job of doing that," Ashley said after celebrating under a mammoth shower of confetti at center court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's just the right time; everyone seems to be clicking."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Oregon (25-9) was out of it almost from the start after Arizona went on two big first-half runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Ducks played better offensively in the second half, but had no chances of catching the racing Wildcats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Joseph Young had 19 points Dillon Brooks added 13 and for Oregon, which still should be in good position to get an NCAA Tournament invite on Selection Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The way it ended, everybody hates to lose, but at the same time, this is a young team and we've just got to use it as a learning experience," Young said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Arizona has been in this spot before; the Wildcats were playing in their fourth Pac-12 championship game in Sean Miller's six years as coach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Winning it has been another story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Arizona Pac 12 title drought included a loss to UCLA in the championship game last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Wildcats won the regular-season title and got to this year's championship game by beating California and UCLA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Oregon had a strong finish to the regular season, then beat Colorado and Utah to strengthen its NCAA Tournament chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Arizona rolled over the Ducks twice during the regular season, winning by 18 in Eugene and 24 in Tucson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Wildcats did it to the Ducks again, blowing past them with a 14-0 run in the first half and another 10-0 spurt to lead 36-21 at halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Arizona hit 15 of 31 shots, had eight offensive rebounds and held the Ducks to 7-of-25 shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Wildcats also hounded Young, holding him to seven points - two after a quick flurry to start the game - on 2-of-10 shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Throughout the first half, our shot selection was not good," Oregon coach Dana Altman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"The ball didn't get moved, we took some off-balance ones, some very contested shots. Arizona is a very good defensive team and they got us out of our offensive rhythm for sure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Oregon played better offensively in the second half and Young got untracked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Ducks made 11 of 20 shots and Young confidently stroked in jumpers, scoring 13 in the half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Oregon never put a dent in Arizona's lead, though, because it couldn't stop the Wildcats.</td></tr>

<h3>?Aid workers: At least 8 people dead in Vanuatu cyclone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Packing winds of 168 miles per hour, Cyclone Pam tore through Vanuatu early Saturday, leaving a trail of destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It felt like the world was coming to an end," Alice Clements, Communications Specialist for UNICEF Pacific, told CBS News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The winds were incredibly strong, uplifting roofs, destroying infrastructure like hospitals and schools, obviously affecting housing and we suspect causing significant casualties as well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer in Port Vila, said officials from Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office confirmed to her agency that at least eight people in and around the capital, Port Vila, died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Officials have yet to assess the damage in many of the hard-hit outer islands because communications and power remain cut, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Morrison said she had heard reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A westward change of course put populated areas directly in the path of Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were unconfirmed reports of an additional 44 deaths in Vanuatu's northeastern islands after Pam moved off its expected track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Morrison said residents were awakening to much calmer weather Sunday after many hunkered down in emergency shelters for a second straight night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Many people who have ventured out from 23 emergency shelters around Port Vila have found their homes damaged or blown away altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Morrison said communications have been so problematic that her aid group hasn't yet been able to account for many of its own 76 staff members on the islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For anybody who wasn't in a secure shelter during the cyclone "it would have been a very, very tough time for them," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 spread over 65 islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>About 47,000 people live in the capital, where the U.N. estimated 90 percent of the homes were damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Teetering trees and downed power lines have made parts of Port Vila hazardous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>UNICEF estimated that 54,000 children were among those affected by the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact and scope of the disaster caused by the cyclone wasn't yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We hope the loss of life will be minimal," Ban said at the World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.N. said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who was attending the conference, told participants, "I do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Morrison said the first priority was to ensure people had adequate food, drinking water and shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Beyond that, she said, there would need to be a long and concerted rebuilding effort in the months ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>She said the winds peaked between about midnight Friday and 1 a.m. Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>New Zealand on Saturday pledged 1 million New Zealand dollars ($734,000) to help with relief efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Australia was preparing to send a crisis response team to Vanuatu if needed, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"There are destructive winds, rain, flooding, landslides, sea surges and very rough seas and the storm is exceedingly destructive there," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We are still assessing the situation, but we stand ready to assist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The small island nation, located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, has repeatedly warned it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing resettlement to higher ground and smaller yields on traditional crops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Scientists say it's impossible to attribute single weather events like Cyclone Pam to climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The cyclone has already caused damage to other Pacific islands, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Authorities in New Zealand are preparing for Cyclone Pam, which is forecast to pass north of the country on Sunday and Monday.</td></tr>
