<h3>Donaldson's homer in 10th lifts Blue Jays over Braves 6-5 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Donaldson's drive into the second deck of the left-field stands was his third hit of the afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He hit 29 homers last year with Oakland, was traded to Toronto in the offseason and launched his first two home runs Friday night in an 8-7 loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Donaldson connected on the second pitch from Sugar Ray Marimon (0-1), handing Atlanta its first road defeat of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Toronto reliever Brett Cecil (1-1) picked up the win after working a scoreless 10th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Down 4-0 in the seventh inning after home runs by Freddie Freeman and A.J. Pierzynski, the Blue Jays rallied against Alex Wood with the help of Jose Bautista's third homer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Atlanta's Kelly Johnson hit a solo home run in the ninth that made it 5-all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Toronto starter R.A. Dickey's control issues carried over from his previous outing in last Monday's home opener, when he walked in both two runs in a 2-1 loss to Tampa Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After giving up a first-inning single to Alberto Callaspo, Dickey proceeded to load the bases on back-to-back walks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Chris Johnson had a sacrifice fly before the 32-pitch inning came to an end with a 10-pitch strikeout of Pierzynski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Freeman homered for the second straight day, hitting a two-run shot off the second-deck facade in center field in the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was his fourth home run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pierzynski made it 4-0, connecting in the fourth for his third homer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Blue Jays scored three times in the seventh and chased Wood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez challenged a call that Dalton Pompey had reached first on an infield hit that scored a run with two outs, and the ruling stood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Bautista put Toronto ahead 5-4 with a two-run drive in the eighth off Jim Johnson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Kelly Johnson, formerly of the Blue Jays, tied it with his homer in the ninth off Miguel Castro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Blue Jays: OF Michael Saunders (hamstring) was expected to resume his rehab assignment for Single-A Dunedin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Manager John Gibbons said the earliest he could rejoin the Blue Jays is next weekend in Tampa Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Braves RH Shelby Miller (1-0) faces Daniel Norris (1-0) on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In his second career start in Toronto, Miller will be hoping to replicate last year's success, when he tossed a three-hit shutout as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals.</td></tr>
