<h3>Clinton used private email for State Department business</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington: Hillary Clinton exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state, State Department officials have said, and may have violated federal requirements that officials' correspondence be retained as part of the agency's record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mrs Clinton did not have a government email address during her four-year tenure at the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Her aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as is required by the Federal Records Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A spokesman for Mrs Clinton, Nick Merrill, defended her use of a personal email account and said she has been complying with the "letter and spirit of the rules".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But those who have accused her of concealing key details of the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi which killed four Americans, including the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, are likely to seize upon this controversy involving the woman widely assumed to be the Democratic Party's frontrunner for the 2016 presidential nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was only two months ago, in response to a new State Department effort to comply with federal record-keeping practices, that Mrs Clinton's advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails and decided which ones to turn over to the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>All told, 55,000 pages of emails were given to the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mrs Clinton stepped down from the post of top US diplomat in early 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Her expansive use of the private account was alarming to current and former National Archives and Records Administration officials and government watchdogs, who called it a serious breach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario - short of nuclear winter - where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business," said Jason Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>When Mrs Clinton first took the secretary of state's job in early 2009, Washington was still digesting a major controversy over Bush administration officials using personal email addresses to conduct government business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In June 2007 a congressional oversight committee had asked the Bush administration for emails related to the sacking of US attorneys, allegedly for political reasons, but it turned out the administration had conducted millions of emails' worth of business on private addresses and that the archives had been deleted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Oversight committee chairman Henry Waxman accused the Bush administration of "using non-governmental accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of the communications".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mrs Clinton is not the first government official - or first secretary of state - to use a personal email account on which to conduct official business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But her exclusive use of her private email, for all of her work, appears unusual, Mr Baron said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even the Bush administration officials involved in the attorneys scandal used their official addresses as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I can recall no instance in my time at the National Archives when a high-ranking official at an executive branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business," said Mr Baron, who worked at the agency from 2000 to 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Merrill declined to detail why Mrs Clinton had chosen to conduct State Department business from her personal account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mrs Clinton's successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, has used a government email account since taking over the role, and his correspondence is being preserved contemporaneously as part of State Department records, according to his aides.</td></tr>

<h3>News24.com | Principal sorry for sex abuse at elite Australian school</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>We find out what is causing the behaviour in school children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sydney - A former headmaster at one of Australia's most prestigious private schools on Tuesday apologised after revelations that boys were groomed for sex by paedophile teachers while he was in charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Knox Grammar in Sydney, whose ex-pupils include the late former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and Hollywood star Hugh Jackman, has been the focus in recent days of a national enquiry into institutional responses to child abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The royal commission has heard disturbing claims of abuse at Knox which allegedly happened between the 1970s and 2012, with one ex-student saying the school harboured "a large paedophile cohort".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ian Paterson was the principal for 30 years until 1998 and it is alleged that he failed to tell police about incidents of abuse and provided references for teachers later charged with sex offences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a witness statement to the commission, Paterson admitted he made mistakes and said he was sorry for the pain inflicted on boys under his care at the day and boarding school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I should have known and I should have stopped the events that led to the abuse and its tragic consequences for these boys in my care and their families," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"My abject failure to provide for you a safe and secure place at Knox strikes at the very heart of a responsibility of a headmaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I commend your courage in coming forward," he added, referring to pupils who said they were abused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Knowing that I was your headmaster when much of this abuse occurred is devastating."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Paterson has not been implicated in the abuse of boys under investigation, but the commission on Monday heard evidence that he inappropriately touched a girl on stage during rehearsals for a musical with another school in 1989.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His statement came before he is due to give evidence about his knowledge and management of teachers accused of abusing children while he was in charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Australia opened the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in April 2013, after more than a decade of pressure to investigate claims of paedophilia in religious organisations, schools and state care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The commission's hearings have covered damaging allegations of child abuse involving places of worship, orphanages, community groups and schools dating back decades.</td></tr>
