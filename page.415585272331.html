<h3>No. 11 UCLA stuns No. 6 SMU 60-59 on rare 3-pointer (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>11 seed UCLA stuns No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) -- - Bryce Alford's final jumper appeared offline when he let it fly from behind the 3-point arc, and all the UCLA guard could do was helplessly watch the battle for the rebound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>SMU center Yanick Moreira was in position and seemed to time his leap perfectly as he went up to touch it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The officials, however, thought he was a bit too quick and called goaltending, awarding Alford what turned out to be the game-winning basket with 13 seconds left - one that's sure to be among the most debated of this NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Alford had no doubt it was goaltending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I had a pretty good look at it because I shot it,'' Alford said after the 11th-seeded Bruins' 60-59 South Regional victory over sixth-seeded SMU on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''From my angle, I saw Kevon (Looney) and another player going after it, and I was confused because he went up and grabbed it on its way to the rim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Officials went to the monitor to determine it was a 3 and were resolute in their call, telling a pool reporter that the goaltending call wasn't reviewable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>SMU coach Larry Brown couldn't believe it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''We gave the rule number and the article,'' official Sean Hull said in citing Rule 9.3a 1 and 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Under 2 minutes by rule, we have a directive to do that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Said Moreira, ''I think I hit the rim first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I hit the net or the rim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As replay showed the ball's trajectory, Adams added, ''Again it looks a little bit off to the right, it's touched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>SMU (27-7) still had two shots to win in the final seconds, but Nic Moore, who scored 24 points, missed a 3-pointer and then a 2-point attempt, sending the Bruins (21-13) into a wild celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>For Alford, it capped an amazing 27-point performance that came on nine 3-pointers including four in the final 3:40.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He certainly did his father and UCLA coach Steve Alford proud being a former sharpshooter himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''He leads us in assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He runs the team for us,'' the elder Alford said, ''and in a game like this, where it was so physical and, I thought, two teams that really fought defensively, he had to make some shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''He's always being compared, obviously, because I played the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>UCLA, meanwhile, offered another example that it's better than its record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Bruins, the team many felt didn't even belong in the field of 68, advanced to Saturday's round of 32 against No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>14 UAB, an upset winner over third-seeded Iowa State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>However, the ending of this game had to be seen to be believed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Before Alford's heroics, SMU's Moore seemed destined to hold that distinction after three 3-pointers keyed a 19-0 run over 6 1/2 minutes to put the Mustangs up by nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>UCLA's leading scorer Norman Powell, who had 19 points, broke the run with a layup and added two free throws that were sandwiched between a series of Alford's shots from behind the arc as he finished 9 of 11 there and 9 of 13 overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Bruins' win was a fitting answer for critics of UCLA's record and tournament worthiness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''It was big motivation,'' said Looney, who had six points and 10 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''Everybody doubted us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>They said we should not be here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>SMU's first tournament appearance since 1993 meanwhile ended with some players walking around in disbelief and others pounding the court in frustration and disappointment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The loss also spoiled Hall of Famer Brown's first college postseason since leading Kansas to the 1988 title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That it came against a UCLA program he coached to the 1980 championship game before the Bruins lost to Louisville was even more ironic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''It might have been goaltending,'' Brown said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''It probably was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But we've got all these (TV) cameras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It happened so fast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''But, again, give UCLA credit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>UCLA: The Bruins shot 43 percent from the field including 10 of 20 on 3-pointers and outrebounded the Mustangs 34-33.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>... UCLA won despite 18 turnovers which led to 18 points and closed the final 1:05 on an 8-0 run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>SMU: Markus Kennedy added 16 points and nine rebounds for the Mustangs, who finished at 36 percent from the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>UCLA: Faces UAB on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>SMU: Season ends.</td></tr>
