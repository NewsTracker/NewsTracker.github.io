<h3>Reaction to Boston Marathon bomber's death sentence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"We know all too well that no verdict can heal the souls of those who lost loved ones, nor the minds and bodies of those who suffered life-changing injuries from this cowardly attack. But the ultimate penalty is a fitting punishment for this horrific crime and we hope that the completion of this prosecution will bring some measure of closure to the victims and their families."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Tsarnaev is an unrepentant terrorist held to account by a justice system that provides due process of law even to those who commit the most horrific offenses. We extend our deepest sympathies to all those affected, and hope the conclusion of this trial provides an important measure of justice to those still healing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>- U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I hope this verdict provides a small amount of closure to the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon. We will forever remember and honor those who lost their lives and were affected by those senseless acts of violence on our city. Today, more than ever, we know that Boston is a city of hope, strength and resilience that can overcome any challenge."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I think every time somebody runs the marathon, it will be impossible for this to be too far from their minds. The marathon has certainly changed forever ... and that by definition, I suppose, changes Boston."</td></tr>
