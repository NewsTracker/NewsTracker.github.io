<h3>Watch Amy Schumer's One Direction parody</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When boy bands like One Direction sing that girls "don't know [they're] beautiful," do they really mean it?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Amy Schumer doesn't think so, and did a pitch-perfect parody of those odes asking girls to go to au naturel on Tuesday's episode of "Inside Amy Schumer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In "Girl, You Don't Need Makeup," a quartet of guys urges Schumer to go makeup-free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But when she does...well, let's just say they change their tune on fresh-faced beauty really quickly.</td></tr>
