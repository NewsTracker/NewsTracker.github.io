<h3>S. Leone marks low-key independence day with post-Ebola plan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sierra Leone marked the 54th anniversary of its independence on Monday by setting out a four-point "post-Ebola plan" to put the devastated country on the road to recovery from the deadly epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Almost 4,000 deaths have been registered since the epidemic spread from Guinea a year ago, although health authorities admit the real toll could be significantly higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Today, we cannot celebrate our independence anniversary as we used to, as the nation is in mourning," President Ernest Bai Koroma said in a nationwide televised address to mark the anniversary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The Ebola outbreak has been very tragic for the nation and many of our compatriots have died. Ebola is a war against our very humanity and many of our doctors, nurses and health workers have fallen in the midst of the battle."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Koroma said government strategy would focus on "health, education, social protection and economic recovery through private sector development" to drive the country's rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He added that the government would set aside a national day of "thanksgiving" to honour the victims of the epidemic, which has claimed around 11,000 lives in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The former British colony gained independence as a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth on April 27, 1961, staging elections a month later which saw Sir Milton Margai become its first prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Independence Day, normally a public holiday marked by events throughout the country, began largely unmarked, with no official programme of festivities and its annual civic honours ceremony called off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Freetown was bustling as usual but there were was no sign of celebration, with public gatherings still banned under emergency Ebola laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 3,877 deaths in Sierra Leone, although the country has been making strides in beating the epidemic, reporting just a handful of new cases a week since earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More than 10,000 volunteers have been going door-to-door over the last four days providing vaccinations and other preventative medication to 1.5 million under-fives for measles and other illnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The teams have been screening for malnutrition, providing vitamin A and deworming tablets and carrying out HIV tests on pregnant women and their partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Such basic cost-effective interventions save thousands of lives at the best of times," said Health Minister Abu Bakarr Fofanah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But with the Ebola outbreak, fewer mothers have been taking their children to health facilities to get free treatment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Dennis Marke, of the government's Expanded Programme on Immunisation said an estimated 864 children nationwide were thought to have measles, all but few dozen aged under five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sierra Leone has among the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the world, according to the WHO, but regular vaccination programmes and other healthcare ground to a halt at the height of the crisis.</td></tr>
