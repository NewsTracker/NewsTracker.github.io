<h3>Bali Nine pair await Jakarta's next move</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, who was scheduled to face the firing squad with the Australians, has been granted a judicial review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Supreme Court spokesman, Suhadi, told Kompas newspaper the Filipina's case "could take months".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Judges would be appointed this week and the reviews typically take three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With Jakarta indicating it would prefer to wait all the legal appeals to be heard before killing 10 drug convicts, it means the Bali Nine pair could avoid the firing squad for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However the attorney-general's office says it's also considering taking some prisoners off the execution list pending their appeals, meaning they would execute fewer than 10 in the next round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are awaiting the firing squad in lonely conditions on Nusakambangan island, where Jakarta plans to hold the simultaneous executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The pair's lawyers meanwhile are preparing for an appeal in Jakarta administrative court on Thursday against the denial of clemency.</td></tr>
