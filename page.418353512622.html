<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- The PGA of America is moving its Grand Slam of Golf from Donald Trump's course in Los Angeles, the first significant fallout for golf from the Republican presidential candidate's comments on Mexican immigrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Trump and the PGA of America met Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Both groups said they mutually agreed not to hold the Grand Slam of Golf at Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles on Oct. 19-21.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>''I have great respect for the PGA of America and everything they stand for,'' Trump said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The PGA Grand Slam is a 36-hole exhibition for the four major champions of the year.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>The PGA said it was exploring options on where to move the Grand Slam, along with its annual PGA Junior League Golf Championship that also was to be held at Trump National Los Angeles.</td></tr>
