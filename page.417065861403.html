<h3>CANNES WATCH: Portman says new Israeli isn't political</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Natalie Portman's directorial debut, "A Tale of Love and Darkness," is set around the time of the formation of Israel, but the Oscar-winning actress says it doesn't have a political agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The film, adapted from an autobiographical novel by Amos Oz, premiered over the weekend at the Cannes Film Festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It charts the birth of the state and a boy's initiation into the realities of disappointment and death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think the movie is very much about this very particular, specific family story. Of course, it happens at a crazy moment in history, which I think is a big sort of weight on their backs. It's sort of a pressure cooker for the family, but there's not really a political agenda behind it," said Portman in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"(Amos) Oz became one of Israel's leading peace advocates, so it's not the most controversial, I suppose, of political aspects to the film."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Israeli-born Portman also wrote the screenplay and stars in the Hebrew-language feature as the boy's mother Fania, a cultured and imaginative woman whose dreams can't withstand grinding everyday reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For Portman, making the film in Hebrew was imperative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The language is so important to the story and such an important character," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Someone said to me once, 'Americans always want to make foreign movies and have French characters or Spanish characters speak English, but with a French accent or Spanish accent and it's so silly.' Could you imagine making a movie about George Washington in French and having him have an American accent in French?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Portman's film is playing as a special screening outside of the main competition at Cannes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It's gotten a lukewarm response from critics, but at the premiere, it received a standing ovation.</td></tr>
