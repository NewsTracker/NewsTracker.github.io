<h3>Man planning Boston Marathon-style bombing attack arrested</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Boston Marathon bombers Dzhokhar (left) and Tamerlan Tsarnaev just before their pressure-cooker bombs went off on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boston: A heavily armed Massachusetts man who was building bombs in his apartment and planned to attack a crowded university campus cafeteria on behalf of Islamic State has been arrested, US authorities say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Alexander Ciccolo, 23, was arrested on July 4 for the unlawful receipt of multiple guns, the US Justice Department said in a news release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>His indictment was unsealed on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The university he intended to target was not disclosed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>FBI agents put Mr Ciccolo under surveillance after being alerted to some of his posts on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They watched him buy at least one pressure cooker at a Wal-Mart store in Massachusetts, according to an affidavit by FBI special agent Paul Ambrogio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pressure-cooker bombs were used in the attacks on the Boston Marathon in 2013, killing three and injuring 264 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Ciccolo is accused of being a supporter of Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Ciccolo told an informant he wanted to build bombs similar to the ones used in the attacks on the marathon, according to the affidavit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After his arrest, authorities said they searched his apartment and found partially built bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"These incendiary devices contained what appeared to be shredded Styrofoam soaking in motor oil," Mr Ambrogio said in his affidavit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Ciccolo allegedly said the Styrofoam would cause the fire from the exploded devices to stick to people's skin and make it harder to put the fire out, according to the affidavit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Ciccolo was arrested after taking delivery of two Glock handguns, a Colt AR-15 rifle and a SigArms high-powered rifle, according to authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After his arrest while at the Franklin County House of Correction, Mr Ciccolo is accused of stabbing a nurse in the head with a pen.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>It did not immediately know whether Mr Ciccolo had an attorney.</td></tr>
