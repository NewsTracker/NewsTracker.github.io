<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu tiptoes through diplomatic minefield in Washington ahead of speech</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington: Having provoked a diplomatic row with the Obama administration, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told an audience of thousands in Washington, DC, that the relationship between the two nations would grow and strengthen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Our friendship will weather the current disagreement to grow even stronger in the future," he said in an address to the annual conference of the America Israel Political Action Committee on Monday morning, the eve of his controversial address to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Netanyahu said that while American leaders worry about their nation's security, Israel's feared for their nation's survival, and this differing point of view had lead to disagreements between the two nations in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives his speech in Washington on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he said America's and Israel's shared values were stronger than their divisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In a dark, and savage, and desperate Middle East, Israel is a beacon of humanity, of light, and of hope," he said, in a speech often interrupted by the applause of an audience that represented some of the most powerful in America on both sides of politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Israel and the United States will continue to stand together because America and Israel are more than friends. We're like a family."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>US President Barack Obama will not meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on his visit to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's speech to Congress has caused profound concern to many, including champions of the alliance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Netanyahu was invited to address Congress by the Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, who broke convention by not informing the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the US system the president is granted sole authority over foreign affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Netanyahu is expected to use the speech as part of his effort to derail negotiations between leading nations and Iran over its nuclear program, one of the administration's highest priorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While the negotiating parties - the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany - appear willing to allow Iran to maintain some peaceful nuclear capacity, Mr Netanyahu wants to see their entire nuclear program dismantled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The speech is being given just a fortnight before the Israeli elections, leading many to speculate that Mr Netanyahu is risking his nation's most crucial alliance for domestic political gain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Obama will not meet with Mr Netanyahu, and around 30 Democratic representatives from Congress have said they will not attend the speech, including the Vice President, Joe Biden, who also serves as President Pro Tem, or president of the Senate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's forcing people who are otherwise pro-Israel to have to decide between sitting there and seeming to endorse Bibi's [Mr Netanyahu]'s case or boycotting the speech and getting smacked around politically," one angry member of Congress told Foreign Policy magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Last week Mr Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, told an interviewer, "What has happened over the last several weeks - by virtue of the invitation that was issued by the speaker and the acceptance of it by Prime Minister Netanyahu two weeks in advance of his election - is that on both sides, there has now been injected a degree of partisanship," Ms Rice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's destructive [to] the fabric of the relationship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In response over the weekend the controversial reality TV figure and failed Republican candidate Rabbi Schmuley Boteach, took out a full page advertisement depicting Ms Rice surrounded by skulls and declaring she was blind to genocide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>American Jewish groups almost unanimously condemned the ad in harsh terms, calling it "revolting," "grotesque," "spurious and perverse," "outrageous," "abhorrent," and a "sinister slur."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Marshall Wittman, a spokesman for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, "Ad hominem attacks should have no place in our discourse."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Concern has not been limited to the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A group representing senior Israel Defense Forces officers said the planned speech constituted a threat to Israel's safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The way to prevent a nuclear Iran is by strengthening the alliance between the countries, between the US and Israel, and between Israel and the international community," said Major General (reserve) Amnon Reshef, head of the group called Commanders for Israel's Security, during a press conference in Israel on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It's already impossible to conceal the rift with the Americans, and it's impossible to accept such a rift. We believe that this constitutes a clear and present danger to Israel's security."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Addressing AIPAC on Monday morning Mr Netanyahu appeared conciliatory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Let me clarify what is not the purpose of that speech. My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the esteemed office that he holds. I have great respect for both," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I deeply appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel - security cooperation, intelligence sharing, support at the UN, and much more. Some things that I, as prime minister of Israel, cannot even divulge to you because it remains in the realm of the confidences that are kept between an American president and an Israeli prime minister."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Speaking to the conference after him, America's ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, also reaffirmed the friendship between the two nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>She lamented the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe and attacks on Israel in the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"It is a false choice to tell Israel that it has to choose between peace on the one hand, and security on the other. The United Nations would not ask any other country to make that choice, and it should not ask it of Israel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But she also noted, "Our commitments to our partnership with Israel are bedrock commitments, rooted in shared fundamental values, cemented through decades of bipartisan reinforcement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Ms Rice is expected to address the conference on Monday evening in Washington, DC.</td></tr>

<h3>Massachusetts delegation divided on Netanyahu speech</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two House members - Reps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Katherine Clark and James McGovern - are opting out of attending Tuesday's speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sen. Elizabeth Warren also said in a statement to The Boston Globe that she won't attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>McGovern said he is a strong supporter of Israel but called the timing and circumstances of the speech deeply troubling, noting that it comes before an Israeli election and during nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"For Speaker Boehner to use our relationship with Israel to score partisan political points is wrong," McGovern said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The House chamber should not be used as a platform for a foreign leader to run his re-election campaign."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clark said she's committed to maintaining and strengthening what she called the special relationship between the U.S. and Israel, but noted the invitation was offered without first consulting the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This invitation came without consulting the president or State Department and with the false representation that it was a bipartisan invitation," Clark said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Speaker Boehner has poisoned a critical foreign policy discussion with partisan gamesmanship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Warren also said she remains a strong supporter of Israel and is "deeply concerned about the prospect of an Iranian nuclear weapon," which she said she discussed with Netanyahu in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's unfortunate that Speaker Boehner's actions on the eve of a national election in Israel have made Tuesday's event more political and less helpful for addressing the critical issue of nuclear nonproliferation and the safety of our most important ally in the Middle East," Warren said in the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Other members - including Reps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Niki Tsongas, Seth Moulton, Michael Capuano, and Joe Kennedy - said they're planning to attend even though they don't support how Speaker John Boehner set up the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tsongas said Israel remains the country's strongest ally in the region, but said she was disappointed with what Democrats have portrayed as Boehner's snubbing of the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I plan on attending Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech but remain disappointed that Speaker Boehner chose to ignore normal protocol that has turned the visit into a partisan issue and distracted attention from critical issues of mutual concern," Tsongas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Capuano said he's disappointed "Speaker Boehner would choose to politicize a relationship with such an important ally by not consulting with the president before issuing the invitation to address Congress."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Other members planning to attend include Sen. Edward Markey and Reps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Stephen Lynch, Richard Neal and William Keating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Netanyahu's already tense relationship with President Barack Obama has reached a new low as a result of the planned speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Israeli leader is deeply suspicious of Obama's efforts to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran, fearing the U.S. and its negotiating partners are prepared to leave Tehran on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Netanyahu stressed he would speak clearly before Congress about the threat a nuclear Iran would pose to Israel and the world.</td></tr>
