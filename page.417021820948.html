<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA president Sepp Blatter to visit U.S. in 2016, rejects talk of avoiding FBI Sepp Blatter says he has no fear of setting foot in the United States - no matter what the FBI might be doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ZURICH (AP) - Sepp Blatter says he has no fear of setting foot in the United States - no matter what the FBI might be doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The FIFA president insisted Friday he is not avoiding the U.S. despite a reported probe implicating two of his former FIFA colleagues in financial corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In fact, Blatter plans an American visit in June 2016 for the Copa America tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I will be there if elected," said Blatter, who is widely expected to win another term in the FIFA presidential vote on May 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Even if not elected, they will invite me I am sure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Just two weeks before the election that would extend his 17-year reign in world soccer's top job, Blatter is pursuing a low-key campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Blatter talked about his latest soccer peacemaking mission to Israel and the Palestinian territories; hinted at changing how nations qualify to play in and bid to host the World Cup; and sent a letter to 209 voting federations explaining his priorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The single page document - including the slogan "Develop the game, touch the world and build a better future" - is as near as Blatter has come to a campaign manifesto for a fifth presidential term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fighting discrimination and match-fixing and helping professional clubs would be key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Still, three days after ESPN aired a documentary profile of him, Blatter was pressed on a central claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He denied avoiding the United States amid reports that the FBI is investigating former leaders of CONCACAF, the U.S.-based regional soccer body which gets millions of dollars each year from FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Blatter said he was aware that Jack Warner of Trinidad and Tobago and Chuck Blazer of the United States, both one-time FIFA executive committee members, were under scrutiny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I know, and this everybody knows, that in the U.S. there is an investigation against former people (that) have been in my government," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"But it is nothing against me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Blatter visited the U.S. in May 2011 for a CONCACAF meeting in Miami and returned weeks later for a Gold Cup semifinal match in Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>ESPN claimed he has purposely stayed away since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On Friday, Blatter said he "can go there" and noted there are international channels for authorities "if they want to speak with me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But his next visit to the U.S. could be for the centenary Copa America, the South American championship being hosted next year as a one-off by the U.S. Soccer Federation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The U.S. also hopes to stage the 2026 World Cup and got a boost Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Blatter said FIFA's executive committee could pass new rules this month that would block a continent that hosts the World Cup from bidding for the next two editions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>With Russia staging the 2018 tournament, Europe would then be ineligible to host the World Cup again until 2030.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"It should be this way," Blatter said Friday, adding that the proposal is "more than an option."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Americans could compete against CONCACAF neighbors Canada and Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>African countries could also join, and Morocco has expressed interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>FIFA will choose the 2026 host in a May 2017 vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It will be the first since December 2010 when a controversial 2018-2022 joint process chose Russia and Qatar, which edged the U.S. in a final round of voting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The executive committee meets on May 24-25 and again May 30 to confirm the allocation of 2018 World Cup qualifying slots open to each continent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Blatter has long encouraged smaller regions to seek more places, potentially taking spots from Europe's 13 qualifying slots in the 32-team lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>On Friday, Blatter hinted at expanding the intercontinental playoffs, which currently do not involve European or African teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"That is a good idea and you are not so far away," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"This gives a little bit more incentive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>His latest presidential term, which began in turmoil amid a bribery scandal that removed his intended Qatari opponent, is nearing an end with Blatter seeking to calm tensions between the Israeli and Palestinian soccer federations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Israeli security restrictions limiting movement of Palestinian players, visiting teams and soccer equipment has led to a proposal to suspend Israel from FIFA at the May 29 meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Blatter said he will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"(Netanyahu) would not receive the FIFA delegation if he would not be ready to make concessions. I am sure of it," said Blatter, who will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Blatter opposes the suspension vote, saying Israel did not break FIFA statutes in a political issue outside soccer's control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Aged 79, he did not commit to leaving FIFA in 2019.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"I feel good now, but you never know. But first, let me be elected," said Blatter, who was then asked if a decisive 140-plus first-round vote tally was possible.</td></tr>
