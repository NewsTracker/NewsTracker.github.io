<h3>Nintendo shares marked up 21% smartphone gaming plan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Traders pounced with buy offers overwhelming sell offers, sending the putative asking price up 21.3 percent on Tuesday's close to 17,080.0 yen -- hitting the daily stop limit of 3,000 yen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The broader market was flat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nintendo, based in the ancient city of Kyoto, announced Tuesday it was teaming up with Tokyo-based mobile gaming company DeNA to develop games for smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The maker of the Super Mario and Pokemon franchises plans to buy 10 percent of DeNA for 22 billion yen ($181 million) with the pair set to create games based on Nintendo's host of popular characters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Investors had been hoping Nintendo would venture into the expanding market but the company has -- until now -- stuck with a "consoles-only" policy, noted Kenji Shiomura, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Now they are finally stirring and... the market likes it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Even with Wednesday's stellar gains, Nintendo's stock is still a long way off where it once was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The issue had lost around 70 percent since June 2007 when Apple's iPhone made its debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Finally Nintendo has turned a corner and embraced a huge strategic shift," Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC in Singapore, said in a report, as he raised his recommendation on the stock to "buy".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We have been waiting for Nintendo to make this move and this will offer large upside."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>DeNA was also poised to rise by the daily limit in Tokyo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Shares in the Bank of Kyoto, the fifth-largest investor in Nintendo, surged 15.47 percent to 1,433 yen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nintendo and DeNA did not release any details about which characters would be made available to play on smartphones or tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But Nintendo's president Satoru Iwata said the two companies will launch at least one game this year, and added that the tie-up would help tap a new customer base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The world is changing, so any company that is not coping with the change will fall into decline," he told a Tokyo news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Iwata added that the announcement did not mark a move away from consoles, saying Nintendo would release a new system as a successor to its Wii U home console, which came on to the market in late 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nintendo has struggled as rivals Sony and Microsoft outpaced it in console sales by embracing hard-core gamers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But all three have suffered at the hands of a trend toward cheap -- or sometimes free -- downloadable games for smartphones and other mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sony on Tuesday said its net profit for the three months to December more than tripled from a year earlier, while confirming it was on course to incur an annual loss smaller than expected last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Robust PlayStation console businesses helped improve Sony's earnings along with a weak yen, increased sales of smartphones, and image sensors for cameras, Sony said.</td></tr>
