<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Haltern Am See, Germany: It had to have been one of the happiest experiences of their lives, people said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>A few hours later, the French authorities were declaring everyone on board dead, though in the dark and cold the search was called off before the bodies were recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It was a Spanish language exchange program and they were flying home after having what was probably the most wonderful time of their lives," said Sylvia Loehrmann, the education minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's so tragic, so sad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Debris scattered over the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes in the French Alps on Tuesday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>On Tuesday morning they departed the small Catalan town of Llinars del Valles on the 6 o'clock train, bound for the airport in nearby Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>During their stay, the German students had not only spent time around Llinars del Valles but also made several trips to Barcelona, which is about a half-hour away by train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Pere Grivre, a town official, said in a telephone interview that he had seen the students.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>"Everybody here is in complete shock."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Students and well wishers remember their friends at Joseph-Koenig Gymnasium secondary school in Haltern am See, Germany on March 24, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>In Haltern am See, a community of 38,000 in the flat countryside of western Germany, many people knew or were related to the families of the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>During this time of year, tens of thousands of students just like them, all over the world, board planes for a week or two of foreign culture.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>She stood with a classmate, Christopher, also 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They said they did not know the victims well, but knew their faces, as they know almost all the faces in the school, which has only a few hundred students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"This is the darkest day in the history of our city," Bodo Klimpel, the mayor of Haltern am See, told reporters, his voice choking in the struggle to hold back tears.</td></tr>

<tr><td>28</td><td>A friend of the German students from the crashed plane, wipes away tears during a mass in Llinars del Valles, near Barcelona, Spain, Tuesday, March 24, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Joseph-Koenig school planned to open on Wednesday morning, Klimpel said, but instead of regular classes, students and teachers would gather in the auditorium to begin working through their grief together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That work had already begun Tuesday evening, when people packed the cavernous St Sixtus Roman Catholic Church in the center of town, listening in silence as organ music played mournfully as people lined up to accept communion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Outside, a teenage girl sobbed uncontrollably, comforted by two adults, who held her hands as they gently led her away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The church had opened its doors in the early afternoon, with social workers and psychologists providing extra assistance.</td></tr>

<tr><td>36</td><td>Her husband, a bus driver, had often driven the two teachers who were on the plane, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"I just can't understand it," Ivonne Bobb said outside the school, where she had just placed a candle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Haltern is small. I just can't grasp it."</td></tr>
