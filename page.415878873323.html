<h3>Bangladesh police charge four men with murder of blogger Washiqur Rahman</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police in Bangladesh have charged four men with the murder of a blogger accused of mocking Islam, the second such attack in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Washiqur Rahman was hacked to death near his home in Dhaka on Monday, less than two months after an American atheist blogger died after a similar assault in the capital of the developing south Asian country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police said three knife-wielding attackers killed Rahman, 27, because they believed he had defamed Islam through his writings on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Preliminary murder charges have been lodged against two men - both students at Islamic religious schools, who were arrested at the scene after being overpowered by bystanders - and against a third assailant who fled and has yet to be found, an officer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An alleged plotter of the attack was also charged and is under investigation after being named during police questioning, said deputy commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"A case was filed against the four people, accusing them of the murder of the blogger," Sarker told Agence France-Presse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Bangladesh is officially secular but has seen a rise in extremist Islamic ideologies in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The mainly Muslim country of more than 160 million people, which won its independence from Pakistan after a brutal civil war in 1971, has long struggled to resolve profound disagreements over the role of religion in politics and society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bloggers, other writers and secular activists held a rally and candlelight vigil for Rahman late on Monday at Dhaka University, seen as a local bastion of secularism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The EU, Bangladesh's main trade partner, condemned the "vile aggression".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Campaign groups have accused authorities of failing to protect freedom of expression in Bangladesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The killing of Washiqur Rahman is a another clear example of the Bangladeshi government's utter failure to ensure the safety of those at risk. How many more bloggers will have to be attacked before action is taken?" asked Abbas Faiz, Amnesty International's Bangladesh researcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The murder of American Avijit Roy, who was hacked to death with machetes in Dhaka in February, prompted uproar, with hundreds of secular activists holding protests for days to demand justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>One of the two men arrested over the latest murder had been studying at a well-known religious school in Chittagong, which had links to the hardline Islamic group Hefazat-e-Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The group spearheaded huge protests against secular bloggers in 2013 that left nearly 50 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Police cracked down on the thousands of hardliners who poured into Dhaka to demand their execution for defaming Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In 2004, assailants attacked the Bangladeshi writer Humayun Azad, also with machetes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Azad survived the attack, but died in mysterious circumstances later that year in Germany, where he had gone on an academic visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Rahman, the victim of the latest attack, wrote a 52-episode series for an anti-religion satirical site called Dhormockery.com, according to the London-based International Humanist and Ethical Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The pieces mock aspects of Islam and fellow bloggers said Rahman did not believe in any organised religion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"He used to write a satirical column on Facebook against believers. He was an atheist. His killing has to be connected to his writing," Tamanna Setu, a friend, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Political violence in Bangladesh has claimed the lives of more than 100 people and left hundreds more injured in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Clashes have pitted activists from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP), which boycotted general elections a year ago, and other parties against security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The latest protests have been called by Khaleda Zia, the BNP leader, who wants the country's prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, to resign and call fresh polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Hasina has said her government will remain in office until her term ends in 2019.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Allies of the BNP include Islamist parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Reporters Without Borders rated Bangladesh 146th among 180 countries in a ranking of press freedom last year.</td></tr>
