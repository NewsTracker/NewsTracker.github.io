<h3>Robo-Advisors Will Dominate The Investment Management Industry</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The benefits will accrue to self-directed investors and savvy financial advisors who leverage the technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Today robo-advisors are turn-key investment platforms employing algorithms based on modern portfolio theory to construct and manage portfolios.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A critical competitive advantage robo-advisors have over flesh and blood advisors is that, for the most part, they are significantly less costly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For a select and growing cohort or tech-comfortable investors - individuals and institutions - these platforms, as they continue to increase their functionality, will become the principal if not exclusive way they will invest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This will be a relatively slow incremental process as decision-making authority shifts from many of the "old guard" and their entrenched way of doing things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is with the shrewd, astute financial advisors that the robo-advisor revolution will move fairly quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Presently, among financial advisors catering to individuals, awareness of robo-advisors is in the early stages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Moreover, these technology platforms are just now being rolled out to enable financial advisors to use them on behalf of their clients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>What is very likely to occur is that a sizable percentage of financial advisors will begin to incorporate robo-advisors into their practices enabling them to utilize their time more efficaciously as well as concentrate on providing a broader range of financial solutions to their clients while mitigating costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The reason robo-advisors will dominate the investment management industry is that investors are focused on results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The ability of robo-advisors both as stand-alone complexes for self-directed investors and as resources for financial advisors to deliver results comparable to what is otherwise available will be the determining factor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Consequently, the technology will, in time, be ubiquitous in the investment management industry as performance will be on par with most investment advisory alternatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As robo-advisors evolve by incorporating cognitive computing capabilities coupled with simpler user interfaces, the use of these technology platforms will greatly expand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The result will be an increasing cohort of self-directed investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The evolution of robo-advisors will also result in a dramatic bifurcation of financial advisors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There will be a relatively small but exceedingly profitable group of financial advisors and those that will be taking on a diminished role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Will Your Next Investment Advisor Be An App?</td></tr>
