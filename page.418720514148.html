<h3>Apple Watch might be a success after all</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>APPLE has hinted its two-and-a-bit-month-old Apple Watch is already a $1billion business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts the possibilities for the firm's Apple Watch were "enormous".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He also hinted that the Apple Watch was a business worth more than $1billion - despite only being on-sale in nine countries for some 90 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple Watch has also had a more successful launch than either the hugely popular iPhone and iPad, Mr Cook hinted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The news comes days after a technology research firm revealed Apple Watch owners were more satisfied with the device than those who bought a first-generation iPhone and iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Speaking during the Q&A session at the end of the third quarter results, CEO Tim Cook told analysts: "Sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"To give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact, the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I know I never go anywhere without the Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Now, our objective of the quarter wasn't primarily sales but also how we position the product in the long term because we are starting a new product category.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"And as I back up and look at this, with 8,500 apps, we've already announced the next watchOS 2 - It will bring native apps, which will be killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Even though the store layout was delayed, we've learned a lot about the buying experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We plan to expand channel before the holiday because we're convinced that the watch will be one of the top gifts of the holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I know I never go anywhere without the Watch. And it's not because I'm the CEO of Apple, I'm that attached to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I get a lot of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way. And so that's how I look at the Watch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Apple is not planning to break out individual Apple Watch figures any time soon, however Tim Cook's comments seem to hint that earlier reports of Apple Watch orders dropping 90 per cent were inaccurate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Instead the firm's first wearable is being included in the Other category in its report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This category also includes sales of the Apple TV, iPod, Beats Electronics, Apple accessories and cases and Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>During its latest quarter, the Cupertino company reported an increase of revenue to $2.6 billion - up some 56 per cent sequentially.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However this growth cannot be solely attributed to the Apple Watch, since other products within the category could have grown or dropped within the same three-month period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>CEO Tim Cook himself hinted that the Apple Watch generated more revenue than the 56 per cent - or $1billion - increase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"If you look at Other products category, and look at the revenue in here, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change, or the year over year change and assume that was just Watch revenue," he told analysts yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Because the aggregate balance of that category, both sequentially and year-over-year, is shrinking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Obviously the iPod is part of that but there are other things in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The release of watchOS 2.0 alongside iOS 9 in late September promises to allay the major complaints with the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The updated operating system will bring "native" apps - rather than Bluetooth-linked extensions of iPhone apps - including a number of apps which work without the phone nearby, including games, audio recorders and tools that analyse golf swings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Apple also needs to ensure that there are must-have apps amongst the 8,500 apps currently available for the Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>However - 89 days into the products lifecycle there is plenty of time for Apple to iterate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It might be hard to remember, but the first iPhone in 2007 was just a little more than a phone with a multi-touch display.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Third-party apps did not launch until the following year and even then most early software in the App Store was a dumbed-down web app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Apple only had 500 apps within its iOS App Store when it launched in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Now, it has more than a million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Now many apps - for example, Instagram - can do more within the iOS app than is possible in the online version of the service.</td></tr>
