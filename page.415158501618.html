<h3>'That's my son!': Jihadi John's mother screams watching Islamic State video</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The mother of Mohammed Emwazi knew he was Jihadi John and screamed "that's my son" when he first appeared in an Islamic State video - but it is believed she failed to tip off the authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ghania Emwazi recognised her son's voice as the masked, knife-wielding killer in the video showing the beheading of American James Foley last August - the first Western hostage to be murdered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>American journalist James Foley was beheaded by Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mrs Emwazi screamed at the television when she saw the hooded figure ranting before appearing to murder Mr Foley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After watching the video a second time, Emwazi's father Jassem was also sure it was his son, Kuwaiti investigators disclosed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There is no evidence the parents went to the police or security services to alert them and it was not until September that officials began to suspect he was the world's most wanted man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police officers near the home of Islamic State militant Mohammed Emwazi, popularly known as Jihadi John.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His identity was made public last week although he has still not been officially confirmed as the man responsible for the murder of at least five Western hostages, including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Emwazi family are in hiding in Kuwait, after returning there from the UK, and have been questioned by the security services there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It is believed the parents came to the UK in the 90s as asylum seekers because they were accused of being supporters of Saddam Hussein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Emwazi was questioned along with one of his sons for most of the day on Sunday after being summoned by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Unmasked: Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The mother recognised the voice and she screamed 'that is my son' while he was talking before beheading the first American hostage," a source familiar with the Kuwaiti investigation said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"When they played the video again, the father was sure it was his son."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Insiders described Mr Emwazi as "emotional and upset at what had happened to his son" while talking to investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I am waiting day-by-day to hear about his death," he is said to have told his interrogators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Emwazi - who now lives in al-Oyoun, a neighbourhood near Taima, about 20 miles outside Kuwait City - said he last had contact with his son in 2013, shortly before he travelled to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The murderer is said to have told his parents that he planned to move to Syria to "deliver aid".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The father, who holds British citizenship like his son, is understood to be employed by a Co-op supermarket in Kuwait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But workers there said he only showed up every six months in order to renew his Kuwaiti residence permit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Most members of the family are believed to have moved back to Kuwait, where police kept them under close surveillance following the recent revelations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Emwazi snr is said to have been a Kuwaiti police officer himself, having served from 1980 until 1993.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He has been reported by some sources to have left Kuwait after collaborating with Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces after they invaded Kuwait in 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He gained British citizenship in 2002 and moved back to Kuwait the following year, according to sources.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>Many live in impoverished sprawling neighbourhoods in Taima in ramshackle houses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That setting contrasted sharply with the upmarket neighbourhood of al-Samiya in Kuwait City where Mohammed Emwazi worked as a trainee IT salesman for three months in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Office space rents for up to AU$12,800 per square metre in the area.</td></tr>
