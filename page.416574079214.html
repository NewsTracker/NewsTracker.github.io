<h3>Nepalese troops ready aid for helicopters to carry to remote villages near quake epicenter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GORKHA, Nepal - Preparing to make a push into the most isolated parts of quake-devastated Nepal, soldiers on Tuesday were readying food, water and other emergency supplies to be loaded onto helicopters in this small town near the earthquake's epicenter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gorkha, which would barely count as a village in much of the world, is the district's administrative, transport and trading center for surrounding tiny villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was being used as a staging post to get rescuers and supplies to those remote communities, some of which are believed to be nearly completely destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The death toll from Saturday's magnitude-7.8 quake rose past 4,400, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"In the rural areas, 90 percent of the people have been affected by this calamity," district official Surya Mohan Adhikari said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They have lost their homes and livestock, they have no way of getting food."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It is very difficult to reach them," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"They are cut off by road slides on the mountain roads, and the wind and rain is making it difficult for helicopters to land."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nepal was facing a humanitarian crisis as tens of thousands rendered homeless by the earthquake are living in the open without clean water or sanitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Chaos reigned back at Kathmandu's small airport, with the onslaught of relief flights creating major backups on the tarmac.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Four Indian air force aircraft carrying communication gear, aid supplies and rescue personnel were forced to return to New Delhi Monday because of airport congestion, tweeted Sitanshu Kar, India's defense ministry spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The United Nations says it was releasing $15 million from its central emergency response fund for quake victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The funds will allow international humanitarian groups to scale up operations and provide shelter, water, medical supplies and logistical services, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Trucks carrying food were on their way to affected districts outside the hard-hit and densely-populated Kathmandu valley, and distribution of the food was expected to start Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Citing government figures, Haq said an estimated 8 million people have been affected by the quake in 39 of Npael's districts, and more than 1.4 million need food assistance, including 750,000 who live near the epicenter in poor quality housing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The U.N. humanitarian country team for Nepal is coordinating international relief efforts with the government and a clearer picture of needs should emerge within the next 48 hours, Haq said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The immediate priority is search and rescue, and removing debris to find survivors still trapped, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Buildings in parts of the capital, Kathmandu, were reduced to rubble, and there were shortages of food, fuel, electricity and shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As bodies were recovered, relatives cremated the dead along the Bagmati River, and at least a dozen pyres burned late into the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Conditions were far worse in the countryside, with rescue workers still struggling to reach mountain villages three days after the earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Some roads and trails to the Gorkha district were blocked by landslides - but also by traffic jams that regularly clog the route north of Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>World Vision aid worker Matt Darvas arrived in the district Monday afternoon and said almost no assistance had reached there ahead of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Newer concrete buildings were intact, Darvas said, but some villages were reported to be devastated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He cited a "disturbing" report from the village of Singla, where up to 75 percent of the buildings may have collapsed and there has been no contact since Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Timalsina said 223 people had been confirmed dead in Gorkha district but he presumed "the number would go up because there are thousands who are injured."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He said his district had not received enough help from the central government, but Jagdish Pokhrel, a clearly exhausted army spokesman, said nearly the entire 100,000-soldier army was involved in rescue operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We have 90 percent of the army out there working on search and rescue," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We are focusing our efforts on that, on saving lives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The country's death toll rose to 4,352, said Deputy Inspector General of Police Komal Singh Bam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Another 61 were killed in neighboring India, and China's official Xinhua News Agency reported 25 dead in Tibet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>At least 18 of the dead were killed at Mount Everest as the quake unleashed an avalanche that buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers preparing to make their summit attempts.</td></tr>
