<h3>Sepp Blatter makes special mention of his Oceania support</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA president Sepp Blatter after his election as President at the Hallenstadion in Zurich, Switzerland, Friday, May 29, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blatter has been re-elected as FIFA president for a fifth term, chosen to lead world soccer despite separate U.S. and Swiss criminal investigations into corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 209 FIFA member federations gave the 79-year-old Blatter another four-year term on Friday after Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan conceded defeat after losing 133-73 in the first round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sepp Blatter had no sooner been returned as president of FIFA during a controversy-filled week when he took time Friday to thank his friends in the most remote and smallest of the six international football confederations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We need more respect for the Oceanian confederation," Blatter said not long after winning election for a fifth term at the Zurich congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And the 79-year-old Blatter made another reference to the 11 voting members of the Oceania group spread across the South Pacific.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It came during a tumultuous week for Blatter after police, acting on instruction from U.S. and Swiss judicial officials, arrested senior FIFA officials and others on corruption and racketeering charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>THE PLAYERS: Oceania is headquartered in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city and the confederation's biggest and most adept soccer-playing country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The other 10 countries with voting rights are American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tahiti, Tonga and Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There are three "associate" countries which don't have voting rights: Niue, Kiribati and Tuvalu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The combined population of its member countries is just 15 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>THE CONTEXT: Friday's presidential voting involved all 209 member countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Africa had 54 votes, Europe had 53, Asia 46 votes, North and Central America and the Caribbean 35 votes, Oceania 11 votes and South America 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>So Oceania, a confederation with very little international football pedigree, had one more vote than a conference representing powerhouse South American teams like Brazil and Argentina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>THE SUCCESSES: Oceania has sent teams to the World Cup four times: Australia in 1974 and 2006 and New Zealand in 1982 and 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Australia has since left to join the Asian Football Confederation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>THE HALF SLOT: Oceania is the only FIFA confederation that does not have a guaranteed place in the World Cup finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Between 1966 and 1982, the OFC teams joined the Asian zone qualification tournament, while from 1986, the winners of the Oceania qualifiers had to face a further intercontinental playoff against a team from another confederation in order to gain a spot in the World Cup finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However, Blatter has suggested that Oceania might be soon guaranteed a spot in future World Cup finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>THE SUPPORT FACTOR: The Oceania confederation announced in January and again last month that it would be supporting Blatter, as it has done consistently through his terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>However, New Zealand changed its mind after the FIFA arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>New Zealand's closest neighbors, Asia confederation members Australia, also voted against Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>THE CONTROVERSY: Former FIFA vice president and Oceania confederation president Reynald Temarii of Tahiti was suspended for 12 months in 2010 for breaking FIFA confidentiality rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Temarii was cleared of corruption, but ended his six-year presidency of the OFC after being secretly filmed talking to undercover reporters during lobbying for the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Temarii met with a reporter at OFC headquarters in September 2010 and was filmed appearing to ask for $3 million New Zealand dollars (then $2.3 million; euro1.7 million) to fund a football academy there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Temarii, who maintains his innocence, said he told the journalist that his 2018-2022 votes could not be bought, and says only a small part of the videotaped interview was ever made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Two notaries empty ballot boxes full of ballot papers after the president's election between candidates Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan and current FIFA president Joseph S. Blatter of Switzerland during the 65th FIFA Congress held at the Hallenstadion in Zurich, Switzerland, Friday, May 29, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Sepp Blatter stays president after beating Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein of Jordan in the vote.</td></tr>
