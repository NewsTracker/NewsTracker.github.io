<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple has become the latest retailer to remove products featuring the Confederate flag, after pulling a number of games from the App Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Symbols of the Confederacy are being debated in the US after the man accused of killing nine black people in South Carolina was pictured holding the flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Amazon, Wal-Mart and Sears have all stopped selling the Confederate flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Critics say it's a symbol of racism in southern states in the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The flag, a red rectangle marked with a blue cross embedded with white stars, was a symbol of the pro-slavery south during the American Civil War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Apple has removed our game from App Store because of usage of the Confederate Flag," Game-Labs, the makers of Ultimate General: Gettysburg wrote on their website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We accept Apple's decision and understand that this is a sensitive issue for the American nation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Game-Labs said their game could be put back on the App Store, if they agreed to remove the flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We believe that all historical art forms: books, movies, or games such as ours, help to learn and understand history, depicting events as they were," they wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Therefore we are not going to amend the game's content and Ultimate General: Gettysburg will no longer be available on App Store."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a statement to Newsbeat, Apple said: "We have removed apps from the App Store that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean-spirited ways, which is in violation of our guidelines.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>"They [the games] will be resubmitted with an earlier confederate flag," they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While some people say the flag is a symbol of racism, others argue it's about honouring the Confederate soldiers who gave their lives in America's Civil War which took place between 1861 to 1865.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dylann Roof, who is accused of the killings at church in Charleston, South Carolina, appeared in photos with the banner on a website linked to his name.</td></tr>
