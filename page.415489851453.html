<tr><td>12</td><td>A: "The first priority is the humanitarian needs. People have lost many of their properties.

<tr><td>17</td><td>A: "Very emotional. My heart is for the people. Everyone has that same feeling. We don't know what has happened to our families. Because there is a breakdown in communications we cannot reach our families. We do not know if our families are safe or not. As the leader of the nation, my whole heart is for the people, the nation."</td></tr>
