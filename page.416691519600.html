<h3>Lawmaker: Islamic State kills some 25 captive Iraqi Yazidis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BAGHDAD (AP) " Islamic State group militants shot to death at least 25 captive Yazidis at a prison camp in northern Iraq, a Yazidi lawmaker said Saturday, the latest mass killing carried out by the extremists targeting the sect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The killings took place at a prison camp near the town of Tal Afar, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of the Syrian border or 420 kilometers (260 miles) northwest of Baghdad, legislator Mahma Khalil said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Khalil said he spoke to four different people with knowledge of what happened inside of the camp, though a reason for the killings still wasn't immediately apparent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The militants want to spread horror among them to force them to convert to Islam or to do something else," Khalil said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He added that those killed included men, women and the elderly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said he believes some 1,400 other Yazidis are still held in that camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled in August when the Islamic State group captured the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar, near the Syrian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But hundreds were taken captive by the group, with some Yazidi women forced into slavery, according to international rights groups and Iraqi officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>About 50,000 Yazidis " half of them children, according to U.N. figures " fled to the mountains outside Sinjar during the onslaught.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some still remain there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The U.S. launched airstrikes and humanitarian aid drops in Iraq on Aug. 8, partly in response to the crisis on Sinjar mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Since then, a U.S.-led coalition of countries have conducted airstrikes across Iraq in an effort to destroy the Islamic State group, which now holds a third of both Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Sunni militant group views Yazidis and Shiite Muslims as apostates deserving of death, and has demanded Christians either convert to Islam or pay a special tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Previously, the group has let go of hundreds of other Yazidis held in captivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Iraqi and Kurdish officials said they believe the militants couldn't afford caring for the prisoners, many of whom were elderly and sick.</td></tr>
