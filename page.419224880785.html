<h3>Google and Alphabet: What does this all mean?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google and Alphabet: What does this all mean?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Q&A: Google chief executive Larry Page has announced a dramatic restructuring of the company that will see it renamed Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>We explain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Monday night, Google announced a surprise overhaul that will see the internet giant split up and owned by Alphabet, a new parent company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Parts of Google's more outlandish divisions, such as life sciences, Google X and Nest, will be separated from the core business, which includes search, YouTube and advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google will have a new corporate structure, which will essentially take it from one company that does a huge range of things, to a conglomerate that owns a string of businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That conglomerate will be called Alphabet, the biggest subsidiary of which will be called Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This will be the old Google's core business - search, web advertising, Gmail, YouTube, smartphone software Android and so on - essentially what you and I think of as Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Other businesses owned by Alphabet will be Google's more ambitious research projects such as Life Sciences division Calico, Google X, home automation company Nest Labs, investment group Google Ventures, and internet service provider Google Fiber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Larry Page, who co-founded Google and has run the company since 2011, will be in charge of Alphabet, while Sundar Pichai, who was Page's number two, will take over "new Google".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If that's confusing, maybe this will help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Okay, but why?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Page and Sergey Brin, who co-founded Google two decades ago, have massively diversified Google from its origins as an internet search engine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As well as products that help its core business, which is essentially gathering information and delivering internet adverts that are as relevant as possible, such as Android, Gmail and Maps, it has invested in driverless cars, high-speed internet and home gadgets to name just a few.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, this diversification has created several issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Investors have raised questions about these heavy investments and whether they are really going to pay off, while the broad collection of operations makes it more difficult for analysts to figure out how the core business is really doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Page and Brin, meanwhile, are becoming more focused on the research projects, which may change the world and be highly lucrative, but could take decades to bear fruit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This has led to questions over their commitments to the core business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Developments such as Google Glass, a first attempt at which was retired last year, have been classed as failures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>So the new structure is seen as a win-win: Google's founders are able to step back from the day-to-day running of Google and focus on the big picture, while investors get a clearer picture of the company they own and are able to understand it better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things," Page wrote last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>What will it actually mean?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Not too much to you and me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On the face of it, this is nothing more than a (fairly major) corporate restructuring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Pichai has already been heavily involved in running Google, as Page's effective number two, and Page will still be his boss, so no major strategy changes are too likely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Most of the changes that consumers notice will be cosmetic: Google Fiber, for instance, might be renamed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>However, the restructuring solidifies a change in emphasis from Page and Brin, who still control Google despite not having majority ownership due to the company's dual-class share structure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Potentially, there will be more focus on ambitious research projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Page will certainly have more time to think about them having left day-to-day running to Pichai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"This frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations," he said last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>What does it hold for investors?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Google shareholders will simply become Alphabet shareholders, with no significant change in the structure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Even the stock's Nasdaq tickers, GOOGL and GOOG, will remain the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>However, investors aren't ignoring this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Shares in the company spiked in after-hours trading following the announcement on Monday night, climbing more than 6pc, close to an all-time high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Analysts said the new structure would improve corporate transparency, allowing investors to see the real value of the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Both Alphabet and Google will release quarterly financial results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Another possible advantage is that the company will be able to offer more people the "chief executive" title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Pichai, especially, is highly thought of in the technology community, and was occasionally mentioned as a candidate for the vacant Twitter CEO position, although the theory that Google restructured just to keep him doesn't really stand up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Some financial engineering from the new structure could give shareholders a boost too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Google has very little debt, and could easily borrow money if it wanted to buy back shares from investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The new Google entity would possibly find it cheaper to borrow once it is separated from expensive research projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin meet at Stanford University.Mr Brin, 21, is assigned to show Mr Page around the campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The pair begin to work together on a search engine called BackRub as part of a research project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Google.com is registered as a domain, the name having been chosen as a play on the word &#x201c;googol&#x201d;, the number one followed by 100 zeroes, to represent the near-infinite amount of content on the web.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Google has come a long way in the past 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Google as a company is launched, filing for incorporation in California.The first office is in a garage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The company outgrows the garage and moves to new premises in Palo Alto with eight employees, then later the same year another relocation takes the company to Mountain View, where Google employs its first chef.The company raises $25m in equity funding.</td></tr>
