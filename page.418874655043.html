<h3>Michel Platini to stand as FIFA presidential candidate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Michel Platini will run for FIFA president and plans to announce his intentions this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two officials familiar with Platini's plans tell The Associated Press that the FIFA vice-president has made a decision to try to succeed Sepp Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because Platini has not announced his candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The officials say the UEFA president has been encouraged to run by most leaders of FIFA's continental confederations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The FIFA election is on Feb. 26 and would-be candidates must apply by Oct. 26.</td></tr>
