<h3>After Benjamin Netanyahu warnings, US and Iran resume nuclear talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Montreux, Switzerland: The US and Iranian foreign ministers began a third day of talks over Iran's nuclear program on Wednesday, just hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had warned that the deal being negotiated was a serious mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran's Mohammad Javad Zarif resumed their discussions in the Swiss lakeside town of Montreux, hoping to work out a framework deal by late March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, Mr Netanyahu's controversial speech to the US Congress on Tuesday, where he harshly criticised the diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute, will make it harder for the Obama administration to sell the potential deal back home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The US Secretary of State walks to a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister in Montreux.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Netanyahu argued that rather than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear arms, a deal would "all but guarantee" that it would one day get the atomic bomb, putting Israel, the wider region and US interests at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>US President Barack Obama responded within hours, saying Mr Netanyahu had offered no "viable alternatives" to the current course of negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Iran and world powers are trying to put a framework agreement in place by the end of the month, despite the misgivings of Israel, US congressional Republicans and some Gulf Arab states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Such an accord would be followed by a comprehensive agreement to be completed by the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The aim of the negotiations is to persuade Iran to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions that have crippled the oil exporter's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The United States and some of its allies, notably Israel, suspect Iran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover to develop a nuclear weapons capability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Iran denies this, saying it is for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity.</td></tr>

<h3>WWII Japanese ship Musashi said to be found in Philippines</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Manila: Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen says he has found one of Japan's biggest and most famous battleships on a Philippine seabed, 70 years after American forces sank it during World War II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Excited historians likened the discovery, if verified, to finding the Titanic, as they hailed the American billionaire for his high-tech mission that apparently succeeded after so many failed search attempts by others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Allen posted photos and video online of parts of what he said was the battleship Musashi, found by his M/Y Octopus exploration vessel one kilometre deep on the floor of the Sibuyan Sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What is believed to be an inverted type 89, 12.7 centimetre gun turret of World War II battleship Musashi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"World War II battleship Musashi sank 1944 is found," Mr Allen announced in a Twitter post that has been re-tweeted close to 19,000 times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The discovery was the end of an eight-year search for the Musashi, backed by historical data from four countries and using "advanced technology" that surveyed the seabed, Mr Allen said in a statement on his website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I am honoured to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honouring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her," Mr Allen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Undersea footage on Mr Allen's website showed what were described as a valve, a catapult for planes, a gun turret and a starboard anchor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It also showed the space on the bow for the Japanese empire's Chrysanthemum seal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This is a unique feature of the three biggest warships that Japan built during World War II, said Kazushige Todaka, director of the Kure Maritime Museum in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I'm almost certain that what was discovered is the battleship Musashi," he said, adding the find had huge historical importance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There have been so many efforts over the years to locate Musashi, but they all failed. I feel like the warship might have been destined to show itself this year - the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II," Mr Todaka said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"With the memory of war slipping further and further from people's minds, I hope this discovery will help make the public think about history."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Musashi was one of three vessels built by Japan during the war that, at 263 metres each, were its biggest battleships ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>American warplanes sank the Musashi on October 24, 1944, at the height of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, regarded as the largest naval encounter of the war in which US and Australian forces defeated the Japanese.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dozens of Japanese warships that were sunk during World War II have since been found in the Philippines, with some of them now popular dive locations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Sibuyan Sea where the Musashi was reportedly found is at the heart of the Philippines' central Visayas islands, and is home to busy shipping lanes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Seattle-born Mr Allen, 62, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, is the world's 51st richest person with a net worth of $US17.5 billion ($22.4 billion), according to Forbes magazine.</td></tr>
