<h3>Morrison calls for gay marriage referendum</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Liberal frontbencher Scott Morrison believes the question of legalising same-sex marriage should be put to Australians in a referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Morrison is concerned the current debate is uneven, leaving people expressing their religious views against gay marriage being branded as bigots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A referendum to change section 51 of the constitution would provide the opportunity for both sides of the debate to be put to the Australian people, he told ABC TV on Wednesday.</td></tr>
