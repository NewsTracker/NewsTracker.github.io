<h3>How to get an Apple Watch by Tuesday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>You could pay a lot of money for an Apple Watch on eBay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Or you could keep your fingers crossed and hope that you have a really thoughtful significant other who already bought you one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But now Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is adding a third option to the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple developers received an email this week allowing them to enter a lottery to buy an Apple Watch Sport with a 42mm silver aluminum case and a blue sport band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The best part: It's guaranteed to ship by April 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To take part in the random drawing, developers have to enter the lottery by Thursday at 1 p.m. ET.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple says "quantities are limited."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The news was first reported by MacRumors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple wants to get the smartwatch in the hands of developers as quickly as possible, because the company wants to increase the number of apps available on the Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple is facing a major Watch supply shortage, and shipping dates for pre-orders are extending into July for some models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple scrapped plans to make its new smartwatch available for purchase in stores this Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>You can still pre-order an Apple Watch online, and you can make an appointment to try one on in an Apple Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But you'll likely have to wait until at least June for your Apple Watch to ship to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Unless you win the lottery.</td></tr>
