<h3>'Amy' director on Winehouse family reaction: 'Did they expect a One Direction movie?' [Video]</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>'Amy' director on Winehouse family reaction: 'Did they expect a One Direction movie?'</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Asif Kapadia had no agenda when he set out to make Amy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He just wanted to tell Amy Winehouse's story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kapadia, who grew up in North London, was approached by Universal Music UK honcho David Joseph to make the movie; Joseph is the label executive who announced a few days ago that Amy Winehouse's unreleased demos have been destroyed to prevent a flurry of posthumous subpar releases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Joseph described his actions as a "moral thing," possibly the first time that phrase has ever been used in a recording industry story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But we digress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Warts 'n' all" is the Amy Winehouse movie Joseph wanted Kapadia to make; the filmmaker had carte blanche from the label and then slowly won the cooperation of everyone he wanted to talk to for Amy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The film has had extraordinary success already, although some people (such as Mitch Winehouse) were less enthusiastic when they saw the finished product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"What they expected, I don't know," says Kapadia, who visited Toronto to promote Amy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Maybe they thought they were going to get The One Direction movie."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The award-winning Kapadia came to filmmaking through a route more circuitous than most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He is the youngest in a family of five children, "And my parents, by the time they got to me, they just let me do whatever I liked, which was great."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nobody else in his family was involved in the creative world, says Kapadia, "And I got into it accidentally."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kapadia was studying graphic design when he got a job as a gopher on a movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It was thrilling for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I thought, 'This is great! So exciting!'" He laughs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I'm carrying boxes in and out of a truck in the rain. And then this bus goes somewhere else, and I go with them -- it's like travelling."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He elaborates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I come from an ordinary, working class background and my family never went anywhere. And I love travelling. I love to go places and meet people. So film was kind of like my way of escape from a pretty rough part of London, at the time. I was studying and working for other people. Every holiday I'd work for free on films."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It wasn't even a job, he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I just enjoyed it. I did the gopher thing, then I was a sound recordist, and I was a camera assistant, and I was being paid to work while I was also studying."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Kapadia essentially learned filmmaking while pursuing his love of travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I come from making movies, rather than watching movies," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>His graduate film for the Royal College of Art, a short called the Sheep Thief, is tied to his personal history, says Kapadia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He made the film in India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The Sheep Thief was made with street kids," he says, "non-professionals in India. It was really tough, the toughest film I've made probably, and I learned a lot" I got to learn about my heritage while I was creating art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That film was really my step into the industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It got me an agent, won an award at Cannes, won quite a few awards around the world," he understates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"The designer on that film is now my wife, and we have kids, so it was really a life-changing experience."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Adds Kapadia, "And everyone said about The Sheep Thief, 'It's not going to work.' And I think there was always something in me, even previous to that, that every film has to be a challenge to myself, pushing myself creatively to the limit. With every movie it's been a bit like that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>His first feature, The Warrior won a slew of awards; his documentary, Senna, about Brazilian racer Ayrton Senna, changed the face of documentary filmmaking and won Kapadia two BAFTAs, among many other honours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Kapadia describes Amy as his "musical," noting that the film is a bit like a Bollywood movie -- because the songs are the narrative, and the songs came first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"What we have to do is write the story around the songs. For the first time, the lyrics fit a bigger picture," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He adds, "I liked her live performances much better than the records. I liked the simplicity of just her and a guitar."</td></tr>
