<tr><td>7</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Thousands of people hit the streets in Baltimore and several other cities from Boston and New York to Indianapolis and Washington, D.C., on Wednesday to protest the death of a black man who died of spinal injuries after his arrest by Baltimore police and to demand reforms to police procedures.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Hundreds of protesters, many of them students wearing backpacks, marched through downtown, calling for swift justice in the case of Gray.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>She will then face a decision on whether and how to pursue charges against the six police officers who arrested Gray.</td></tr>
