<h3>Bali nine pair executions days away with final legal hurdle to be cleared Monday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The last legal hurdle preventing the death of Bali nine organisers Myuran and Andrew Chan and eight other drug felons will be resolved on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The end is near for those facing the death sentence, with lawyers in tears as they told Fairfax Media their clients' embassies had been summoned to Cilacap, near the island where the executions will be staged, on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Attorney-General spokesman Tony Spontana said the date of the execution would be set once the outcome of the appeal by Indonesian marijuana trafficker Zainal Abidin was known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Supreme Court spokesman Suhadi told Fairfax Media the panel of judges would convene on Monday and make their ruling on Abidin's judicial review request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"If Zainal's appeal is rejected, it will complete the [appeals of] the inmates," Mr Spontana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said the embassies had been notified because Indonesia was entering the execution stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Spontana said the prisoners would be given at least three days' notice before they are shot by firing squad on the remote penal island of Nusakambangan in Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The theme of the executions will be the war on drugs," Mr Spontana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Filipina maid Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso was the last prisoner facing imminent execution to be transferred to Nusakambangan on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tragically, she missed seeing her children, who flew into Yogyakarta on Friday, by a matter of hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Her two sons, Mark Darren and Mark Daniel, had earlier released a heartbreaking video to Indonesian president Joko 's 19-year-old son begging for their mother's life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prosecutors, who under Indonesian law are required to be present at executions, were also travelling to Cilacap on Friday in a further sign the executions are just days away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The families of the condemned Australians have not abandoned hope there will be a stay of execution as they scramble to get to Central Java to see the pair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I can't believe this is it. We still haven't given up hope," said Chinthu Sukumaran, Myuran's brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Andrew Chan's brother, Michael, is also planning to leave with family and supporters on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I just want to go over and see how he is," said Michael.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Bali nine member Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, serving life imprisonment in Malang Prison in East Java, told Fairfax Media he was speechless and "really really sad".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Although several prisoners, including Sukumaran and Chan, still have legal processes under way, the Attorney-General's Office says all but Abidin have exhausted their legal avenues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Lawyers for the Australians are challenging the clemency laws in the Constitutional Court and the Judicial Commission is investigating allegations the judges who sentenced Chan and Sukumaran to death offered bribes for lighter sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>However, any ruling made on the country's clemency laws by the Constitutional Court would not be retrospective and the Attorney-General has made it clear the case would not prevent the executions from proceeding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop contacted Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno to register her concern at recent developments, following her written representation to her this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A spokeswoman said Ms Bishop was informed Ms Marsudi was attending the Asia-Africa Conference and was unavailable to speak with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Therefore, our Embassy has lodged a formal request for a telephone call to take place," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Veloso's legal team is planning to lodge a request for a second judicial review on the grounds she was "primarily a human trafficking victim in the first place, and therefore, must be protected".</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And lawyers for Brazilian man Rodrigo Gularte, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, are seeking to have his cousin appointed his guardian because he is mentally ill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>They will then request a judicial review of his case claiming he was sick when he committed the drug trafficking crime and should be hospitalised not executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The other prisoners facing execution are Ghanaian Martin Anderson, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, Frenchman Serge Areski Atlaoui, and Nigerians Okwudili Oyatanze and Sylvester Obiekwe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Bali nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran...</td></tr>
