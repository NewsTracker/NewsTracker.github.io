<h3>Israel's Netanyahu completes formation of government</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Wednesday, April 22, 2015 file photo, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaves the podium after speaking during a Memorial Day ceremony to commemorate the country's fallen soldiers at Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With a little over 24 hours to go, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scrambling to get his governing coalition together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu has had a tough time striking deals with potential partners to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If he fails by midnight Wednesday then President Reuven Rivlin will task someone else with the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu completed the formation of a new coalition late Wednesday, putting him at the helm of a hard-line government that appears to be set on a collision course with the U.S. and other key allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Netanyahu reached a deal with the nationalist Jewish Home party shortly before a midnight deadline, clinching a slim parliamentary majority and averting an embarrassing scenario that would have forced him from office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But with a government dominated by hard-liners that support increased West Bank settlement construction and oppose peace moves with the Palestinians, he could have a hard time rallying international support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Controlling just 61 of 120 parliamentary seats, the narrow coalition could also struggle to press forward with a domestic agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After Netanyahu's Likud Party won March 17 elections with 30 seats, it seemed he would have a relatively easy time forming a coalition and serving a fourth term as prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the six-week negotiating process, which expired at midnight, turned out to be much more difficult than anticipated as rival coalition partners and members of the Likud jockeyed for influential Cabinet ministries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I am sure that nobody is surprised that the negotiations continued with all the factions and nobody is surprised it ended at the time it did," Netanyahu said late Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He vowed to install "a strong and stable government for the people of Israel" by next week, yet also hinted he would court additional partners in the near future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Sixty-one is a good number, and 61-plus is an even better number," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But it starts at 61 and we will begin. We have a lot of work ahead of us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The coalition talks stalled this week when Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, a longtime partner of Netanyahu's, unexpectedly stepped down and announced his secular nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party was joining the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That left Netanyahu dependent on Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett, a former aide who has a rocky relationship with Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>With Bennett driving a hard bargain, the talks stretched throughout the day and well into the night before Netanyahu called President Reuven Rivlin, as required by law, to announce the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I congratulate you on completing the formation of the government. I have received your letter of confirmation, and look forward to the convening of the Knesset as soon as possible, to approve the government," Rivlin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Netanyahu had until midnight to speak to Rivlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Otherwise, the president would have been required to ask another politician to try to form a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Analysts do not expect the new government to last long or accomplish much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Opposition leader Isaac Herzog, head of the centrist Zionist Union, called the coalition "a national failure government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He said it was "an embarrassing farce" and "the narrowest in Israel's history."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>During the campaign, Netanyahu angered the White House when he said that he would not allow the establishment of a Palestinian state on his watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Although he has tried to backtrack, the White House has reacted with skepticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Netanyahu's Likud Party is dominated by hard-liners opposed to Palestinian independence, a position that is shared by the Jewish Home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The odds of peace talks restarting - much less making any progress - appear slim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Jewish Home's close ties with the settler movement mean that there will likely be great pressure on the new government to expand construction on occupied lands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The international community overwhelmingly opposes settlement construction, and the Palestinians are trying to push forward with a war crimes case against the settlements at the International Criminal Court in the Hague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>U.S. officials have said they could have a hard time defending Israeli policies if the government isn't committed to a two-state solution with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The new government could also struggle at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Under the coalition deal, the Jewish Home gained control of the influential Education and Justice Ministries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The incoming justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, is an outspoken critic of the country's judiciary and is expected to seek a greater voice in the appointment of judges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Meanwhile, Netanyahu's ultra-Orthodox partners, Shas and United Torah Judaism, are bent on reversing reforms passed by the last government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Those reforms sought to end an unpopular system that granted the ultra-Orthodox exemptions from compulsory military service, welfare subsidies to study full-time instead of entering the work force and generous budgets for a religious school system that largely ignores key subjects like math, English and computer studies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>These longstanding benefits have bred widespread resentment among the secular majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Wiping out the reforms is likely to generate renewed public anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Yair Lapid, whose Yesh Atid party spearheaded the outgoing government's reforms, said there was little to celebrate Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"A narrow, suspicious and sectoral government is on its way," he said, vowing to "do everything" to stop "the clearance sale of the country" to parties with narrow interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Netanyahu's last partner, Kulanu, is a centrist party focused on bringing relief to Israel's struggling middle class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Although in control of the Finance Ministry, the party could struggle passing reforms due to the slim parliamentary majority.</td></tr>
