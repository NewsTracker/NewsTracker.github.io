<h3>Egypt jails 69 Islamists for torching church</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt jailed 69 Islamists for life Wednesday for torching a church near Cairo in August 2013 during a crackdown on supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi, a judicial official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Coptic church was set on fire and a police station was attacked when violence erupted in the town of Kerdasa on August 14 that year, after hundreds of Morsi supporters died in a crackdown on two protest camps in the capital the same day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The court also sentenced two minors to 10 years in jail in the same case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been given death sentences or life in jail after often speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called "unprecedented in recent history".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Morsi himself was given a 20-year prison term by a court last week for ordering the arrest and torture of demonstrators involved in clashes in 2012 when he was president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Islamist was ousted by then army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on July 3, 2013 after mass street protests against his year-long divisive rule.</td></tr>
