<h3>Online image purports to show Croat killed by Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) " An online image circulated Wednesday purported to show a Croatian hostage held by the Islamic State group's Egyptian affiliate beheaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The still image, shared by Islamic State sympathizers on social media, showed the apparent body of Tomislav Salopek, a married, 30-year-old father of two, wearing a beige jumpsuit looking like the one he had worn in a previous video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A black flag used by the Islamic State group and a knife were planted in the sand next to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The photo carried a caption in Arabic that said Salopek was killed "for his country's participation in the war against the Islamic State," and after a deadline had passed for the Egyptian government to meet their demands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This comes after the Islamic State affiliate set a Friday deadline for Egyptian authorities to free "Muslim women," a term referring to female Islamist prisoners detained in a sweeping government crackdown following the 2013 military ouster of an Islamist president.</td></tr>
