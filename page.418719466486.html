<h3>Bianchi death overshadows F1 title tussle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The championship tussle between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will take a back seat at the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend, with Formula One still coming to terms with the death of Jules Bianchi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 25-year-old Bianchi died in a hospital in his hometown of Nice on Friday from injuries suffered in a head-on crash during last October's Japanese GP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The outpouring of sympathy and support for Bianchi's family reflected just how popular he was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was also highly rated, and made enough of an impression in his 34 GPs for many observers to predict he would be a future star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bianchi had been expected to replace Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hamilton, Rosberg, Brazilian driver Felipe Massa and French driver Romain Grosjean attended Bianchi's funeral at the Sainte Reparate Cathedral in Nice on Tuesday, along with four-time F1 champions Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel and FIA president Jean Todt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Saying goodbye to Jules was incredibly hard for everyone," Hamilton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"For myself, I wished I had known him better. But from what I knew of him, he was a kind heart with a great spirit and a bright future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nice is about 30km from the track where Bianchi sealed the best performance of his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Driving for Marussia - now known as Manor Marussia - he finished ninth at the Monaco GP last year and gave the unheralded team its first points in F1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bianchi made his GP debut for Marussia in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The previous year, he drove for the Force India team in several practice sessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We had the pleasure of working with Jules during 2012 and he left a strong impression on everyone," Force India team principal Vijay Mallya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"An outstanding young man and a tremendous talent who was destined for great things in Formula One. The world has lost a true racer and we have all lost a friend."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Bianchi's accident occurred at the end of the race at the Suzuka circuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In rainy, gloomy conditions, his car slid off the track and ploughed into a crane picking up the Sauber of German driver Adrian Sutil, who crashed one lap earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The accident prompted F1 to alter its rules, allowing a "virtual safety car" in which stewards can neutralise a race, forcing all cars to proceed slowly into the pit lane rather than continuing to lap the circuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The start times of some races were also moved forward to avoid them continuing in dim light conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Governing body FIA will retire the number 17 - Bianchi's racing car number last year - in his honour, and it will be an emotional weekend at the Hungaroring circuit.</td></tr>
