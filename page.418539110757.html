<h3>Violent protests as Greek parliament debates austerity bill</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Protesters clashed with police in front of the Greek parliament on Wednesday, ahead of a vote on an austerity bill that will condemn the country to years of more budget savings in exchange for a desperately needed bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police responded with tear gas, sending hundreds of people fleeing in central Syntagma Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Once a common sight in protest marches in Greece, clashes with police had been rare since the leftist Syriza party came to power in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Just before the clashes, protesters marched waving banners reading "Cancel the bailout!" and "No to the policies of the EU, the ECB and the IMF."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pharmacists pulled down their shutters across Greece and civil servants walked off their jobs in protest in a 24-hour strike against reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Further austerity is unacceptable," said Stavros Koutsioubelis, a spokesman for the ADEDY public sector union, urging lawmakers to reject the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Opposition on the streets has so far been limited, however, and an opinion poll published on Tuesday suggested that more than 70 per cent of people want parliament to approve the bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The raft of consumer tax increases and pension reforms demanded by Greece's creditors has led to growing anger among the country's governing left-wing Syriza party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The vote will almost certainly see large numbers of Tsipras's own Syriza lawmakers dissent and vote against the package, raising questions of his government's survival in its current form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The bill is expected to pass with votes in favor by pro-European opposition parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The government, a coalition between Syriza and the small right-wing Independent Greeks, holds 162 seats in Greece's 300-member parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More than 30 of Syriza's own lawmakers have publicly voiced objections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Riot police stand amongst the flames from exploded petrol bombs thrown by a small group of anti-establishment demonstrators in front of parliament in Athens, Greece, on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Deputy Finance Minister Nadia Valavani resigned from government in protest over the austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Arriving in parliament, Valavani said she was not going to vote in favour of the agreement, and that this meant she could not stay on as part of the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tsipras has acknowledged the measures he agreed to after a marathon summit with eurozone leaders on Monday go against his election pledges to make life easier for Greeks, and described them in a Tuesday night television interview as "irrational."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But he said he had no option if he was to prevent Greece's financial collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Talks on a bailout package worth 85 billion euros over three years will start only if Greece's government takes certain steps, including pushing through Wednesday's bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The International Monetary Fund, which was involved Greece's previous two bailouts and will also play a role in the third, has long advocated the country's debt is too high and that any deal must include debt relief - something the Greek side has also insisted on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In a report released late Tuesday, the IMF said Greece's debt was now "highly unsustainable" and would reach "close to 200 per cent of GDP in the next two years."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The IMF said that "Greece's debt can now only be made sustainable through debt relief measures that go far beyond what Europe has been willing to consider so far."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tsipras has faced strident dissent even from some of his top ministers, with Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis saying in a post on his ministry's website that the deal the prime minister reached was "unacceptable" and calling on him to withdraw it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The bill was being passed through parliament with emergency procedures and was being debated at committee level Wednesday morning before it heads to the full assembly in the evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Greece's Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos gives a speech Wednesday in parliament as lawmakers debated the austerity bill Greece must pass before the country can start talks on a third international bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Greeks, meanwhile, continued to struggle with limits on cash withdrawals and transfers outside of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Banks were shut down June 29 and the finance ministry said they would remain closed through Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>With its banks dangerously low on liquidity and the state practically out of cash, Greece desperately needs funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It faces a Monday deadline to repay 4.2 billion euros to the European Central Bank, and is also in arrears on two billion euros to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Negotiations on the new bailout will take an estimated four weeks, leaving EU finance ministers scrambling to find ways to get Athens some money sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew was travelling to Europe to confer with leaders about the Greek crisis, and was to meet Wednesday in Frankfurt with ECB chief Mario Draghi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>On Thursday, he meets the German and French finance ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The months-long standoff between Greece and its creditors has taken a heavy toll on an economy that had begun the year with a 2.9 per cent growth forecast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>On Tuesday, a Greek small business association said that the new austerity measures would likely cause the economy to shrink for a seventh year, with a 3.5 per cent drop in output.</td></tr>
