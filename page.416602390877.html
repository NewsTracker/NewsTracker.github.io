<h3>Greece: Public broadcaster reinstated by new govt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Lawmakers from Greece's new left-wing government have voted to reinstate the country's public broadcaster, ERT, which was abruptly shut down two years ago as part of austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Parliament voted early Wednesday to re-hire more than 1,500 ERT workers and incorporate a protest TV station operated online by fired employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In June 2013, ERT television and radio broadcasts were abruptly taken off the air by the previous conservative government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A new broadcaster was later opened, using fewer staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece had been under pressure from international lenders to swiftly reduce the size of its civil service in return for continued bailout loans.</td></tr>
