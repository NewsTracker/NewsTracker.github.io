<tr><td>2</td><td>A strong magnitude earthquake shook Nepal's capital and the densely populated Kathmandu valley on Saturday devastating the region and leaving tens of thousands shell-shocked and sleeping in streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jagdish Pokhrel, the clearly exhausted army spokesman, says nearly the entire 100,000-soldier army is involved in rescue operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"90 percent of the army's out there working on search and rescue," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are focusing our efforts on that, on saving lives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fears are growing that thousands of people may remain cut off in isolated, devastated mountain villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Udav Prashad Timalsina, the top official for the Gorkha district where Saturday's quake was centered, says he is in desperate need of help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Things are really bad in the district, especially in remote mountain villages. There are people who are not getting food and shelter. I have had reports of villages where 70 percent of the houses have been destroyed," he said when contacted by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We have been calling for help, but we haven't received enough from the central government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He says 223 people had been confirmed dead in the district but he presumed "the number would go up because there are thousands who are injured."</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>A sense of eerie calm and uneasiness hangs over the capital, Kathmandu, as the aftershocks keep coming for a third day after the massive quake on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>People are still trying to absorb what's happening to them and their city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Part of their anxiety appears to be fueled by a near complete absence of any real information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Power lines are down and there is almost no Internet connectivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Phone connections are spotty at best.</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>The feature, launched in October, allows users to tell friends and family they are safe if they are in the middle of a disaster area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Facebook engineers in Japan started development on the feature after the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The Kathmandu earthquake was one of the first natural disasters where it has been used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Google, which lost an employee in an avalanche as a result of the earthquake, has activated its own disaster tool called "Person Finder" http://google.org/personfinder/2015-nepal-earthquake/ and is updating satellite imagery to help with relief efforts.</td></tr>

<tr><td>40</td><td>Kathmandu district chief administrator Ek Narayan Aryal says tents and water are being handed at 10 locations in Nepal's capital, but that the many aftershocks were leaving everyone jittery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>There's a bottleneck in the efforts to get relief to Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The good news: Kathmandu's airport is open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The bad news: It's been a bumpy, frustration-filled experience for those arriving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The second bit of good news: Some aid vehicles have been able to travel overland from Indian to the stricken Nepalese city of Pokhara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Ben Pickering, Save the Children's humanitarian adviser in Britain, calls that a positive sign.</td></tr>
