<h3>Obama calls for gay rights in Africa, challenges Kenya on corruption</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: US president Barack Obama (L) and Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta hold a joint news conference after their meeting in Nairobi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>US president Barack Obama has called for gay rights in Africa during his landmark visit to Kenya, comparing homophobia to racial discrimination he had encountered in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a joint press conference after talks with Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta, Mr Obama also pushed a tough message on Kenyan corruption, the civil war in South Sudan, controversial elections in Burundi and the fight against Somalia's Al Qaeda-affiliated Al Shabaab militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Obama arrived in Kenya on Friday, his first visit as president to his father's birthplace and the first to the East African nation by a serving US leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I've been consistent all across Africa on this. When you start treating people differently, because they're different, that's the path whereby freedoms begin to erode. And bad things happen," he said after talks with the Kenyan leader, in response to a question on gay rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"As an African-American in the United States, I am painfully aware of what happens when people are treated differently under the law. I am unequivocal on this," Mr Obama told a joint news conference, openly disagreeing with Mr Kenyatta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said that the notion "a law-abiding citizen ... will be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong, full stop."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Homophobia is on the rise in Africa, and Mr Kenyatta repeated the view that gay rights were "a non-issue."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There are some things that we must admit we don't share. It's very difficult for us to impose on people that which they themselves do not accept. This is why I say for Kenyans today the issue of gay rights is really a non-issue," Mr Kenyatta said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kenya, like many African states, outlaws homosexual relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kenyan deputy president William Ruto, who attended talks with Mr Obama, said in May there was "no room" for gays in Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Obama also had firm words for Kenya on civil rights and corruption, describing endemic graft as "the single biggest impediment to Kenya growing even faster," and saying people were being "consistently sapped by corruption at a high level and at a low level."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"They don't have to be a forensic accountant to know what is going on," Mr Obama said, giving the example of officials driving around in expensive cars or building houses far above what their salaries would allow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The two leaders also pledged greater cooperation against the Somalia's Al Shabaab, who have also been at the top of the list of security concerns during the visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Nairobi has witnessed massive security operations involving at least 10,000 police officers, with parts of the usually traffic-clogged capital locked down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We have systematically reduced the territory that Al Shabaab controls. We have been able to decrease their effective control within Somalia and have weakened those networks operating here in East Africa. That doesn't mean the problem is solved," Mr Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The president called for an end to the 19-month-old civil war in South Sudan, urging the country's warring leaders to "put their country first".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The conflict there is set to be high on the agenda for the next stage of his visit to Ethiopia, also the seat of the African Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This week's elections in the central African nation of Burundi, which delivered a controversial third term to president Pierre Nkurunziza, "were not credible", Mr Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Despite the areas of disagreement, Mr Obama said he was delighted to be back and praised Africa's entrepreneurship at a business summit earlier in the day.</td></tr>
