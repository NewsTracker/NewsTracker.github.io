<h3>Facebook&#039;s Sandberg remembers late husband</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook senior exec Sheryl Sandberg has posted a moving tribute to her husband, who died after a workout accident last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg says she is devastated by the sudden death of her husband, but lucky to have known him and shared her life with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>US tech executive David Goldberg apparently died after falling on a treadmill and striking his head during a family trip to a Pacific coast resort in Punta Mita, in Mexico's Nayarit state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An autopsy in the Mexican state of Nayarit has ruled out foul play in Goldberg's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was a terribly tragic blow for one of America's best-known business executives, famous for her efforts to encourage women's empowerment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Goldberg, 47, was the chief executive of online polling firm SurveyMonkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a post on Facebook on Tuesday, Sandberg paid tribute to her late husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Dave and I did not get nearly enough time together. But as heartbroken as I am today, I am equally grateful. Even in these last few days of completely unexpected hell - the darkest and saddest moments of my life - I know how lucky I have been," she wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If the day I walked down that aisle with Dave someone had told me that this would happen - that he would be taken from us all in just 11 years - I would still have walked down that aisle," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"As we put the love of my life to rest today, we buried only his body. His spirit, his soul, his amazing ability to give is still with it," Sandberg wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>President Barack Obama remembered Goldberg as a leader who always tried to empower others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He was generous and kind with everybody, and cared less about the limelight than making sure that the people he worked with and loved succeeded in whatever they did," Obama tweeted earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A genial bear of a man, Goldberg was often introduced in national media appearances as Sandberg's husband after her book Lean In helped spur public dialogue about working women and the need for men to support their spouses by sharing duties at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But to many in Silicon Valley, Goldberg was also known as an entrepreneur, investor and mentor who generously shared business advice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As chief executive of SurveyMonkey, he was credited with overseeing its growth to a current valuation of $US2 billion ($A2.5 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He was a perfect cross between a teddy bear and a tiger," former Yahoo president Sue Decker wrote on a tribute page for Goldberg.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>Tech industry luminaries and friends gathered for the memorial service honouring Goldberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>U2 vocalist Bono sang before an audience that included Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, film director George Lucas and a host of tech company founders, executives and financiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Afterward, mourners emerged teary-eyed from Stanford University's Memorial Auditorium, many wearing Minnesota Vikings paraphernalia to commemorate the NFL team loved by Goldberg, a Minneapolis native.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Goldberg and Sandberg married in 2004 and they have two children.</td></tr>
