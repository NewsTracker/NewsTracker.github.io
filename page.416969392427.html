<h3>Colts taking quiet approach to debate over Deflategate (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Dwayne Allen was in an awkward position Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As a tight end for the Colts, he was trying to toe the company line on ''Deflategate.'' As a player rep, he found himself defending Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For Allen and his teammates in the Indianapolis locker room Wednesday, speaking about this year's big offseason scandal has become an increasingly delicate balancing act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I had no idea what judgment was going to come down,'' Allen said when asked about Brady's four-game suspension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That's about as much as anybody in Indy's organization has said since the Wells report implicated Brady and two Patriots employees for deliberating underinflating game balls in January's AFC championship game - a 45-7 blowout of the Colts in Foxboro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>General manager Ryan Grigson, who tipped off the NFL about the Patriots using illegal game balls, still has not spoken publicly about the investigation or the punishments announced Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In addition to Brady's suspension, the Patriots were fined $1 million and will have to give up a first-round pick next year and a fourth-round pick in 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While Patriots owner Robert Kraft has been outspoken that the penalties were too harsh, the Colts have mostly remained silent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Punter Pat McAfee, the pace-car driver for last weekend's race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, carefully weaved his way around the topic last Friday by saying it was a ''shame'' that the scandal had ''cast a shadow'' over the sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Coach Chuck Pagano said simply that the team was moving forward when rookie mini-camp opened last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Players did their best Wednesday to dampen any chatter over the Patriots' integrity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''That team's a great team, a great organization,'' said cornerback Darius Butler, who entered the league as New England's second-round draft pick in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''Obviously Brady's one of the all-time best quarterbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I've been a part of that organization personally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Nobody in the organization contends Indy's loss in January was the result of illegal footballs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Brady has had the Colts' number for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He opened his career with six straight wins over Indy, including twice the playoffs, then lost four of the next five including the AFC championship game following the 2006 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Since then, Brady has gone 6-0 against the Colts, winning by a combined score of 251-125.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He is 4-0 all-time against Andrew Luck, and the Patriots have eliminated Indy from the playoffs each of the past two seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Colts have spent most of the offseason looking for ways to get past New England this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Of course, the topic of the Patriots will surely come up in the fall: If Brady's suspension is upheld, his season debut would likely come in Indy on Oct. 18.</td></tr>
