<h3>Florida artist claims Apple stole his style</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The lawsuit, filed on April 6 in the Southern District of Florida, claims Apple and its design firm mirrored Brazilian-born Romero Britto's style in artwork used in Apple's "Start Something New" campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple's work features a rainbow-colored hand emitting multicolor wisps of smoke on its website and at retail locations across the world, according to the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I came across them in Las Vegas in late January, and then in China three weeks later," said Britto's lawyer Robert Zarco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The suit demands Apple and the design firm Craig & Karl immediately cease using the images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Britto's "distinctive style of artwork has become so famous and pervasive as to constitute a distinctive trade dress that identifies the highly-coveted lifestyle brand," the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A monetary demand has yet to be filed, however "the amount is going to be in the millions of dollars," Zarco added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A spokesman for Apple and Craig & Karl - designers Craig Redman of New York and Karl Maier of London - couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Britto's vivid work is featured across Miami where it has made its way onto tourist and lifestyle goods that have been disbursed across the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His art has been printed on the Florida lottery tickets, Barbie dolls, and baby strollers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Britto was born in 1963 in the Pernambuco region of Brazil and later immigrated to Miami with his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He opened his main gallery on Miami Beach's Lincoln Road in 1993 as the outdoor mall was on the verge of becoming a worldwide tourist attraction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The case in the Southern District of Florida is Britto Central, Inc. v.</td></tr>
