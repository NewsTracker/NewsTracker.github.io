<h3>Apple Pay UK launch: Everything you need to know</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>YOUR iPhone is about to replace your wallet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And it starts across the UK tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple Pay - which was announced at WWDC - will hit UK stores tomorrow morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As soon as the new payment system goes live, iPhone and Apple Watch owners will be able to use their Apple-branded gadgets instead of debit and credit cards at checkout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple Pay will allow iPhone users to "tap-and-pay" with their smartphones for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The UK launch also marks the first time the software will be available outside the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Starting tomorrow, Apple iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch owners will be able to use the new payment system in more than 250,000 locations across the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Express.co.uk has rounded up some of the most common questions around the launch - and answered them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Which Apple devices do I need to use Apple Pay?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Those who want to replace their humble debit card with Apple Pay will need either an iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus or Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>These are the only devices which support tap-to-pay because they are the only Apple devices with the NFC chip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However - Apple Pay also works online across a number of retailers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This feature - which secures the online transaction with your fingerprint - works across a slightly larger spread of Apple devices, including the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 and the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some reports have suggested older phones may work in the future but, for now, anyone without the latest Apple iPhone will have to stick to good old fashioned chip-and-pin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Apple Pay uses Near Field Communication antenna technology, dubbed NFC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This system - which is also available in a range of Android devices and used for rival payment solutions - allows the iPhone to communicate wirelessly with the contactless payment machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Once the system has gone live, Apple iPhone owners will be able to hold their smartphone close to a contactless reader while keeping their finger on the Touch ID fingerprint scanner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This authorises the payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The smartphone will vibrate to let you know the payment has been approved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Apple Pay will automatically pay using the customers default card, although you can cycle through the available credit and debit cards at checkout on the smartphone or Watch display.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Credit, debit and loyalty cards can all be kept within the iPhone's preinstalled passbook app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Cards can be added by taking a photograph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Will my bank let me use Apple Pay?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Eight British banks will support the new mobile payment system at launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>American Express, First Direct, HSBC, Nationwide, Natwest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Ulster Bank customers will all be able to use the system in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Lloyds Bank, M&S Bank, MBNA and TSB have all announced plans to support Apple Pay - although a final date has not been released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Barclays - which recently refreshed its own wearable payment system - will not support the iPhone payment system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Where can I shop with Apple Pay?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Apple claims a staggering 250,000 stores - as well as the entire Transport for London underground, bus and rail network - will accept Apple Pay as soon as the system goes live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Shops already signed up to support the system include Starbucks, Costa, M&S, McDonald's, KFC, Pret A Manger, Boots, JD Sports, Nando's, Lidl and Waitrose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Apple claims more will be added "every day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Is Apple Pay secure?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Apple says privacy and security is a key part of Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Once you have added a credit or debit card to your device, the card numbers are never shared again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Apple does not upload them to its servers - nor does it even reveal your card details to the merchant you are paying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Instead the privacy-minded firm creates an entirely new "unique Device Account Number".</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>This is "assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element, a dedicated chip in iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Since every device has a separate Secure Element, card details have to be entered separately on each Apple device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"And when you make a purchase, the Device Account Number, along with a transaction-specific dynamic security code, is used to process your payment," Apple explains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"So your actual credit or debit card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants or transmitted with payment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Apple say their service is far more secure than current payment methods since every time you hand over your physical credit or debit card to pay - your card number, details and identity are visible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Each time you pay you'll need to use the Touch ID fingerprint scanner - this allows your iPhone and iPad to identify you as the shopper and adds a layer of biometric security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>If your device is stolen you can immediately revoke the ability to make payments using your Apple account via the iCloud website.</td></tr>
