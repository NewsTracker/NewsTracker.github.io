<h3>Carlsberg slashes 2015 earnings forecast as Russia, Ukraine weigh on second-quarter results</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>COPENHAGEN, Denmark - Danish brewer Carlsberg has lowered its full-year earnings forecast after declining beer sales in Russia and Ukraine hurt second-quarter profits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Carlsberg, which had previously forecast single-digit growth in operating profit in 2015, said Wednesday it now expects a slight decline, citing "challenging market conditions" in Eastern Europe and weaker-than-expected results in Western Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It said the beer market declined 9 percent in Russia and 17 percent in Ukraine, where Moscow is accused of supporting a separatist rebellion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Western European sales fell due to bad weather and compared with a jump a year earlier drive by the World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Second-quarter net profit dropped 28 percent to 1.59 billion kroner ($236 million), while revenue fell 2 percent to 18.9 billion kroner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Carlsberg shares fell 8 percent in early trading in Copenhagen.</td></tr>
