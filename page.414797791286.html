<h3>Water, air quality concerns heighten conflict with pig farms</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Richard Brown lives in the nation's top county for hog production and is one of the hundreds who've joined the federal lawsuits against Murphy-Brown over air and water quality concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Modern meat production, in which thousands of animals are packed into barns for concentrated feeding operations, has proven to be efficient and profitable, but comes with its own set of problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>From Washington state to North Carolina, federal lawsuits are challenging the livestock industry to change its ways, basing arguments on studies that increasingly show the impact that phosphorous, nitrates and bacteria from fertilizer and accumulated manure have on lakes and rivers, as well as air pollution that can be harmful to respiratory health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Livestock farmers insist they're trying to ameliorate the problem by installing grass strips, tilling less and using other techniques to keep manure and fertilizer from draining into waterways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I have a general care and concern for the state's water quality and I've personally invested my own dollars to install conservation nutrient retention practices on my farm," said Bill Couser, a fifth-generation Iowa farmer with 5,200 cows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We realize this is not going to happen overnight or in two years. This could take up to 10 years as this technology comes along."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, those who rely on rivers and lakes for drinking water or live near the large-scale operations - especially in the top two hog-producing states of Iowa and North Carolina - are growing impatient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Joined by environmental and animal rights groups in a growing number of lawsuits, they're highlighting the debate between the right to raise livestock and the right to clean water and air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Des Moines' water utility, which serves a half-million people, recently filed a notice of intent to sue farmers in three counties populated by 1.2 million pigs and a million turkeys because it must run water sourced from two central Iowa rivers through a costly system to strip out nitrate, which at levels above a federal limit can reduce the amount of oxygen carried in the blood of children younger than 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A federal judge in eastern Washington ruled last month that an industrial dairy farm's manure management practices posed an "imminent and substantial endangerment" to the environment and thousands in the lower Yakima Valley who rely on well water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And on Jan. 28, a coalition of groups sued the EPA for what they said is a failure to address air pollution from cattle, hog and poultry farms in California, Wisconsin and Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Pork is cheap and cheap to produce in large factories because they don't pay for cleaning up the Des Moines water supply and they don't pay for the asthma neighbors get, they don't pay for polluting downstream water that used to be potable and they don't pay for the loss of property values," said Steve Wing, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill epidemiologist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>About 68 percent of the nation's lakes, reservoirs and ponds and more than half of its rivers and streams are impaired, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says, meaning they don't meet one or more water-quality standards and are considered too polluted for the intended use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The main culprit: agriculture, including poorly located or poorly managed animal-feeding operations and misapplication of chemicals and fertilizer, EPA reports show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The hog industry's shift from small family farms to large-scale farms is dramatic, going from more than 200,000 in the early 1990s to just over 21,600 in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A driving force behind some of the large-scale hog farms is Murphy-Brown LLC, which became part of the world's largest pork producer when China-based WH Group bought corporate parent Smithfield Foods in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>WH Group aims to feed China's appetite for meat with cheaper hogs from the United States, and that foreshadows increased production in the U.S., according to lawsuits filed in eastern North Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The water- and air-quality lawsuits are mostly driven by advocates of locally grown food as well as animal-rights and environmental activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But in some cases, farmers are going after farmers.</td></tr>

<h3>Here's a look at Islamic State group's reach into North Africa, and potential threat to Europe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Militants in several countries - including Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Yemen and Saudi Arabia - have pledged allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, although the degree of coordination and operational planning between IS leadership and the group's affiliates remains unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- The country has been in free-fall since the end of the civil war that ousted longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Libya's elected government has relocated to the far eastern part of the country, while a loose alliance of militias have set up a rival government in the capital, Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fighting between government forces and Islamic militias rages in the second largest city of Benghazi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, embassies have shuttered and diplomats have fled the country, along with hundreds of thousands of foreign laborers, many of them Egyptian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This chaos has proven fertile ground for IS, which has received pledges of allegiance from several extremist factions in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>IS-affiliated groups divide the vast, oil-rich country of 6 million people into three regions: Tripoli, Barqa or Cyrenaica in the east, and Fazzan in the south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The interior minister of Libya's elected government, Omar al-Sinki, has said that al-Baghdadi appointed a Tunisian named Abu Talha to lead the IS faction in Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Al-Sinki also has said that the bulk of IS militants in Libya are Tunisian and Yemeni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to postings on jihadi web forums, groups claiming allegiance to IS control the coastal cities of Sirte and Darna, and have a presence in at least three other locales, including Tripoli and Benghazi, the birthplace of Libya's 2011 uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Egyptian warplanes struck suspected IS targets in Darna on Monday, following the killing of the 21 Coptic Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Militants claiming allegiance to IS have battled Libyan troops in Benghazi, often using suicide bombers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Last month, fighters loyal to IS claimed responsibility for a deadly and complex attack on a hotel in Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>- The Egyptian government is battling a burgeoning insurgency centered in the strategic Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel and the Gaza Strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>North Sinai has seen a spike in militant attacks against security forces, particularly after the military ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The area has been under a dusk-to-dawn curfew since October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some militants there have declared their allegiance to IS, with one such group calling itself Sinai Province of the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It claimed responsibility for a sophisticated and multi-pronged set of attacks late last month on Egyptian military positions that killed 32 troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Last October, another major attack killed more than 30 troops, and last month Sinai Province militants claimed responsibility for the capture and killing of a police captain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Sinai Province, which grew out of the al-Qaida-inspired group known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, has not attacked civilians directly, although some have died as a result of its violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Extremist groups in Sinai rely heavily on weapons smuggled across the porous desert border with Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Despite more than a year of massive military operations in northern Sinai, which have included home demolitions along the frontier, the government has not been able to stem a daily stream of militant attacks there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>- The Islamic State group's successes in Syria have inspired a number of radical Islamist groups to splinter away from the dominant North African branch of al-Qaida, known as AQIM, and declare allegiance to al-Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Most prominent has been the Algerian Soldiers of the Caliphate (Jund al-Khilafah) led by a veteran al-Qaida commander that kidnapped French hiker Herve Gourdel in September and then put out a video showing his beheading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Algeria unleashed a massive operation against the group last fall, and most of its known members have since been captured or killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In Tunisia, the radical Oqba ibn Nafaa brigade has long had good relations with AQIM, but has also issued statements in support of IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>More importantly, however, there has been a steady flow of Tunisian recruits to al-Baghdadi's group, most passing through Libya for training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Increasingly, they have stayed there and fought with an alliance of Islamist militias as well as the Islamic State, and report have emerged of several Tunisian "martyrs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>WHAT THREAT DOES THIS POSE TO EUROPE?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>- European states have looked on with growing alarm as militants with links to IS have risen in prominence across North Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Italy, which is just 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the Libyan coast, has been perhaps the most concerned by the extremists' surge in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Italian authorities fear that Islamic militants might slip into the country on Libya-based smuggling boats crowded with refugees and migrants from Syria, Africa and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Italian Premier Matteo Renzi has even gone so far as to press for U.N. intervention to stem the violence in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>On Sunday, Italy repatriated by sea its personnel from its Tripoli embassy and advised other Italians, many of whom work in oil or construction businesses, to leave Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Fears about the IS threat are also running high in France, which has seen more people join extremists in Syria and Iraq than any other European country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Some 1,400 French citizens or residents have been identified as linked to jihadi networks in recent years, hundreds of whom have traveled to Syria or Iraq, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>French authorities are particularly concerned that IS-linked extremists will stage attacks at home, and are trying to toughen counterterrorism laws and tools to stop them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>A Frenchman who killed four people at a Paris kosher market last month, Amedy Coulibaly, claimed ties to IS, and the group said last week that Coulibaly's girlfriend has joined IS in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Another Frenchman with ties to IS, Mehdi Nemmouche, is the chief suspect in a deadly attack on the Brussels Jewish Museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>IS in recent months has started a monthly online magazine in French and have released multiple online videos in French urging French Muslims to join jihad in the Mideast - and if they can't, to stage attacks at home.</td></tr>
