<h3>Bali nine lawyers beg Attorney-General to delay transfer to Nusakambangan island</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lawyers for the Bali nine duo on death row have begged the Attorney-General not to transfer the condemned men to Nusakambangan island ahead of a court appearance on February 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The lawyers are challenging President Joko Widodo's rejection of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's clemency pleas in the administrative court in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But despite the legal challenge, the head of Bali's prosecutor's office said on Monday the men would this week be transferred to Nusakambangan island ahead of their execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The men's lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis said it was hard to reverse the transfer to the penal island once they were moved there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"For the sake of justice and fairness, I think it's fair for the Attorney-General to wait for all legal processes to finish," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Mulya said that on Friday the legal team had also sent a letter to the judicial committee regarding allegations by former lawyer Muhammad Rifan that there had been political intervention when the judges imposed the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However a judge involved in the case, Wayan Yasa Abadi, denied there had been political interference or bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said he would respond if summonsed by the judicial committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's legal team is claiming in the administrative court that justice was not served because Mr Joko did not assess the men's clemency pleas individually and take into account their reformation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Instead, the president said all 64 drug felons on death row would be executed due to the drug crisis facing Indonesia, with 50 to 60 people dying as a result of drugs every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>These figures have been criticised for being based on dubious projections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Mulya said he had tried to meet with Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo to request a delay for the transfer but he had been in a meeting with the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have the summons from the administrative court that we have to appear before the head of the administrative court next Tuesday," Mr Mulya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This is the evidence that the legal process is still going on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said he hoped Chan and Sukumaran were not transferred to Nusakambangan island - let alone executed - while the legal process was still underway.</td></tr>
