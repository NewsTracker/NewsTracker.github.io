<h3>All Greek to you? A guide to Greece debt crisis lexicon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>All Greek to you?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A demonstrator shouts slogans as she holds a placard reading 'YES to Greece, Yes to Euro' during a rally organized by supporters of the YES vote to the upcoming referendum in front of the Greek Parliament in Athens, Tuesday, June 30, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>NEW YORK -- Greece's debt crisis has spawned its own awkward argot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For those in the know, clunky terms like "Grexit" are shorthand, a quick way of saving a bundle of words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>For everybody else, they're as mysterious as hieroglyphs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Wall Street types and economists have been wrestling with language to explain Greece's crisis since it started more than five years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>First came the strained metaphors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece, the birthplace of drama, was the setting for a three-act tragedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Now, it seems like every new twist in the story gets the prefix "Gr" slapped on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Social media sites egg the process on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Twitter, a bunch of words crammed together with a hash mark make messages easier to find.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's not the Greek crisis anymore, just (hash)grisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's part of the gallows humor that the financial world is fond of," says Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Sticking a `gr' in front of a word makes it slightly amusing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>GREXIT: Made by combining Greece with exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Used when discussing the possibility that Greece could choose to drop the euro instead of acceding to demands for more budget cuts from its European creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This word is guaranteed to draw at least a few blank looks if said aloud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But it's shorter than saying "Greece's departure from the group of 19 countries that share a single currency, the euro."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>GREXIDENT: An accidental Grexit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A default or a bank run could wind up forcing Greece to quit using the euro, even if it wanted to keep it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>GREFERENDUM: Arguably the silliest of the bunch, created by adding the G from Greece to referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Took off on Twitter, when Greece's prime minister called for the public to vote on the terms offered by the country's lenders in exchange for more loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Greek voters delivered a loud "No" on Sunday, opening up the latest stretch of uncertainty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>GRIMBO: So does that vote mean Greece is going to be in or out of the currency union?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>At the moment, say Citigroup economists, they're sitting somewhere in between.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>And since we're talking about Greece, it's not limbo but "Grimbo."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Good grief.</td></tr>
