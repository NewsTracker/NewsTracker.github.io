<h3>Amazon in talks to buy online luxury retailer Net-a-Porter -Forbes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - Amazon.com is in talks to buy online luxury retailer Net-a-porter in what could be the biggest acquisition yet for the e-commerce giant, but the negotiations are in early stages and could fall apart, Forbes reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The potential deal, first reported by Women's Wear Daily, could value Net-a-Porter lower than the valuation of 2 billion euros ($2.16 billion) reported by the fashion industry trade journal, Forbes reported on Thursday, citing the person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Seattle-based Amazon has long eyed the high-end fashion retail sector and any deal for Net-a-Porter would mean a new commitment in an area where the company lacks a strong presence, Forbes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's Day 1 in the category," Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos told the New York Times in an interview in 2012, saying the company was making a "significant" investment in fashion to convince top brands that it wanted to work with them, not against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Media reports in 2014 said Amazon was in talks to buy Indian fashion retailer Jabong.com for $1.2 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Net-a-Porter is owned by luxury goods group Richemont, which bought the London-based company for 392 million euros in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A spokeswoman for Net-a-Porter said the company does not comment on industry speculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Amazon.com and Richemont could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular business hours.</td></tr>
