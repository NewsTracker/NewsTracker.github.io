<h3>Friend Warned Tamir Rice That Pellet Gun Looked Real</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hours before a 12-year-old boy was fatally shot by a Cleveland police officer, the friend who had loaned Tamir Rice a pellet gun warned him to be careful because it looked real.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Documents released Saturday by the prosecutor handling the racially charged case detail the moments before the brief, deadly encounter - and how the responding officers seemed almost shell-shocked as the boy lay bleeding outside a rec center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department turned over its investigation to the county prosecutor's office on June 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prosecutor Tim McGinty has said the case, as with all police-involved shootings, will be taken to grand jury to determine whether criminal charges should be filed against the officer who shot Tamir, rookie patrolman Timothy Loehmann, or his partner, Frank Garmback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>McGinty said he decided to release the investigative file now in the interests of transparency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If we wait years for all litigation to be completed before the citizens are allowed to know what actually happened, we will have squandered our best opportunity to institute needed changes in use of force policy, police training and leadership," McGinty said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A friend of Tamir told sheriff's deputies he had given the airsoft-type gun to him on the morning of Nov. 22 in exchange for one of the boy's cellphones and planned to get it back later that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The friend told sheriff's deputies he had taken the gun apart to fix it and been unable to reattach the orange cap that goes on the barrel to indicate it isn't the .45-caliber handgun it's modeled after.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Investigators were told that Tamir used the airsoft gun, which shoots non-lethal plastic projectiles, to shoot at car tires that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Loehmann and Garmback were responding to a call about a young man waving and pointing a gun outside the rec center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Grainy, choppy surveillance video shows Loehmann shooting Tamir within two seconds of his police cruiser skidding to a stop near the boy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The video appears to show Tamir reaching for the pellet gun, which is tucked in his waistband, when he's shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Investigative documents said it's been estimated that Loehmann fired twice at a range estimated at between 4-1/2 and 7 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Autopsy records indicate Tamir was struck only once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Loehmann, 26, and Garmback, 47, have been criticized for not giving Tamir first aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The officers seemed to freeze, the agent said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"They wanted to do something, but they didn't know what to do," the agent told investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tamir died on the operating table early the next morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Loehmann's attorney, Henry Hilow, said he has not had a chance to read the investigative file and said the officer committed no wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The agent guessed that Tamir, who was 5-foot-7 and weighed 195 pounds, was an "older teenager."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Police officers at the scene shared the same belief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While Tamir might have been big for his age, those who knew him told investigators that he carried himself like the 12-year-old he was.</td></tr>
