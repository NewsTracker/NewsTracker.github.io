<h3>Slow apps, low battery life limit appeal of Apple Watch-reviewers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The watch, the first new product to be launched by Apple under Chief Executive Tim Cook, will hit stores on April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"For now, the Apple Watch is for pioneers," the Wall Street Journal's Geoffrey Fowler wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I won't pay the $1,000 it would cost for the model I tested, only to see a significant improvement roll in before too long."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Reviews published on Wednesday made much of the device's relatively poor battery life - up to 18 hours, according to Apple - and said its apps will need upgrades to load more quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There's virtually nothing I can't do faster or better with access to a laptop or a phone except perhaps check the time," said Nilay Patel, who reviewed the watch for theverge.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Loading an app required the watch to pull tremendous amounts of data from iPhones, Patel said, adding that Apple had told him upcoming software updates would address performance issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The maps app, surely the answer to wandering pedestrians' dreams, is so slow it makes me want to pull out my paper Rand McNally," the Journal's Fowler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Re/Code's Lauren Goode said the watch's battery life was not nearly as long-lasting as some other wearable devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>CNET's Scott Stein said the battery's recharge time was slow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Paired with an iPhone, the watch allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It also tracks their health - for instance by monitoring heartbeats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But the software is "initially complex" and not suited to tech novices - unusual for an Apple device, said Farhad Manjoo, who reviewed the watch for the New York Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple is among several companies, including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Sony Corp, that hope to jumpstart a market for wearable devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Apple Watch Sport will start at $349, while the high-end "Edition" will be priced from $10,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"...If you can tolerate single-day battery life, half-baked apps and inevitable obsolescence, you can now wear the future on your wrist," Fowler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Analysts at Societe Generale said they expected Apple to sell 8 million watches in 2015, contributing about 1.7 percent or $4 billion to Apple's total sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Apple shares, which were flat on Wednesday, have risen about 24 percent since Apple Watch was announced on Sept.</td></tr>
