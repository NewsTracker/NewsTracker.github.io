<h3>Coroner: Rat raised to feed family's snakes fatally bites baby, who contracts rat-bite fever</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- A rat being raised to feed a family's pet snakes ended up biting a 6-month-old boy and transmitting diseases that killed him, authorities said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An autopsy found that the baby died from meningitis and myocarditis, and a later investigation determined that the infant had been bitten on the finger by a rat, Cumberland County Coroner Charlie Hall said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was difficult determining a cause of death, and lab tests that came back last week showed the baby had rat-bite fever, which caused the meningitis and myocarditis, Hall said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's bizarre," Hall told the York Dispatch newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The infant and the family, who live in Dillsburg, in neighboring York County, were not identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The child was treated at a hospital emergency room Dec. 30 for a fever and a rash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two days later, the lethargic and feverish child was brought back and died in the emergency room, Hall said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Police and child welfare caseworkers were investigating the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hall said he notified child welfare caseworkers because a 3-year-old is among the extended family members who live in the home where the bite occurred, the coroner told the Dispatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Carroll Township Police Chief Tom Wargo said his department was notified last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The parents are cooperating and it is too early in the investigation to know whether charges will be filed, Wargo told the Dispatch.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>While other witnesses reportedly a similarly high casualty figure the numbers were impossible to verify.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>Nigeria's national security spokesman Mike Omeri told AFP he would try to verify the reports while the military could not immediately be reached for comment.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>The Islamist uprising has claimed more than 13,000 lives since 2009 and President Goodluck Jonathan has faced fierce criticism over failure to contain the violence.</td></tr>
