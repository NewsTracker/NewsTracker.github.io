<h3>Ex-attorney general Holder says DOJ could strike a deal with Snowden</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Holder, who stepped down in April, told Yahoo News, "I certainly think there could be a basis for a resolution that everybody could ultimately be satisfied with" to return Snowden from his current asylum in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I think the possibility exists," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Snowden, who has been living in Moscow since June 2013, faces up to 30 years in prison for allegedly stealing and leaking classified information about the U.S. National Security Agency's practice of collecting America's domestic cell phone records.</td></tr>
