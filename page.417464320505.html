<h3>US STOCKS-Wall St set to open lower as Greece weighs; data eyed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>June 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open lower amid uncertainty over the outcome of Greece's negotiations with creditors and ahead of data that could point to the timing of a U.S. rate hike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece must repay four loans totaling 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to the International Monetary Fund this month, starting with a 300 million euro payment on June 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The leaders of Germany, France and Greece's international creditors agreed late on Monday to work with "real intensity" as they try to reach a deal that would prevent a default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The dollar hit a 12 1/2-year high against the yen in Asian trade, before pulling back to trade down against the Japanese currency and the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Stocks have been trying to break out of the narrow trading range but Greece has kept a cap on that," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, which oversees about $1 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Investors will also keep a keen eye on a slew of U.S. economic data due this week for clues on the timing of the Federal Reserve's first rate increase in nearly a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Data due on Tuesday includes April factory orders at 10:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Demand for manufactured goods is likely to have been flat after a strong showing in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The auto industry will report sales for May and analysts expect demand to have been flat or down slightly from last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"If the Fed keeps delaying and doesn't start the process of a rate hike, they are going to lose credibility," said Meckler who reckons that September is the best bet for a hike.</td></tr>
