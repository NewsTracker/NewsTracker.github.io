<h3>US releases military aid to Egypt, cites national security</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama is releasing military aid to Egypt that was suspended after the 2013 coup in that country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The White House says Obama is lifting the hold on sending F-16 fighter jets, tanks and other material to Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The U.S. has been weighing whether to lift the hold to help combat the extremist threat spilling over from Libya and in the Sinai Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the White House says it is not issuing a certification that Egypt has made progress toward democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead, the U.S. is maintaining that the aid is in the interest of U.S. national security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The U.S. had to do one or the other to unblock the aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The funds were suspended 21 months ago when the military overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
