<tr><td>9</td><td>The countries at the center of the Ebola epidemic are forecast to lose 12 percent of their combined gross domestic product this year, according to World Bank estimates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In addition, their health sectors have been partially wiped out by the epidemic, or forced to divert resources to fighting Ebola at the expense of other diseases like measles, malaria and AIDS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The conference's lead participants stressed in their closing statements the "importance of maintaining international engagement with the recovery and development process in the Ebola-affected countries."</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>U.N. Ebola envoy David Nabarro said Monday that the number of new cases had declined from around 900 a week to 100 - but that cases appeared to be climbing back up in the coastal regions of Sierra Leone and Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The conference's lead participants underlined in their concluding statement that "the principal objective is stop all transmission of the virus," but acknowledged much work lay ahead to achieve the goal.</td></tr>
