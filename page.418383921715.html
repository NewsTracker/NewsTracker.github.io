<tr><td>2</td><td>In this year's new format, Chicago Cubs rookie Kris Bryant is in a pairing with the Los Angeles Angels' Albert Pujols, Toronto's Josh Donaldson is in a bracket with the Chicago Cubs' Anthony Rizzo, and Los Angeles Dodgers rookie Joc Pederson takes on Baltimore's Manny Machado.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Players can earn up to 1 minute, 30 seconds of bonus time based on home run distance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''Swinging for five minutes, that's going to be a really long time.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>''I'm probably doing it more for him so he can experience it with me,'' Kris Bryant said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bryant thinks Rizzo may have an advantage at Great American Ball Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''Cincinnati's a pretty good left-handed hitter's ballpark,'' Bryant said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>He will be participating for the sixth time, matching Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa, and trailing only Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire.</td></tr>
