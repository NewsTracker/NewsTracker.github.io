<h3>Israeli leader gets 2-week extension to form coalition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Netanyahu told the Israeli president he has made progress in negotiations with potential partners but needs more time to form a stable coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Israeli leader has held weeks of negotiations with his nationalist, religious and ultra-Orthodox Jewish allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu looks close to finalizing deals with two ultra-Orthodox parties and the centrist, economics-focused Kulanu party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But large gaps remain with two nationalist parties led by long-time Netanyahu associates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israeli President Reuven Rivlin granted Netanyahu the extension Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Under Israeli election rules, if Netanyahu fails to form a coalition after that time, Rivlin can task someone else to do so.</td></tr>
