<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BEIRUT, May 16 (Reuters) - Fighting between Islamic State militants and the Syrian army was reported on Saturday near an ancient citadel in the historic city of Palmyra, the target of a big offensive by the jihadist group that has raised concern for the U.N. world heritage site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that reports on the war, also said Islamic State militants had executed 23 people on Friday including nine minors and five women in areas seized from state control outside the city.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Fighting continued on Saturday but at a lower intensity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Palmyra, also known as Tadmur, is home to extensive ruins of one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Islamic State, which espouses a puritanical Islamist ideology, has destroyed antiquities and ancient monuments in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The government's antiquities chief has said the jihadists will destroy Palmyra's ruins too if they take the area.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>The mass execution reported by the Observatory is the second such killing it has recorded since Islamic State advanced this week into the area.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>The military source said that attack was also repelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Islamic State offensive in central Syria has added to the pressures facing government forces that have faced significant setbacks since late March in the four-year-long war.</td></tr>
