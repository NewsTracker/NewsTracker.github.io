<h3>Searching a racial slur locates White House on Google Maps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google Maps seems to be victim to another internet "prank" involving the White House- this time it's racist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Huffington Post first reported Tuesday that searching "[N-word] House" on Google Maps was bringing some users to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C..</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Racially charged comments about President Obama aren't hard to find on the internet, but this unsettling search result seems to be a new low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Washington Post tested out even more racist search terms after the story broke, and found that multiple racial epithets directed users to the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The app even automatically zoomed in and focused on the building and its grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to The Huffington Post, one man who last month created a custom White House location called "Edwards Snow Den"-meant to put NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden "in the White House"-provided hackers with instructions to create listings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But it seems, until yesterday, it wasn't that hard to create a racist Google Maps location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google Map Maker's support page provided step-by-step instructions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Washington Post reported that Google disabled Map Maker in the wake of the reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Some inappropriate results are surfacing in Google Maps that should not be, and we apologize for any offense this may have caused," Google executives said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Our teams are working to fix this issue quickly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The search term was first brought to light by Howard University alumni in D.C., according to The Huffington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While the original report said that the search result varied by location, searching "N-word House" directed Boston users to the White House as of Wednesday morning.</td></tr>
