<h3>Ukraine official doesn't rule out boycott of 2018 World Cup</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"It's probably the easiest thing to say I favor boycotts," federation president Hrigory Surkis told The Associated Press on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Especially when you can see that there are thousands of civilians who are affected by the situation, where many people have been killed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, Surkis was confident that tensions between Ukraine and Russia would ease before the qualifying draw for the 2018 World Cup is made in St. Petersburg on July 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"If we follow and comply with the Minsk agreements, then there will be no necessity to bring this matter to the agenda," said Surkis, who spoke through an interpreter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko said last week that a boycott "needs to be discussed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He urged European allies not to take part in the sport's marquee event in four years' time as he accuses Russia of sending troops to fight alongside rebels in Ukraine's east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Obviously, this issue is particularly difficult for us," Surkis said of Poroshenko's appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The situation is not only threatening to Ukraine but is also a threat to peace for European societies. Our wish is that in the nearest time, as soon as possible, the situation is stabilized."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Surkis was speaking in the sidelines of the annual UEFA congress, where he was re-elected as an executive committee member of European football's body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Let's wait, let's not be pessimistic," Surkis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I am optimistic because this is not only an issue of peace for Ukraine. It's about peace for whole Europe and for the whole world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter also slammed political interference with football, saying "boycotts have never had any results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Football should be united, sport should be united when it comes to boycotts," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The autonomy of sports must be guaranteed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Following Russia's annexation of the Crimea region from Ukraine a year ago, UEFA decided to separate their national and clubs teams in all competition draws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A ceasefire negotiated last month in Minsk has calmed the conflict in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian separatists, prompting UEFA's top official overseeing football in Crimea to suggest the block could be lifted for the 2016 European Championship in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>UEFA executive committee member Frantisek Laurinec of Slovakia said the two countries could play "in a neutral field like in France."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Surkis said he "would like that all bans of this kind, like they also exist between Armenia and Azerbaijan, stop dominating the football world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"But we must understand that there is a danger of acts of violence many times," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"My colleagues, the ExCo members, have taken the most correct decision for a certain period of time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Euro 2016 finals draw takes place on Dec. 12, and though Laurinec didn't refer to club football, the issue might become urgent for UEFA much sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Europa League could be heading toward a Ukrainian-Russian final as Dynamo Kiev and Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk of Ukraine, along with Dynamo Moscow, are among the eight teams left in the competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Although clubs from the two countries are being kept apart, UEFA secretary general Gianni Infantino indicated that an exception would be made for a final between Dynamo and a Ukrainian side " if the two clubs made it through to the decider on May 27 in Warsaw, Poland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"If they reach the final, they play the final," said Infantino, adding that lifting the block in general was not yet an option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It's premature to think about other possibilities," he said.</td></tr>
