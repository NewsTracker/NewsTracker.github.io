<h3>Islamic State executes Ethiopian Christians in Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Islamic State jihadist group on Sunday released a video purportedly showing the executions of some 30 Ethiopian Christians captured in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 29-minute video purports to show militants holding two groups of captives, described in a text on the screen as "followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A masked fighter in black brandishing a pistol makes a statement threatening Christians if they do not convert to Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The video then switches between footage of one group of about 12 men being beheaded by militants on a beach and another group of at least 16 being shot in the head in a desert area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was not immediately clear who the captives were or exactly how many were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Before the killings, the video shows purported footage of Christians in Syria explaining how they had been given the choice of converting to Islam or paying a special tax, and had decided to pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The video bore the logo of IS's media arm and was similar to footage released in the past, including of a group of 21 Coptic Christians, mainly Egyptians, beheaded on a Libyan beach in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Several Libyan jihadist groups have pledged allegiance to IS, the extremist organisation that has seized control of large parts of Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
