<h3>Facebook Begins Hosting News Articles From Nine Publishers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook will host articles from nine media organizations on its mobile app starting Wednesday as part of an experiment that offers attractive terms for publishers, but also risks deepening their reliance on the social network for traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The New York Times , National Geographic, BuzzFeed, NBC, The Atlantic, The Guardian, BBC News, Spiegel and Bild are Facebook's initial partners in the program, dubbed Instant Articles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Talks between Facebook and publishers began last year with some, including The Wall Street Journal, adopting a more cautious approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Facebook said it will allow publishers to sell ads in their articles and keep all of the revenue, an arrangement earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Publishers can sell excess ad inventory through Facebook's advertising network and keep 70% of the revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Instant Articles will let publishers "deliver fast, interactive articles while maintaining control of their content and business models," said Facebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook has about double the user engagement of other social networks, Barclays analysts said in a note Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Late last year, Facebook eclipsed Google as the leading referrer of traffic to news sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some sites say Facebook accounts for as much as 70% of their traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Many publishers hope Facebook can help them better tap into the fast-growing mobile advertising market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A recent Pew Research Center study found that 39 out of 50 news sites now have more traffic coming from mobile users than from desktop users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under the initiative Facebook will be able to load and display news articles ten times faster than the current norm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Web articles take an average of eight seconds to load on smart phones, making news one of the slowest aspects of the social network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Get breaking news and personal-tech reviews delivered right to your inbox.</td></tr>
