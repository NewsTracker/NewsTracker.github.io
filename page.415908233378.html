<h3>10 Ebola cases found during Sierra Leone's shutdown</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sierra Leone found 10 new Ebola cases during a three-day countrywide shutdown, an official said Wednesday, declaring that the West African country is now at the "tail end" of the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hundreds of sick people were identified on Friday, Saturday and Sunday as health teams went door-to-door in an operation that also aimed to remind people how to prevent Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But only 10 of those people eventually tested positive for the disease, said Alfred Palo Conteh, the head of the country's Ebola response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That figure indicates that there were not hordes of hidden Ebola cases as some had feared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>By contrast, during a shutdown in September, when the epidemic was raging, more than 260 new cases were found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Conteh said Sierra Leone had "conquered the Ebola disease and we are now at the tail end."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But others have cautioned that there is still much to be done to get rid of the disease in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In fact, the three-day shutdown was meant to remind people that the outbreak is not over and to fight complacency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed around 10,500 people, the vast majority in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.</td></tr>
