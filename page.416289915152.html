<h3>Pharmacy expert: Problem with Georgia execution drug caused by storage at low temperature</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>State officials on March 2 called off the scheduled execution of Kelly Renee Gissendaner, saying the lethal injection drug they intended to use appeared "cloudy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The state Department of Corrections on Thursday released lab reports, a sworn statement from a pharmaceutical expert hired by the state and a short video showing a syringe of clear liquid with chunks of a white solid floating in the solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gissendaner's attorneys did not have a comment on the analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gissendaner would have been the first woman executed by the state in 70 years.</td></tr>
