<h3>FIFA insists Russia, Qatar bids were fairly awarded in 2010</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sepp Blatter effectively sacked himself Tuesday, announcing his plans to resign the FIFA presidency he's held since 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The locations of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively, will remain unchanged - at least for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Just two days after Domenico Scala, chairman of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, claimed that those selections could be vacated if evidence of bribery was brought forth, FIFA refuted that assertion with a statement defending the bid process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Russia and Qatar were awarded the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups by democratic vote of the Executive Committee," FIFA said in a statement on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Based on expert opinions and available facts, FIFA has no legal grounds to take away the hosting of the FIFA World Cup from Russia and Qatar."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rumors have swirled about possible corruption in those voting proceedings ever since FIFA's executive committee selected Russia and Qatar - a nation with no world soccer experience - for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments back in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many of those suspicions were only compounded following the arrest of nine high-ranking FIFA officials on charges of corruption, money-laundering, and racketeering last week; it has since been reported that FIFA procured a $10 million bribe from South Africa before that nation was chosen to host the World Cup in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Both nations have remained steadfast in their denials of any corruption or bribery, with the chief of Russia's World Cup organizing committee, Alexey Sorokin, insisting "it (the vote) was clean" in an interview with CNN last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It didn't transgress any FIFA practices, any practices applicable to the bidding process," Sorokin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both Russia and Qatar have maintained the allegations have not affected their preparations for the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The FBI continues to investigate the selection of the two host nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>FIFA might have already officially chosen host nations for next two World Cups, but on Sunday evening the man charged with overseeing the organization's reform made it clear those decisions wouldn't necessarily be final if evidence of foul-play comes to light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 2018 and 2022 tournaments are currently set to be played in Russia and Qatar, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If evidence should emerge that the awards to Qatar and Russia only came about thanks to bought votes then the awards could be invalidated," Domenico Scala, chairman of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, said in an interview with Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Scala, who was chosen last week to superintend the organization's period of reform in the midst of its ever-growing scandal, also made it clear to the Swiss news outlet that no such evidence has yet emerged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The comments come shortly after the FBI announced that it would expand its investigation into worldwide corruption in soccer to include the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and the processes that led to their selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While no evidence of bribery has been brought to light yet, former FIFA executive Chuck Blazer made it clear in his testimony to federal officials that the votes of other high-ranking FIFA officials had been bought for past World Cups, including the 2010 tournament in South Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The South African government has categorically denied that any bribery took place in that process, and Russia followed suit on Sunday by emphatically defending its selection by FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It was clean," chief of Russia's 2018 organizing committee Alexey Sorokin told CNN last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It didn't transgress any FIFA practices, any practices applicable to the bidding process. What else can we say?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Looks like releasing a movie about the origins of an ultimatley corrupt and shady organization in the country that brought it down turned out to be a bad idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Who knew?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>FIFA-funded flick "United Passions" bombed in its United States release this weekend according to the Hollywood Reporter, netting just $607 on Friday and Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The low point?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>One theatre in Phoenix reported making $9 - the price of a single ticket - on the film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Disgraced FIFA president Sepp Blatter is played by Tim Roth in writer-director Frederic Auburtin's film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The movie was originally released overseas in 2014 and holds just a 2.6 rating (out of 10) on IMDb.com, mostly dismissed as a propaganda, according to reviewers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Former FIFA vice president Jack Warner used money sent on behalf of South Africa for cash withdrawals, personal loans and to launder money, according to documents, the BBC reports in its investigation on what happened to the $10 million sent to FIFA accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Warner, 72, who has been indicted for corruption, denies wrongdoing, as does South Africa's Football Association.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The money was meant to be used for South Africa's diaspora legacy program to develop soccer in the Caribbean, but documents show how the money was spent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>(AP) - A global sports organization pummeled by a corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The president under pressure to resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The U.S. Justice Department and FBI leading the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Sponsors clamoring for reform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>FIFA in 2015?</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>This was the crisis facing the International Olympic Committee in the late 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The IOC, however, managed to move quickly to clean itself up and enact reforms that helped restore credibility and confidence in the Olympic body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Now, the IOC is being held as a model for FIFA to follow as its tries to dig itself out of the biggest bribery scandal in its 111-year history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>According to the man who helped lead the IOC cleanup, it will be a much more difficult challenge for soccer's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"It's a complete and utter mess," senior IOC member Dick Pound told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"It may be too late."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Pound, a Canadian lawyer, headed the internal investigation into the bribery allegations that rocked the IOC to its foundations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The case, which broke in December 1998, centered on the cash, scholarships, medical care, lavish gifts and other favors linked to Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>According to a report from Spain's El Mundo newspaper, Sepp Blatter and Irina Shayk were "lovers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Yes, that Irina Shayk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The supermodel and Cristiano Ronaldo's ex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Getting this little item planted in the Spanish press show's just how powerful the outgoing FIFA boss is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>South Africa's former president signed off on the $10 million the country sent to FIFA in 2007, the nation's sports minister said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>While South Africa is denying that it was part of a bribe to bring the 2010 World Cup to the continent for the first time, sports minister Fikile Mbalula told a local newspaper on Friday that the payment was approved after then-President Thabo Mbeki spoke with the leaders of the 2010 World Cup local organizing committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"(It was) the government's idea," Mbalula told South African news outlet Beeld, according to the BBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Mbeki has denied any bribery took place since the scandal broke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"I wish to state that the government that I had the privilege to lead would never have paid any bribe even if it were solicited," Mbeki said in a statement last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The South African government insists was made to CONCACAF to develop soccer in the Caribbean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>(AP) - The president of the influential German soccer federation, Wolfgang Niersbach, says a new FIFA president needs to be elected sooner rather than later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"For me it's incredible the way it happened. You (Sepp Blatter) invite the whole world to a congress, you get re-elected and then four days later you resign, for whatever reason, but it's not an immediate resignation," Niersbach told German TV station ZDF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>FIFA said four months are needed to set up the extraordinary congress to elect the new president but Niersbach said "everything needs to go much faster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Another day, another FIFA bribe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>On Thursday morning it was reported that the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) accepted a bribe from FIFA totaling more than $5.6 million to not proceed with a legal case following a pivotal Thierry Henry handball in a 2009 World Cup qualifier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>The handball, which went uncalled, opened the door for a winning French goal and ultimately cost Ireland a spot in the 2010 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>FAI chief executive John Delaney admitted to the bribe in an interview with Irish radio outlet RTE on Thursday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>"We felt we had a legal case against FIFA because of how the World Cup playoff hadn't worked out for us with the Henry handball," Delaney told RTE.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>"We came to an agreement. That was a Thursday and on Monday the agreement was all signed and all done. It's a very good agreement for the FAI and a very legitimate agreement for the FAI."</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>When asked how big the bribe was, Delaney told RTE that the agreement barred him from mentioning the exact figure involved but didn't object when the interviewer claimed it was $5.6 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>"You used a figure there," said Delaney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>"Well done to you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>BREAKING: Sepp Blatter says he has started work on reforming FIFA amid corruption crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>(AP) - The British government says England is ready to step in and host the 2022 World Cup if the tournament is stripped from Qatar amid the corruption scandal engulfing FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>"Obviously if FIFA came forward and asked us to consider hosting it, we have the facilities in this country and of course we did mount a very impressive, if unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 World Cup," culture secretary John Whittingdale told the House of Commons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>However, Whittingdale acknowledged that "it does seem very unlikely that another European country would host it in 2022" because Russia is due to stage the World Cup in 2018.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Swiss authorities are investigating the bidding contests for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments, and have seized documents at FIFA headquarters as part of their corruption probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>(Reuters) - The FBI's investigation of soccer governing body FIFA includes scrutiny of how the organization awarded the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 competition to Qatar, a U.S. law enforcement official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the review of the awards to host the tournament would be part of a probe that is looking beyond the allegations in an indictment announced a week ago of officials of world soccer's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Swiss prosecutors said then that they were investigating the 2018 and 2022 bids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Among issues the FBI is examining is the stewardship of FIFA by its longtime president Sepp Blatter, who on Tuesday unexpectedly announced his plan to resign.</td></tr>
