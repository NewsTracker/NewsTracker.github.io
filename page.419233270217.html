<h3>The ABCs of Google's new name Alphabet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - What's in a name?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Most corporate naming experts say Google's decision to reorganize its businesses under a new holding company called "Alphabet" is close to letter perfect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Because it is part of Google's corporate structure, Alphabet is not likely to become part of the lexicon like "Googling" did; it will mainly be used on Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the name Alphabet itself is simple and fits with Google's reputation as being "user friendly and elementary," says Tom Sepanski, naming and verbal identity director of branding firm Landor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Something about it is so fundamental," adds Sagi Haviv, a partner at identity firm Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's a metaphor, just like any word can be created out of the alphabet, any concept can be realized."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The move by Google highlights how important corporate names are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google joins a long line of companies that have created quirky, confusing and sometimes hard-to-pronounce company names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Creating a corporate name - or changing it - is a delicate balance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A good name must convey what the company stands for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It should be catchy, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But sometimes creative names backfire: When Kraft Foods spun off its snack food division and named it Mondelez in 2012, for instance, the reaction was not enthusiastic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The New York Post ran a headline that simply asked: "MONDEWHAAAT?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Other times, boring names are met with criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When HP named its research division Agilent in 1999, some critics deemed it too lackluster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Most naming experts agree that Google struck the right balance with Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We think about a name as a first word in a story but not the whole story," said Nikolas Contis, global director of naming and branding firm Siegel+Gale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"In each case, it's what's the simple idea expressed through surprising language."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Nikolas Contis, global director of naming and branding firm Siegel + Gale, said Alphabet ranks up there with Apple and Amazon and more recently, Uber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They infuse a simple word with key brand attributes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Amazon's name, for example, helped convey the company's aggressive growth plans from an online bookseller into an e-commerce powerhouse that could expand into everything from drones to cloud services, Contis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It was utterly simple and very strategic," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>More recently, the name of ride-sharing app Uber - which basically means a supreme version of something - helped people understand that the company was trying to reinvent the taxi business, Contis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The best names explode conventions and create new references points," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Google is staying mum about how they came up with the name, but CEO Larry Page explained key reasoning in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We also like that it means alpha-bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Because the word is a commonly used word, Google likely invested heavily in it, i.e. buying licenses or companies with relevant trademarks, said Landor's Sepanski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Although some companies and brands can exist with the same name (think Dove soap and Dove chocolate), the simpler the name, the more likely that someone owns the trademark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"It was probably a very expensive name," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Most real-world names are taken. It's hard for me to believe they could register the trademark without a lot of money trading hands behind the scenes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In the end, the name works because it fits in with Google's brand, said David Placek, founder of Lexicon Branding in Sausalito, California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Something as fun and simple as alphabet works for them," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"If Bank of America created a holding company called Alphabet, I think it would be met with good deal of skepticism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Google says the new holding company will provide an umbrella for its separate divisions like Nest, which makes Internet-connected home appliances, and Calico, which is conducting cutting-edge health research, more independence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The segmentation of Google divisions under the Alphabet banner helps the name fit too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"They probably did need a holding company to open things up, and show what they're doing and where they're spending money," Placek said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"So they're getting a positive reception based on that, and also people just like the name."</td></tr>
