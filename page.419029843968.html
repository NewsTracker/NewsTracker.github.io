<h3>Blue Jays, Royals escalate feud by trading barbs on Twitter (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TORONTO (AP) -- The Royals and Blue Jays have moved on: After an exchange of hit batters, they're now trading barbs on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>First, Blue Jays slugger Jose Bautista posted a message Sunday night saying he had ''lost a lot of respect'' for Ned Yost after hearing the Royals manager praise home plate umpire Jim Wolf's handling of Sunday's game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two Blue Jays batters were hit by pitches and reliever Aaron Sanchez was ejected for retaliating by hitting Kansas City infielder Alcides Escobar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That prompted Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura to post Tweets calling Bautista a ''nobody'' and accuse him of stealing signs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ventura later deleted the messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bautista took the high road when asked to respond to Ventura's comments Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''He's a young player that could use some maturing,'' Bautista said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Wold warned both benches after Royals pitcher Edinson Volquez hit Toronto's Josh Donaldson in the first inning of Sunday's game, a 5-2 Blue Jays win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Donaldson complained to Wolf after Volquez and reliever Ryan Madson missed high and inside later in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Madson also hit Toronto's Troy Tulowitzki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Neither pitcher was ejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Wolf ejected Sanchez after Escobar was hit on the thigh in the eighth, causing both benches and both bullpens to empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Blue Jays manager John Gibbons, who had been ejected earlier for arguing with Wolf, returned to the field for the melee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>No punches were thrown.</td></tr>
