<h3>Serena wins 8th Key Biscayne title by beating Suarez Navarro (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Serena Williams won her eighth Key Biscayne title Saturday and remained unbeaten this year by drubbing Carla Suarez Navarro 6-2, 6-0 in the final of the Miami Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Williams became the fourth woman to win the same WTA event at least eight times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Martina Navratilova won Chicago 12 times, the most titles by a woman at any tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Navratilova was on hand to present the top-ranked Williams with her latest trophy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Williams claimed her second title this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She won her 19th Grand Slam championship at the Australian Open in January, and has now won 12 consecutive finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Williams improved to 18-0 this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She withdrew before the Indian Wells semifinal last month with a knee injury but quickly recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Williams was erratic at times as she navigated this year's draw, and was jeered for angrily pounding the court with her racket in an early-round match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the sun-splashed crowd was firmly behind her in the final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A roar erupted when she entered the stadium, and she had them cheering her winners from the first point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Suarez Navarro looked nervous, and while she managed to hold in her first two service games, Williams pulled away from there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Williams' grunts grew louder as she closed out the first set, and she won the final 10 games, including 25 of 30 points in the second set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mixing pace and direction, Williams won 21 of 22 points on her first serve, and she totaled 29 winners to three for Suarez Navarro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Williams won with more than power, coming forward to put away a volley on the first point, hitting delicate slice backhands and giving Suarez Navarro fits with her slice serve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Williams' demeanor was subdued for most of the match, which was 30 minutes old before her first fist pump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But she wore a big grin as she accepted the championship trophy from Navratilova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Williams improved to 5-0 against Suarez Navarro and has lost a total of 12 games in those matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Now 73-7 at Key Biscayne, Williams has won her past 18 matches in the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She considers it her home event because she lives 90 minutes up Interstate 95 in Palm Beach Gardens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She has gone home with the championship trophy eight of the 15 times she has entered, with her first title in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The 26-year-old Suarez Navarro was playing in the biggest final of her career, and she'll crack the top 10 next week for the first time.</td></tr>
