<h3>US Puts 2 Greek Far-Left Militants on Terror Blacklist</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Obama administration placed two Greek far-left militants on a terrorism blacklist Tuesday amid concerns that a third could soon be released from prison to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The State Department on Tuesday added Christodoulos Xiros and Nikolaos Maziotis to the blacklist that freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It also prohibits Americans from any transactions with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Xiros was a member of the November 17 group that killed more than 20 people, including Americans, between 1975 and 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Maziotis is the leader of Revolutionary Struggle, a group held responsible for a 2007 grenade attack on the U.S. Embassy in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The designations come as Washington has complained that another November 17 member, Savvas Xiros, may complete his prison term under home confinement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Xiros, who is disabled, could benefit from new Greek legislation that would allow him to serve the remainder of his five life sentences under home confinement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Savvas Xiros, a member of the Marxist-nationalist November 17 group, lost most of his sight and hearing when a bomb exploded in his hands in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The explosion led to his arrest and the dismantling of the group, which killed 23 people between 1975 and 2000, including U.S., British and Turkish nationals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>U.S. Ambassador David Pearce said Monday that allowing Xiros, 53, to leave prison would be regarded by the U.S. as "a profoundly unfriendly act" and that the new Greek law is "inconsistent" with the good partnership between the two NATO allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The issue was discussed Monday during talks in Washington between Secretary of State John Kerry and Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kotzias, in an interview with The Associated Press Tuesday, said that if Xiros seeks a change of confinement under the new law, the request would have to be approved by a Greek court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Moreover, Kotzias said he told Kerry that Greece would seek U.S. cooperation to obtain technology for a house arrest ankle bracelet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kotzias said the new law was a response to a European court of human rights decision criticizing conditions in Greek prisons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"So the government, after the decision of the European court of human rights, took the humanitarian decision that people who have an 80 percent disability or more can go to other forms of being prisoners," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Savvas Xiros, blind and suffering from multiple sclerosis, is 98 percent disabled, Kotzias said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greek opposition parties and relatives of November 17's victims have also strongly protested the new law.</td></tr>
