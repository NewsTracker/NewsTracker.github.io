<h3>Greece makes huge claim for Nazi era</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Greek government says Germany owes Greece nearly ?279bn (?204bn; $303bn) in war reparations for the Nazi occupation during World War Two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It is the first time Greece has officially calculated what Germany allegedly owes it for Nazi atrocities and looting during the 1940s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, the German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece's radical left Syriza government is making the claim while struggling to meet massive debt repayment deadlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Reacting to the Greek claim, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said it was "dumb" to link Greece's bailout by the eurozone with the question of war reparations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"To be honest I think it's dumb. I think that it doesn't move us forward one millimetre on the question of stabilising Greece," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said ordinary Greek citizens however deserved "huge respect" for their economic sacrifices under the bailout programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Greek elite had "plundered" the country, he complained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The new figure given by Greek Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas includes ?10.3bn for an occupation loan that the Nazis forced the Bank of Greece to pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros," Mr Mardas told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece's debt crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece's state general accounting office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Berlin paid 115m Deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation - a fraction of the Greek demand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Greece says it did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990, before Germany reunified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The budget spokesman for Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democrats, Eckhardt Rehberg, reiterated on Tuesday that "the reparations issue is for us closed, politically and legally - the same applies to the so-called forced loan".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for Greek citizens' hardship under the austerity imposed by international lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Tsipras is trying to renegotiate the ?240bn EU-IMF bailout that saved Greece from bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Greece has not received bailout funds since August last year, as the lenders are dissatisfied with the pace of Greek reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A Greek repayment of ?448m to the International Monetary Fund is due this Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis has said that Greece "intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum".</td></tr>
