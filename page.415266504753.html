<h3>Will the Apple Watch finally move the needle in the smartwatch industry? Here's why & why not</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO - No one can argue that Apple has changed the way people live their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company's iPod, iTunes, iPhone and iPad have shaken up music, phone and computer markets worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Is the Apple Watch going to be able to do the same?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The stakes are big for Apple CEO Tim Cook: the watch is the first brand-new Apple product to be launched without legendary co-founder Steve Jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the market is awash in smartwatches that have gained little traction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Here are three reasons the Apple Watch will finally move the needle in the smartwatch industry - and three reasons it might not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>MORE FEATURES THAN RIVALS: Along with email, texts and phone calls, Apple says its watch will present news, health readings and other notifications in creative ways that can be read at a glance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It will have a heart rate monitor and accelerometer, and an internal motor that can signal the wearer with a subtle "tap" on the wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And Siri and Apple Pay will be built in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple is working with outside companies to create more apps; Cook has talked about using the watch as an electronic "key" for hotel doors or even cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A POWERFUL BRAND: The world's biggest tech company has a reputation for quality and a direct conduit to customers - it operates more than 400 retail stores around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And it has deep pockets to spend on advertising - it is showcasing the watch this month with a sleek, 12-page insert in Vogue and other fashion magazines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>APPLE'S TRACK RECORD: This wouldn't be the first Apple product that revolutionized a market where rivals had struggled to break through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Other companies made digital music players before the iPod, smartphones before the iPhone and even tablets before the iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most of those products failed to catch on until Apple made devices so appealing they set new standards and created new demand, said Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>WHAT'S THE NEED?: Most smartwatches - including Apple's - only work with a smartphone nearby, so you can't swap one expensive gadget for the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"What we've seen is that it's not obvious why people would want a smartwatch," says Gownder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A recent Forrester survey found some respondents didn't see a reason to buy one because they already owned a less-expensive fitness band or a full-featured smartphone (although it also found Apple fans ready to buy the new watch).</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>CONSUMERS NOT EXCITED: You can already buy smartwatches made by giant tech companies like Samsung, Sony or LG, or from a tech startup like Pebble, that track your heart rate, show you email and deliver other online services to your wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>None of them have really caught on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Only about 5 million smartwatches were sold worldwide last year, according to market researchers at Strategy Analytics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>By comparison, Apple sold 74.6 million iPhones in just the last quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>PRICE AND OBSOLESCENCE: Many of today's smartwatches sell for $200 or less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Apple plans to sell three models, starting at $349, but Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster predicts the average buyer will pay $550 for a watch and extra, interchangeable bands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Apple's high-fashion "Edition" model, made with 18-karat gold, is expected to cost thousands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>While affluent consumers might pay that for a watch they can wear for years, or even hand down to their children, it's a lot of money for something that could become outdated if Apple releases a new model every year or so - as it does with smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Cook will make his case for the Apple Watch at a press event Monday, where he's expected to show off more features and apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Expectations are high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But even the iPhone didn't become a mainstream blockbuster in its first year, notes Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Of the Apple Watch, he says, "people need to understand more about what this product is, and what it does, and I think that will evolve over time."</td></tr>
