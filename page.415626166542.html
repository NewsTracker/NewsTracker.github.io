<h3>After Cyclone Pam, Vanuatu's people revive, rebuild and, in some cases, rethink</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>She's now living with two other staff members in the only classroom that's still habitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And she's running low on the rice she had before Cyclone Pam tore through Vanuatu a week ago, upending her life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Uhi is moving forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She's helped organize a community cleanup of the Manua Centre School grounds on the main island of Efate on Monday, and is determined that her 314 students will return to school as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A week after the cyclone tore through the South Pacific archipelago with winds of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour, people are focused on the task of rebuilding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The signs of progress are everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The road that rings the main island is now accessible to all vehicles following temporary repairs to bridges, and the cell network that's vital to keeping people connected is gradually being restored on Efate and some other islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On the sides of roads, crews have been repairing electricity lines and residents cutting tree trunks into fire-sized slices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The task remains enormous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Many of the outlying islands still don't have any way to communicate with the outside world, while tourism, vital to the economy, has taken a huge hit, with many operators fielding call after call to cancel bookings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Throughout Vanuatu, many people remain worried about the most basic necessities: water, shelter and food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>About 65,000 people across Vanuatu were left homeless by the cyclone, which killed 17 people, said Osnat Lubrani, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Vanuatu and other small island nations face unique challenges in recovery due to their remote location and scattered populations, Lubrani said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Delivering services even when there isn't a crisis is hard and expensive, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"So certainly in a time of disaster, that makes things very difficult," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"On the positive side, I think people are extremely resilient."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Lubrani said the total price tag for the rebuild is still unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Neighbors New Zealand and Australia quickly committed millions of dollars toward the relief effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There's also been millions more committed by other countries, including France, the U.S., the United Arab Emirates and South Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Relief agencies are also moving enormous resources into the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But for people like Uhi, the school principal, the response can't come quick enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She's been given some tents by World Vision, but needs much more help, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mothers have been coming by every day to ask when their children can return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"There's a little bit of heartbreak," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I really want the children to be able to go back to school."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The government has canceled all classes across the nation until March 30, although there's no guarantee the Manua school will be ready to open then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>For many people, small improvements are noticeable each day, whether in their living situation or their health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>At the main hospital in Port Vila, the capital, George Palap has been watching the progress of his 1-year-old nephew, Moses Sam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The family was on Tanna island when the cyclone struck in the early morning of March 14 and tore apart their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>They ran for some nearby caves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Palap's sister Sampat, who was holding her infant, stumbled in the ferocious winds, he said, and the boy's head smacked into the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The family made it to the caves, but Moses's wound was serious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Palap said his head swelled to twice its normal size and became infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Red Cross arrived by helicopter and took the boy to Tanna's airport, where he was flown to Port Vila, his uncle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The swelling has now gone down and Moses is doing much better, Palap said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>There doesn't appear to be any permanent damage and the family hopes he can leave the hospital next week, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>For others, the cyclone has delivered an opportunity to make changes.</td></tr>

<h3>No 1 Bootcamp in Ibiza attracts Spencer Matthews and other celebrities</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yes, it seems the secret to his rock-hard abs and enviable tan is impossible runs up the mountains of the White Isle, where he is doing anything but partying into the wee small hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>I have signed up to No1 Bootcamp, the retreat tucked into a beautiful sprawling farmhouse near the coastal town of Santa Eulalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It is famed as the bootcamp to the stars (alumni include X-Factor contestants, model Calum Best and former Atomic Kitten Natasha Hamilton).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And as if to prove a point, the indomitable Made in Chelsea stalwart turns up unannounced on my first day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>We're a nervous bunch at 7am as we stand in our lycra waiting to meet Andy Morris - a former personal training instructor in the RAF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>We had all arrived at different times the day before, dropped off at this picture-perfect villa Casona Morna, where its fragrant gardens give way to a beautiful pool and an outdoor seating area makes the perfect spot for al fresco lunch and dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Just down the road is the beach - where Andy hosts classes when he feels we need a change of scene - and all around are rolling hills criss-crossed by hiking routes which we explore in the afternoons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A bundle of energy with the essential booming voice that every instructor needs, Andy has us all weighed, measured and taking part in a basic series of exercises as an introductory fitness test before we have even had breakfast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>When we do eventually sit down my serving of porridge looks decidedly small as he talks us through the week - 7am intensive workouts for 20 minutes, three-hour hikes, swimming pool-based activities, boxing classes, team games and endurance work-outs on the beach are just some of the highlights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And we'll be doing all this while on a severely calorie-controlled diet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Our amazing chef and nutritionist Kate will be serving up three meals a day and snacks, but it will all be sugar, gluten and dairy-free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>My stomach rumbles in sympathy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As it turns out, the food is delicious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For the first 48 hours I feel hungry and have a slight headache - all part of the detox process apparently - but soon enough I start feeling fulfilled by the meals and we certainly have a great mix of foods, from hamburgers and 'chips' (sweet potato) to fish, salad, stuffed peppers and frittata.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There are 13 of us in my group and we create a whole spectrum of shapes and sizes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Of the four men, Spencer is at the fitter end of the scale, while others admit they work long hours and don't have the chance to work out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Among us females we have everything from a professional stunt woman looking to hone her shape, to a slim girl who just wants to get fitter and an overweight woman who is keen to kick-start her weight-loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The rest of us could just do with losing a few pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Thankfully, the variety means we're not pitted against each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Andy is quick to tell us we are only competing with ourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Some of us excel during the running and endurance training, others are great when it comes to weights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>I learn an entirely new workout vocabulary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It's all about maintaining form (basically, making sure you do the exercises properly and don't do yourself a mischief).</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>We interchange High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT - where you blast through exercises with 100 per cent, but it's all over quite quickly) with isometric training (strength training focusing on one muscle or group of muscles).</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Despite the somewhat alien terminology, we're all soon using the jargon and Andy takes care to explain exactly what each class is doing for our bodies and why it is perfectly balanced with the previous exercise circuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Don't be fooled though, he's not all friendly and cuddly - don't let him catch you slacking off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Thankfully, it's not all high-octane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Between classes we're given time to recover, some people swim, others sunbathe and I drag my bruised and battered body into the shade for a nap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>By day three I am pretty sure my body is about to give up on me altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Walking up the 10 stairs to my bedroom (there is a choice of sharing rooms or having one to yourself) takes about five minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Even rolling over in bed sends shooting pains through my muscles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But somehow in each class I manage to find myself working through the exercises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Perhaps Andy terrifies my muscles into submission, but by the end of day three they suddenly start easing up again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>This is helped in no small part by a massage booked with local therapists who come to the villa for bookings (it is the best 70 I have ever spent).</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Throughout my personal ups and downs, Spencer remains irritatingly energetic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He is the first to finish exercises, the fastest runner and the most likely to whip off his top in the heat (well, it is a female-dominated group and he has ladies to impress - even the red and sweaty ones).</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>A TYPICAL BOOTCAMP DAY...</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Which is how I find myself being overtaken by the Chelsea resident while tackling a particularly steep hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>We are on one of our final hikes, a favourite activity of mine which allows us to ramble all over the countryside, taking in sea views from clifftops and clambering through forest paths, with the intense smell of pine trees all around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Our final hike ends with a devastatingly steep road which Andy has the bright idea of making us run up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>We take off full of enthusiasm, round a corner and see that it seemingly goes on forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Chest heaving, muscles straining and mentally making a note to kill our instructor, I haul myself up, only for Spencer to come bounding past, giving a thumbs up to the camera (Andy also loves nothing more than filming his victims - I mean participants - for a surprisingly touching montage to be shown at the end of the week).</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>At the top there are high fives all-round, shout-outs to those bringing up the rear and even a few sweaty hugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>For our final night, we're allowed 'off-campus' and into town for a dinner of our choice and even a sneaky glass of wine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>But Kate and Andy have cleverly organised it so that our final weigh-in is the following morning, so we're desperate not to over-indulge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Despite the concentration of bootcamp on exercise and healthy lifestyles, we haven't been weighed in since our first day and there is little talk of 'diets' and body comparisons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Everyone just seems to get on with doing their best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>So what's the verdict?</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Spencer loses a reasonable seven pounds this time around (he has previously lost a stone in one trip), our 'biggest loser' sheds an amazing 11 pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Quite a few hover around the seven pounds mark and I lose four, which isn't too bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Kate reminds us that we will probably go on losing a couple of pounds the following week and I find that actually, it's not the weight I'm worried about so much anymore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>My arms feel more defined, I feel lighter in myself and my body feels less sluggish thanks to the leaner diet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>To me that is much more valuable than a few lost pounds.</td></tr>
