<h3>Keith scores as Blackhawks beat Predators 4-3 in double OT (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- The Chicago Blackhawks could not have started worse giving up three goals on the first 12 shots, forcing coach Joel Quenneville to yank goalie Corey Crawford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Scott Darling came off the bench and made his postseason debut a game to remember.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Darling stopped all 42 shots he faced, and Duncan Keith scored at 7:49 of double overtime helping the Chicago Blackhawks rally and beat the Nashville Predators 4-3 Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It was a great opportunity for him, and he seized the moment ...'' Quenneville said of Darling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Blackhawks finished only two points back of Nashville in the Central Division, and they grabbed home-ice advantage back despite benching Crawford after the first period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Darling had played only 14 NHL games, but he stopped every subsequent shot as Nashville took 54 - a franchise record for the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Not bad for someone who split this season between Chicago and Rockford in the American Hockey League.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Darling went 9-4-0 during the season, and he posted a 1.95 goals against average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''You just kind of get thrown into it,'' Darling said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Keith ended the game with his one-timer from the blue line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jonathan Toews had a goal and an assist, and Niklas Hjalmarsson, Patrick Sharp and Jonathan Toews each scored for Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Patrick Kane also had two assists in his return after missing 21 games with a broken collarbone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Keith credited Marian Hossa with getting a bank pass back to him before trying to put the puck on net as quickly as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>His shot beat Pekka Rinne on the glove side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''I don't know if the goalie was able to see it very well,'' Keith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I think we had some guys going to the net and maybe helped out on the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>I just want to get it on net.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I was lucky that it went in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Colin Wilson scored twice and Viktor Stalberg had a goal, all in the first period for the Predators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Game 2 is Friday night in Nashville.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''Other than the second period, I thought we played a really good game,'' Nashville captain Shea Weber said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''Five-on-five, we had some really good chances to win it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Chicago came in leading the NHL with 57 postseason wins dating back to 2009 with two Stanley Cup titles - and just missed playing for another last year, losing the Western Conference finals in seven games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>So falling behind 0-3 after the first period was no big deal for the Blackhawks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Nashville was playing its first postseason game since 2012 and had a standing room only crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Predators missed their first division title with a late-season skid and came into the playoffs in an 0-4-2 slide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Chicago lost its last four regular-season games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Both teams looked ready for the postseason, though the Blackhawks didn't get going until the second period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Predators got a nice boost from a crowd filled with Nashville fans after the team limited early ticket sales to this game to local stores and the box office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That kept the inside of the arena painted gold, with very few of the Blackhawks faithful who usually take advantage of the short flight from Chicago on hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Nashville forced Crawford out with three goals on 12 shots in the first period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Wilson, who snapped a 15-game goal drought, scored first with a wrister and then tipping a shot by Seth Jones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Stalberg, waived twice by Nashville this season, spending much of the season in Milwaukee, scored on a wraparound late in the first period when Crawford got caught at the end boards playing the puck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Darling was helped by facing only four shots in the second period as Chicago answered with three goals - two with a man advantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Hjalmarsson scored on a snap shot on 4-on-4, then Sharp scored on a slap shot just 11 seconds after getting a 5-on-3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Then 17 seconds after Mattias Ekholm went to the box for cross checking, Toews tied it from close range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Darling got Chicago to overtime with a handful of big saves in the third period, stopping Ryan Ellis and then Roman Josi by sticking his right leg out to the post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He had several more stops in the overtimes, and officials missed Keith pulling Taylor Beck down by grabbing the back of his pants in the first overtime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>''We had opportunities to score,'' Nashville coach Peter Laviolette said of Darling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Notes: Chicago and Quenneville are 10-7 in the first game of a playoff series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>... The Predators finished without center Mike Fisher, who left with a lower-body injury after playing 25 seconds of the second period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>... Both Chicago and Nashville managed three goals each on their last 25 power plays of the regular season; the Blackhawks had two with the Predators one in this game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>... Nashville is 2-6 all-time in overtime in the playoffs.</td></tr>
