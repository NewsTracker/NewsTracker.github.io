<tr><td>11</td><td>GARISSA, Kenya (AP) - Al-Shabab gunmen rampaged through a university in northeastern Kenya at dawn Thursday, killing 147 people in the group's deadliest attack in the East African country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Four militants were slain by security forces to end the siege just after dusk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The masked attackers - strapped with explosives and armed with AK-47s - singled out non-Muslim students at Garissa University College and then gunned them down without mercy, survivors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Others ran for their lives with bullets whistling through the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The men took dozens of hostages in a dormitory for several hours as they battled troops and police before the operation was ended after about 13 hours, witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When gunfire from the Kenyan security forces struck the attackers, the militants exploded "like bombs," Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said, adding that the shrapnel wounded some of the officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Al-Shabab spokesman Ali Mohamud Rage said fighters from the Somalia-based extremist group were responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The al-Qaida-linked group has been blamed for a series of attacks in Kenya, including the siege at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in 2013 that killed 67 people, as well as other violence in the north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Most of the 147 dead were students, but the two security guards, one policeman and one soldier also were killed in the attack, Nkaissery said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>At least 79 people were wounded at the campus 145 kilometers (90 miles) from the Somali border, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A dusk-to-dawn curfew was ordered in Garissa and three nearby counties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>One suspected extremist was arrested as he tried to flee, Nkaissery told a news conference in Nairobi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Police identified a possible mastermind of the attack as Mohammed Mohamud, who is alleged to lead al-Shabab's cross-border raids into Kenya, and they posted a $220,000 bounty for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Also known by the names Dulyadin and Gamadhere, he was a teacher at an Islamic religious school, or madrassa, and claimed responsibility for a bus attack in Makka, Kenya, in November that killed 28 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>One of the survivors of Thursday's attack, Collins Wetangula, told The Associated Press he was preparing to take a shower when he heard gunshots coming from Tana dorm, which hosts both men and women, 150 meters (yards) away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The campus has six dorms and at least 887 students, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>When he heard the gunshots, he locked himself and three roommates in their room, said Wetangula, who is vice chairman of the university's student union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"All I could hear were footsteps and gunshots. Nobody was screaming because they thought this would lead the gunmen to know where they are," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He added: "The gunmen were saying, 'Sisi ni al-Shabab,'" - Swahili for "We are al-Shabab."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He heard the attackers arrive at his dormitory, open the doors and ask if the people who had hidden inside were Muslims or Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The gunmen then started shooting rapidly, as if exchanging fire, Wetangula said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The next thing, we saw people in military uniform through the window of the back of our rooms who identified themselves as the Kenyan military," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The soldiers took him and around 20 others to safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The attack began about 5:30 a.m., as morning prayers were underway at the university mosque, where worshippers were not attacked, said Augustine Alanga, a 21-year-old student.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>At least five heavily armed, masked gunmen opened fire outside his dormitory, turning intense almost immediately and setting off panic, he told the AP by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The shooting kept some students indoors but scores of others fled through barbed-wire fencing around the campus, with the gunmen firing at them, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"I am just now recovering from the pain as I injured myself while trying to escape, Alanga said. I was running barefoot," Alanga said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>As terrified students streamed out of buildings, arriving police officers took cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Kenya's National Police Service said a "fierce shootout" ensued as police guarded the dorms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Three of the dorms were evacuated, with the gunmen holed up in a fourth, the National Disaster Operations Center said, and Kenya Defense Forces surrounded the campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"I am saddened to inform the nation that early today, terrorists attacked Garissa University College, killed and wounded several people, and have taken others hostage," President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a speech to the nation while the siege was underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The U.S. condemned the attack, with White House spokesman Josh Earnest saying Washington was standing with the people of Kenya, "who will not be intimidated by such cowardly attacks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also condemned it, reiterating his solidarity with the Kenyans "to prevent and counter terrorism and violent extremism," his office said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Michael Bwana, a 20-year-old student, said he and other survivors tried to call their friends trapped in a dormitory, but their phones were switched off - either by their owners to keep them from ringing or by the gunmen who seized them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"Most of the people still inside there are girls," Bwana said, referring to the dorm where gunmen are believed to be holding an unknown number of captives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Wetangula, who was rescued by troops, said one soldier instructed a group of students to run and to dive for cover at their command as they ran to safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"We started running and bullets were whizzing past our heads, and the soldiers told us to dive," Wetangula said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The soldier told students later that al-Shabab snipers were perched on a three-story dormitory called the Elgon, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Some of the more seriously wounded were flown to Nairobi for treatment, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Kenyatta has been under pressure to deal with insecurity caused by a string of attacks by al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>In his speech to the country, he said he had directed the police chief to fast-track the training of 10,000 police recruits because Kenya has "suffered unnecessarily due to shortage of security personnel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Kenya's northern and eastern regions near the Somali border have seen many attacks blamed on al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The group has vowed to retaliate against Kenya for dispatching troops to Somalia in 2011 to fight the militants following cross-border attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Last month, al-Shabab claimed responsibility for attacks in Mandera county on the Somali border in which 12 people died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Four of them died in an attack on the convoy of the county's governor.</td></tr>

<tr><td>57</td><td>Last week, al-Shabab claimed responsibility for a siege at a Mogadishu hotel that left 24 people dead, including six attackers.</td></tr>
