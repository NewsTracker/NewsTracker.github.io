<h3>Cyclone Pam leaves trail of destruction in Pacific's Vanuatu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Communication systems in many of the hard-hit outer islands remained down, meaning it could take some time before the full extent of the damage caused by Cyclone Pam is known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer who is in Port Vila, said the capital's streets were littered with roofs blown from homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She said she's hearing reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She said there is no power or running water in the capital and that communication remains unreliable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's still really quite dangerous outside. Most people are still hunkering down," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The damage is quite extensive in Port Vila but there are so many more vulnerable islands. I can't even imagine what it's like in those vulnerable communities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Morrison said the winds seemed to peak between midnight and 1 a.m. Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She said she was in a fully boarded-up cyclone-proof house but still spent a frightening night as a tree and a tin roof from a nearby home hit her house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A westward change of course put populated areas directly in the path of Cyclone Pam's 270 kilometer (168 mile) -per-hour winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were unconfirmed reports of deaths in Vanuatu's northeastern islands after Cyclone Pam moved off its expected track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Australia was preparing to send a crisis response team to Vanuatu if needed, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There are destructive winds, rain, flooding, landslides, sea surges and very rough seas and the storm is exceedingly destructive there," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We are still assessing the situation, but we stand ready to assist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 spread over 65 islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>About 47,000 people live in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The tiny Pacific island nation has repeatedly warned it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing resettlement to higher ground and smaller yields on traditional crops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The cyclone has already destroyed some homes and caused damage to other Pacific islands including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>David Gibson, acting director of the Vanuatu meteorology and geo-hazards department, said the winds could cause severe damage to the nation's buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Alice Clements, a spokeswoman for relief agency UNICEF who is in Port Vila, said Friday the capital was like a ghost town as people took shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She said the pelting rain was blown horizontally by the wind.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>It's understood huge quantities of emergency food and other aid are sitting idle in the Vanuatu Mobile Force barracks in the capital Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Local newspaper the Vanuatu Daily Post reports that National Disaster Management Office officials are arguing over the distribution of aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Government spokesman Kiery Manassah says the aid is being stalled because islanders are likely to have enough to eat this week, while the food will be needed next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He also says the government wants to make sure the needs of all the estimated 67,000 households affected by the savage storm are met equally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The government wants transparency, accountability and a fair distribution of relief supplies," Mr Manassah told the Vanuatu Daily Post.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>She said people desperately needed food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"In Vanuatu we get earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, cyclones. We're used to disasters. We know how to get things going again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"This time we have all this help, but seven days later we still don't have the one thing we need - food."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Vanuatu has hit out at the lack of coordination among aid groups swarming the cyclone-ravaged Pacific nation, which it says is costing precious time getting help to those in need, while warning food will run out in a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Relief agencies have been battling logistical challenges in the sprawling archipelago with a lack of landing strips and deep water ports hampering their efforts to reach distant islands and get a better grip on the full scale of the disaster.</td></tr>

<tr><td>34</td><td>National disaster committee deputy chair Benjamin Shing said while the country appreciates the aid, the initial response could have been handled better with many groups and NGOs working on their own rather than in cooperation with the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I do apologise but I have to state the facts. We have seen this time and time again," he said at a briefing in the capital Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"In nearly every country in the world where they go in they have their own operational systems, they have their own networks and they refuse to conform to government directives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"We had to spend the first three days trying to get some form of coordination in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>That was much precious time that could have been spent doing the assessments instead." Oxfam country director in Port Vila Colin Collett van Rooyen denied any disorganisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"Our position is that we will continue to work with the government, as we have been, and as we always do, to address the best interests of those in need," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In a situation update, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) noted: "Coordination with the ministry of health regarding flights to provinces is critical".</td></tr>

<tr><td>47</td><td>Staff at the capital's main school are desperately trying to salvage resources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"There are lots of book warehouses out there, you know in the western world books are going out of fashion, you can't sell your second-hand books, you can't get rid of them. Well, we need good books, good encyclopedias, reference books, all subjects, reading books." said Port Vila Central School headmaster Paul Alexander Hetyey.</td></tr>

<tr><td>52</td><td>Almost a week after the cyclone, relief missions are just now beginning to reach Vanuatu's devastated outer Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Relief agencies are battling logistical challenges in the sprawling archipelago with a lack of landing strips and deep water ports hampering their efforts to reach distant islands and get a better grip on the full scale of the disaster.</td></tr>
