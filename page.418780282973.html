<h3>Broncos DE Derek Wolfe suspended 4 games (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - This is a July 25, 2014, file photo, showing Denver Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe during a morning training session at the team's NFL football training camp in Englewood, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Derek Wolfe will miss the first month of the season after being suspended by the NFL for violating the league's policy on performance enhancing substances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wolfe said in a statement he took medicine this offseason that he didn't realize was prohibited by the NFL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>ENGLEWOOD, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>(AP) -- His scary spinal injury behind him along with the ill-fitting 4-3 defense, Derek Wolfe couldn't wait for the 2015 season to get here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He won't be on the field now when it does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The NFL informed the Denver Broncos on Friday that Wolfe would be suspended for the first month of the season for violating the league's policy on performance enhancing substances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a statement, the fourth-year pro offered his ''most sincere apology'' to the organization, his teammates and fans and insisted he took medicine this offseason that he didn't realize was banned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''The medication is not a substance which would enhance my on field performance in any way and I genuinely was unaware that it was prohibited, but players are responsible for what is in their bodies,'' Wolfe said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Losing one of their starting defensive ends is a big blow to a defense that's already dealing with big question marks at middle linebacker - the fulcrum of Wade Phillips' 3-4 scheme - as Danny Trevathan (knee) and Brandon Marshall (foot) are returning from surgeries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>During Wolfe's absence, the Broncos will rely more heavily upon veterans Malik Jackson and newcomer Vance Walker, who played for the Chiefs last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Wolfe's suspension also could benefit second-year pro Kenny Anunike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Wolfe can practice during training camp and play in the preseason before his Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>5-Oct. 5 banishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He'll miss games against some elite running backs, including Baltimore's Justin Forsett, Kansas City's Jamaal Charles and Minnesota's Adrian Peterson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That puts added pressure on safety T.J. Ward and outside linebackers Von Miller, DeMarcus Ware and first-round pick Shane Ray to stop the run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Wolfe played in every game last year, contributing to a Denver defensive line that allowed 79.8 rushing yards per game, the lowest single-season figure in team history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said this spring, however, that he was just a shell of himself in 2014 after missing a good chunk of the previous season, which was marked by a seizure on the team bus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Doctors believe that was related to a bruised spinal cord he suffered that preseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Wolfe hasn't played a true 3-4 - with three down linemen and four linebackers - since his days at the University of Cincinnati.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said this offseason he was actually surprised the Broncos drafted him in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After all, the old coaching staff preferred playing four down linemen and three linebackers most of the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Wolfe said the 3-4 suits him because ''I'm not really a speed rusher, I'm not really a big 330-pound defensive tackle, either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Wolfe is back up to 285 pounds after regaining all of the 30 pounds he lost in 2013.</td></tr>
