<h3>Microsoft takes a stand against revenge porn, announces it will remove links, access</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Microsoft wants to help victims of revenge porn regain control of their images and privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Revenge porn -- when someone, usually a spurned ex, shares private and sexual images of another person online without that person's consent -- is on the rise, and Internet companies including Google and Reddit have tried to combat it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Now Microsoft is stepping up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The company said that, when it is notified by a victim, it will remove links to photos and videos from search results in Bing and remove access to the content itself when shared on OneDrive or Xbox Live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While people have been able to report to Microsoft in the past, it has set up a new reporting Web page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is available in English and will be expanded to other languages in the coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Microsoft said that when it removes links or content, it will do so globally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jacqueline Beauchere, Microsoft's chief online safety officer, called revenge porn a "despicable practice" with effects that "can be truly devastating."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It can damage nearly every aspect of a victim's life: relationships, career, social activities. In the most severe and tragic cases, it has even led to suicide," she said in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's important to remember, for example, that removing links in search results to content hosted elsewhere online doesn't actually remove the content from the Internet; victims still need stronger protections across the Web and around the world," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last month, Google said it would create a process for victims of revenge porn to request the removal of private photographs from the search engine's results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Facebook, Twitter and Reddit banned revenge porn earlier this year.</td></tr>
