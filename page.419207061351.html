<tr><td>83</td><td>Michael Dannenberg, a director at Education Reform Now, heralded Clinton's plan for not being a "typical more money for college aid approach."</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>"This plan exemplifies the fact that both resources and reform are key to any pragmatic, progressive approach to higher education and K-12 challenges," Clinton said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>89</td><td>Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican candidate, said Clinton's proposal was "irresponsible."</td></tr>

<tr><td>96</td><td>College affordability is a hot topic on the Democratic side of the 2016 presidential race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley unveiled a debt-free college plan in July, promising to lower tuition at state college and universities and tying loan repayment to income.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>"Unless we act now, more and more students will not be able to afford higher education at all, putting the American Dream even further out of reach," the former governor said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>After Clinton rolled out her plan, the O'Malley campaign needled Clinton for releasing the plan after the former Maryland governor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>"Debt-free college is an issue where Governor O'Malley has led, not followed," said Lis Smith, O'Malley's top strategist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>"We need big, bold goals like Governor O'Malley's vision to make college debt-free for all students, and Governor O'Malley's plan to expand pell grants and freeze college tuition is the standard of how to get us there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders promised voters earlier this year that he would make all four-year public college and universities tuition free.</td></tr>

<tr><td>109</td><td>"Hillary Clinton's plan is very big and ambitious -- leading to debt-free college and increased economic opportunity for millions of Americans," PCCC co-founder Adam Green said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>"The center of gravity on higher education has shifted from tinkering with interest rates to making college debt free -- and Clinton's bold proposal is emblematic of the rising economic populist tide in American politics."</td></tr>
