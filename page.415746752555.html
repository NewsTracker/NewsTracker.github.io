<h3>Fin24.com | Facebook bets on Messenger app for e-commerce</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>San Francisco - Facebook is turning its Messenger application into a platform for e-commerce, video and more in a bid to shake up online communication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Messenger Platform, describing it as a way for software developers to boost appeal to the more than 600 million people using the application.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We think this service has the potential to allow people to express themselves in new ways... and to be an important communication tool for the world," Zuckerberg said at the California-based company's annual developers' conference that ends on Thursday in San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Facebook executives introduced more than 25 products and tools tailored to help developers "build, grow, and monetise" mobile applications aimed at the social network's audience of approximately 1.39 billion people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Messenger is being upgraded to allow users to share photos, audio clips, videos, animated snippets and other digital content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The changes underscore Facebook's vision for Messenger as a new communication tool that complements the social network and ramps up efforts to compete with rivals like Snapchat, which is adding media partners to its messaging app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They are trying to make Messenger a full-featured and rich media platform," said Gartner analyst Brian Blau at the conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think that they are interested in letting people know that Facebook is not a single app company, it is an app constellation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Along with Messenger and its eponymous social networking application, Facebook owns WhatsApp and Instagram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Blau likened the Messenger move to the rise of Facebook as a platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One of the Messenger upgrades was designed to build on Facebook's move into e-commerce by weaving chat threads into purchases at websites, essentially turning formerly impersonal internet shopping into ongoing text message conversations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We're making Messenger a place where you can easily communicate with the businesses you care about in addition to the people you care about," Zuckerberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The e-commerce move comes a week after Facebook unveiled a way to use Messenger for peer-to-peer payments, and with the social network testing a "buy" button to allow users to make purchases directly from their Facebook pages.</td></tr>
