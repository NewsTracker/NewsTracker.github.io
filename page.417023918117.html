<h3>Recap: Baltimore vs. LA Angels</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baltimore, MD (SportsNetwork.com) - Jered Weaver pitched into the eighth inning to help the LA Angels of Anaheim to a 3-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles in the opener of a three-game set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Weaver (2-4) won his second straight start as he allowed just a run on three hits with a walk and three strikeouts over 7 1/3 innings for the Angels, who have won four straight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Albert Pujols hit a solo home run while Johnny Giavotella and Carlos Perez each drove in a run.</td></tr>
