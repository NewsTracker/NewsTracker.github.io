<h3>Parents arrested for not vaccinating</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Police have arrested more than 500 parents in and around the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar for not allowing their children to get the polio vaccine, an official said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Peshawar Deputy Commissioner Riaz Khan Mehsud told CNN that the 513 arrests took place Monday and Tuesday as part of a government campaign to administer polio vaccines in parts of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Those arrested will be released on bail if they sign an affidavit stating that they will let their children get vaccinated, according to the deputy commissioner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pakistan's vaccination rate is inordinately low for a number of reasons, including attacks on medical workers, the displacement of people due to ongoing military operations and a lack of trust by some families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Whatever the reason, the fact that a large number of children are not immunized is having an impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Such vaccines are credited with wiping out polio in most parts of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Pakistan is an exception, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a public-private partnership that includes the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The South Asian nation leads all others in new polio cases in recent years, and has nine of this year's 10 reported cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In 2014, Pakistan had 327 cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The next closest country was Nigeria, with 36 cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province hope to ensure that 2.7 million children there get vaccine drops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They've learned about more than 13,000 cases in which parents have not done so since a provincial campaign began two weeks ago, Mehsud said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dr. Bilal Ahmad, a UNICEF team leader based in Pakistan, called authorities' unprecedented move a last-ditch effort to clear polio from "cluster" zones where large numbers of families have refused to get their children vaccinated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"First the workers (try to) convince them, then their supervisors, then senior members of the community," Ahmad said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"(This government action) is the final step in eradicating this issue."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children, sometimes leading to paralysis and death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The virus is easily preventable through immunization, but there's no cure once it is contracted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It went from being a health issue to a security issue after U.S. intelligence officials used a vaccination program to help in their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Those administering the vaccines have become targets, with the National Emergency Operations Center reporting that more than 70 medical workers have been killed in attacks since December 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And in June 2012, Pakistani Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadur announced that polio vaccines would be banned in another Pakistani province -- North Waziristan -- because of drone strikes there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Bahadur called the strikes "worse than polio."</td></tr>

<h3>Growing fear in Russia leaves opposition in despair after murder of Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Moscow: The murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was the last straw for Dmitry Ostashenko, who decided to give up his life as a logistics manager in Moscow and try to leave Russia with his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We can't live here any more," Mr Ostashenko, 31, an opposition activist like his wife, Inna Malashenko, said at the Sunday march to commemorate Mr Nemtsov, carrying a sign that said "I'm Not Afraid".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ms Malashenko, 24, said: "We've tried to influence things but we see that we can't."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Zhanna, a daughter of murdered Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, farewells her father in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russia's liberal opposition is in despair after the Friday night slaying of Mr Nemtsov in the Kremlin's shadow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While the murder elicited international condemnation and sparked the largest opposition gathering since the protests of 2011 and 2012 against President Vladimir Putin's rule, rank-and-file activists say the Russian leader looks stronger than ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Putin gained from a peace agreement that helped curb fighting in Ukraine, easing international pressure as well as the threat of new sanctions on the ailing Russian economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Candles glow as people gather for a memorial service before the funeral of slain opposition figure Boris Nemtsov in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At home, Mr Nemtsov's assassination sent a chill down the spines of critics both inside and outside the ruling elite, said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin political adviser who was sent to Ukraine by Mr Putin to help manage Viktor Yanukovych's presidential campaign in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There's a sense of fear across the board," said Mr Pavlovsky, who advised the Kremlin during Mr Putin's first two terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This will make people more loyal and obedient."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While Mr Putin vowed to find the culprits, the suspicion remains that the murderers were confident of implicit support from the authorities, Mr Pavlovsky said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Members of the Nemtsov family embrace as people bring flowers to the grave of the slain Russian opposition figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Nemtsov, 55, was preparing to to publish information about Russia's role in the Ukrainian crisis, allies said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The liberal opposition has been struggling to gain traction against the backdrop of the nationalistic fervour whipped up by the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, near-record approval for Mr Putin and government persecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Of the movement's leaders, Alexey Navalny is serving a 15-day jail sentence for handing out pamphlets and Mikhail Khodorkovsky is in self-exile after a decade in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Putin, 62, has cracked down on political foes since he was first elected in 2000, stamping out opposing voices in parliament and tightening the state's control over media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He stepped up regulations on the internet and non-government organisations after the protests three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The pressure increased as the Ukrainian crisis deepened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>State television and pro-Kremlin rallies branded anti-Putin activists agents of foreign interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Nemtsov's allies blamed the government for creating an climate that led to the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>For Mr Ostashenko and Ms Malashenko, who worked on Mr Navalny's failed campaign for Moscow mayor in 2013, that adds up to overwhelming odds for Mr Putin, considering that the opposition candidate got 27 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The fact that 70 per cent of people in Moscow support Putin devitalises and demoralises us," Ms Malashenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The drive is also gone for Alexandra Borisova, 24, a volunteer observer in the 2011 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>While as many as 50,000 people turned out for Sunday's march, they were just "a drop in the ocean" in a city of more than 11 million, Ms Borisova, a computer programmer, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Even without the state propaganda, the attitude to Mr Nemtsov was negative," she said, waiting with a bouquet of orange roses to file past Mr Nemtsov's casket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"In Russia, they don't love liberals."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mr Putin's popularity remains near record levels at 86 per cent, the Levada polling company figures show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In another survey, it shows the number of people who say they have no sympathy for the opposition rising to 68 per cent from 59 per cent three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The opposition was counting on the economic crisis to spark a revolt on the scale of the 2011-2012 protests, the largest since the end of communism 20 years earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister who led the memorial march, vowed to pursue efforts to unseat Mr Putin and focused on democratic values, rather than the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We'll continue the fight for Russia to become a normal democratic country, where human rights and political freedoms are our highest values," he said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Russia's stabilising economy helps solidify Mr Putin's position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The notion of a palace coup by disgruntled allies, floated by some in the opposition including Mr Navalny, was less likely than ever, said Mr Pavlovsky, the former Kremlin adviser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>That leaves even those who feel too old to emigrate with tough choices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Igor Petrenko, 49, said he had encouraged his three adult children to get jobs abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>While he considered opposition rallies a waste of time, Mr Petrenko said he came along to protest Mr Nemtsov's death out of a sense of duty.</td></tr>
