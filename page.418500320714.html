<h3>Greece debt crisis: Eurozone clinches deal with Greece after all-night haggle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An agreement is reached with Greece after 17 hours of negotiations, allowing the near-bankrupt country to stay in the Eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>London: Europe has tiptoed back from the 'Grexit' precipice, with an in-principle bailout deal that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a "typical European compromise".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, angry Greeks called it a Berlin-led, anti-democratic "coup", disappointed that it appeared even harsher than the deal they rejected in a referendum a week ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new deal came with a laundry list of major and minor economic reforms and austerity measures that the country must put into law immediately before receiving the billions it needs to stave off its creditors and resuscitate its banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'We fought hard abroad, we must now fight at home against vested interests' ... Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras speaks to journalists following all-night bailout talks in Brussels, Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"One can say that we have a-Greek-ment," joked a tired European Council President Donald Tusk, after marathon talks that went through Sunday, into Sunday night and concluded over breakfast on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At stake was the financial future of an entire country: Greece, near-bankrupt, was days or perhaps hours from leaving Europe's common currency, which could have triggered financial 'contagion' in weak southern European economies and shaken faith in the European project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"There will not be a Grexit," Mr Juncker said after the deal was done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Euro summit has unanimously reached agreement": European Council President Donald Tusk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said they had "sent a message of dignity to all of Europe | Grexit is a thing of the past".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Eurogroup leaders frankly admitted that trust was an issue during the talks, insisting the Greek parliament must pass legislation in the next few days implementing reforms, before bailout money is released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Fiscal hawks in Germany, Austria and other northern European countries insisted that the 86-billion euro ($127.92 billion) bailout for Greece's debts to the IMF and European Central Bank was contingent on strict new austerity measures for the already punch-drunk Greek economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, far left, speaks with (from left) European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, French President Francois Hollande and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Getting the deal through parliament this week will be a challenge for Mr Tsipras, who may face a rebellion from his leftist alliance and have to rely on the votes of conservative opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The union covering Greece's public servants called for 24-hour strike for Wednesday, the day the parliament is to vote on reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel almost walked out of the bailout talks in Brussels, according to reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>- By Wednesday, Greece must legislate to increase VAT and remove exemptions such as the one for remote islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>- Also in the next two days, it must comprehensively reform the pension system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>- By the following Wednesday, Greece must adopt major reforms for its civil justice system, to accelerate legal cases and cut costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, speaks with journalists following all-night Greece bailout talks in Brussels, Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>- Greece must also open up professions such as pharmacy, manufacturing and transportation, and implement a 'toolkit' of market changes such as Sunday trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>- There will have to be a 'modernisation' of collective bargaining, industrial action and redundancy laws, to align with European norms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>- Greece is required to 'de-politicise' its public service, and further cut costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arrives in his car at the eurozone leaders' summit in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Part of the deal is a new 50-billion euro ($74.37 billion) asset fund, from the sale of assets such as the country's major ports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Half will be used to recapitalise the country's (currently closed and illiquid) banks, a quarter will pay off debt, and another quarter will be available to the Greek government to re-invest into the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Six other European parliaments will also need to approve the deal, after the votes in Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Europe's finance ministers will discuss bridge financing for Greece to address Greece's next loan repayment of 7 billion euros ($10.41 billion), due this month to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>One official told a reporter from The Guardian that the sessions between Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and Alexis Tsipras had resembled "extensive mental waterboarding".</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Two officials at the talks told Bloomberg that Tsipras looked like a "beaten dog", fretting about the reception awaiting him at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>According to one report, summit leader Donald Tusk at one point physically stopped Mr Tsipras and Dr Merkel from walking out of the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But after the deal was announced Mr Tsipras said he "fought a tough battle" in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"We fought hard abroad, we must now fight at home against vested interests," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"We took the responsibility for the decision to avert the most extreme plans by conservative circles in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"We managed to restructure debt and secure medium term financing. Greece will continue the fight to be able to return to growth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Greece appears to have won some concessions on restructuring its huge debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In a joint statement the Euro Summit said there were "serious concerns regarding the sustainability of Greek debt", and it was "ready to consider, if necessary, possibly additional measures (such as) possible longer grace and payment periods".</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said a debt haircut was out of the question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Mr Tsipras also took credit for keeping the asset fund within Greece, rather than having it based in Luxembourg which was the original proposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Domestic opponents to the deal may include former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who wrote on the weekend that the creditors' proposals were "absolutely impossible, totally non-viable and toxic".</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Greek Labour Minister Panos Skourletis said he could not blame MPs who would find it hard to say 'Yes' to the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"It's clear this deal does not represent us," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>But the Greek minister in charge of reforms, George Katrougalos, grudgingly accepted the terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"Everybody in Greece understands that the prime minister has given a fight at impossible odds and he has taken what was possible under the circumstances," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"The first obligation of a soldier is not to surrender and then to stay alive for the next battle. And I think the prime minister has succeeded in doing that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Dr Merkel said she believed trust could be regained between Berlin and Athens, based on this deal, but it would be a long and difficult road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Greeks reacted with fury online, to a deal which at first glance looked less favourable than the one they rejected in a referendum only a week ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The hashtag '#ThisIsACoup' continued to trend globally on Twitter, fuelled not only by Greece but also in the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland - reflecting continent-wide discomfort with the tone of the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Another popular hashtag was '#TsiprasLeaveEUSummit'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Greeks have objected to what they see as anti-democratic micromanagement of their economy from Berlin, via Brussels: the insistence on minor reforms such as Sunday retail opening hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>But Mr Juncker said the deal was a compromise with no winners or losers - a "typical European arrangement".</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"I don't think the Greek people have been humiliated and I don't think other European countries have lost face," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Financial markets greeted the news in Brussels positively, but there were no signs of exuberance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>But the euro weakened against both the US dollar and the pound, on expectations that US rates could rise sooner, and fears of long-term weakness in the European currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>ANZ Chief Economist Warren Hogan said: "The thing that was worrying markets had nothing to do with economics and was all about politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"You can't completely rule out a Grexit because of this announcement, although the chances of it have declined quite significantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>"From an economist's point of view, nothing's changed. All of the tough austerity and restructuring of the Greek economy lies ahead.</td></tr>
