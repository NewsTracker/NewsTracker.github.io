<h3>EU leaders pledge security cooperation, aid for Tunisia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EU governments are already deeply worried about chaos in Libya which has fueled an exodus of migrants that are putting a heavy strain on southern EU countries such as Italy.</td></tr>

<h3>Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino looking to bounce back from poor display against Manchester UnitedÂ </h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A 3-0 loss at Old Trafford has dented Tottenham's Champions League qualification chances but they welcome Premier League bottom-club Leicester to White Hart Lane on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And rather than having a week of reflection on last Sunday's result, Pochettino believes everyone knows what went wrong and how it can be addressed heading into the final stages of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'I didn't need to speak too much,' he replied when asked about the fall-out from the Old Trafford loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'It has been an easy week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>We all agree about what happened at Old Trafford and so it's easy to fix that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>We were all disappointed after the game, we know how we need to change, to fix that and for me after nine months here it was one of the easiest weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'We speak a lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The way we played we are all agreed we were poor, it was not a good performance, and on that we all agree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Leicester may be struggling at the foot on the table but they were successful at White Hart Lane in the FA Cup fourth round back in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'Leicester in the last few games have played differently from the FA Cup, they have changed the system,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'It's important to show that we are not affected by the last result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>We expect a very tough, important game because we have nine games left and it's important to start to win points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'It is an important game because we come from a big hit for us at Old Trafford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Defender Ben Davies agrees with his boss and insists the players will not be taking Leicester lightly after seeing first-hand just how good Nigel Pearson's side can be on the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'This is a big game for us and we know we need to try to bounce back after the result last weekend,' he told Tottenham's official website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'Leicester are fighting for their lives and they will be determined to try and get something out of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That result in the FA Cup keeps us on our toes, it's a warning there for us that they have showed us what they can do if we give them the opportunity.</td></tr>
