<h3>Apple bans Civil War games featuring Confederate flag from App store</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The political and corporate backlash against the Confederate flag is now extending to Civil War-themed games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple has removed a range of Civil War-themed games for sale from the App store, due to their depiction of the Confederate flag, amid a growing political and corporate backlash against the banner in the wake of the racially-motivated Charleston massacre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>We are not going to amend the game's content and Ultimate General: Gettysburg will no longer be available on App store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The move has prompted debate about how far moves to eradicate the emblem from American public life should go, as well as a mixed response from games developers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While some are now working to remove the Confederate flag from their products, others have defended it as appropriate and accurate in the context of historically-themed games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An image from the Civil War-themed game Ultimate General: Gettysburg, featuring the Confederate flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Confederate flag, formerly the battle flag of the General Robert E Lee's Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War, is a divisive symbol in the United States due to its associations with segregation, slavery and white supremacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Anger at its continued presence on public buildings reached fever pitch in the United States this week following the slaughter of nine African-American men and women in a Charleston, South Carolina church on June 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dylann Roof, who posed with the flag and professed white supremacist views, has been charged over the shooting deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>South Carolina subsequently decided to remove the flag from its state house, and retailers such as Walmart, Amazon and Etsy to removed Confederate flag paraphernalia from sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Screenshot from the game Ultimate General: Gettysburg showing the Confederate flag on the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Thursday, it appeared Apple had followed suit, removing Confederate flag wallpaper apps as well as some Civil War-themed games from sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple did not respond to requests for comment from Fairfax Media but said in a statement to TechCrunch that they were only targeting material that used the flag in offensive ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We have removed apps from the App Store that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean-spirited ways, which is in violation of our guidelines. We are not removing apps that display the Confederate flag for educational or historical uses."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But games developer HexWar confirmed their games Civil War: 1862, Civil War: 1863, Civil War: 1864 and Civil War: Gettysburg had been removed from the App store after receiving a notification from Apple that "your app has been removed from the App Store because it includes images of the Confederate flag used in offensive and mean-spirited ways."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Andrew Mulholland from HexWar said the move was disappointing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We're in no way sympathetic to the use of the flag in an offensive way, we used it purely because historically that was the flag that was used at the time," he said in an email to Fairfax Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mulholland said they were now looking at replacing the flag with other flags used by the Confederacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We're going to use the Confederate flag from 1861 and 1862 as the one that's considered offensive wasn't introduced until late 1862," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Hopefully they'll accept the changes, but it will have to go back through the review process again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Another developer, Games Labs, said while they accepted Apple's decision, they would not be reworking their game Ultimate General: Gettysburg to try to get it reinstated to the store, and defended the historical accuracy of their game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We accept Apple's decision and understand that this is a sensitive issue for the American Nation," Games Lab said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We wanted our game to be the most accurate, historical, playable reference of the Battle of Gettysburg. All historical commanders, unit composition and weaponry, key geographical locations to the smallest streams or farms are recreated in our game's battlefield."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"[Steven] Spielberg's Schindler's List did not try to amend his movie to look more comfortable. The historical Gettysburg movie (1993) is still on iTunes. We believe that all historical art forms: books, movies, or games such as ours, help to learn and understand history, depicting events as they were."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Therefore we are not going to amend the game's content and Ultimate General: Gettysburg will no longer be available on App store."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive officer, had Tweeted his support for removing "symbols & words" that feed racism last Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>My thoughts are with the victim's families in SC.Let us honor their lives by eradicating racism & removing the symbols & words that feed it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The move by Apple prompted some criticism from users online, concerned the ban was ignoring the context in which the symbol was used in some cases and pointing out that World War II games featuring Nazi insignia were still being sold from the store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Apple is removing games that contain the Confederate Flag?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But even WW2 games have people with Nazi insignia all over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Apple bans Civil War games featuring Confederate...</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Full Microsoft Office apps finally available on...</td></tr>
