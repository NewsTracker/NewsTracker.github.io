<h3>China Ups Solar Target By 20%: Is It Achievable? Who Will Benefit?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Who Will Benefit?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>China's National Energy Administration has increased its solar installation target target to 17.8 GW for 2015, marking a 20% increase from the provisional installation target of 15 GW outlined in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The new target is likely to be met with some skepticism given that the country failed to meet its 14 GW target in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, despite the previous missteps, we believe that the ambitious new target signals that the government is determined to drive solar installation growth and is also more confident about some of the regulatory and structural changes that have taken effect in the country's solar market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In this note, we take a look at some of the issues that prevented China from achieving its 2014 installation targets, the recent changes to the solar landscape in China and also some of the potential beneficiaries of the higher installation target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Why China Failed To Meet Its Target in 2014: China failed to meet its solar target for 2014, installing only about 10.5 GW, against an initial plan of 14 GW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The shortfall was due to multiple reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Firstly, last year's target was heavily skewed towards distributed generation, which is a nascent market where project sponsors encountered property and regulatory issues in both rooftop and ground mounted installations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The country is estimated to have installed only 3 GW of DG DG - less than half the planned amount.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Secondly, there was a transfer in the solar project approval process from state level to the provincial level last year and many provinces weren't well prepared to deal with applications, slowing down the pace of installations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Additionally, capital remained relatively scarce last year, with Chinese banks supplying only about $3.2 billion to the sector, well below the $12.8 billion that the market required.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Changes That Could Help In 2015 : The regulatory and financial landscape in the Chinese Photo Voltaic market has been undergoing a steady shift and we believe that it may be possible for the country to meet the 2015 target or at least come much closer to meeting it this time around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Provincial governments are becoming more familiar with the approval process for solar projects and the country is also moving to streamline approvals and incentives for distributed generation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There is some progress on the financing front as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>China's state run banks such as the China Development Bank are becoming more open to financing solar projects while private investors have also been warming up to solar as an asset class, as the technology becomes increasingly economically viable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This should improve capital flow into the solar industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Additionally, the landmark climate deal that China inked with the United States last November could also increase the urgency for renewables and push the government to meet its targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Under the deal, China has agreed to reduce its carbon emissions beginning from 2030 or earlier, while increasing energy use from zero-emission sources to 20% by 2030.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>How Solar Companies Can Benefit: We believe that the increased target could prove positive for solar companies such as Trina Solar and Yingli Green Energy, considering their sizable manufacturing capacity and their large exposure and understanding of the domestic market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>China accounted for 35% of Trina Solar's module shipments for 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Yingli estimates that about 30% of its revenues for FY 2014 will come from the Chinese market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Both companies also have significant manufacturing capacity that could cater to increased domestic demand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Trina Solar intends to increase module capacity from 4 GW per annum as of Q4 2014 to 4.8 GW by the end of 2015, while Yingli has a nameplate module manufacturing capacity of over 2.4 GW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Both companies are also likely to have flexibility in expanding their capacity further by forming joint ventures or taking over operations of weaker solar players in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>However, we believe that Trina Solar will have an edge when it comes to potential project developments over the long term, considering its strong financials and its greater credibility with lenders.</td></tr>

<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu walks back his opposition to a Palestinian state</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jerusalem: Days after winning Israel's election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be backtracking from hard-line statements that ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hours before the election, with polls showing he could lose, Mr Netanyahu declared that the Palestinians would never have a state on his watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict prior to his re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was a sweeping statement that flew in the face of his own past commitments and 25 years of international efforts to arrive at a two-state solution to the conflict: Israel and an independent Palestine living side-by-side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The US suggested the newly declared opposition to a Palestinian state could jeopardise America's unwavering support for Israel at the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The US would "re-evaluate our approach" based on Mr Netanyahu's "change in his position", White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Now Mr Netanyahu has said in a TV interview that he remains committed to Palestinian statehood - if conditions in the region improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I don't want a one-state solution. I want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution. But for that circumstances have to change," he told MSNBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The question is whether Netanyahu - who shifted sharply to the right in the last days of his campaign, using messages such as his "no-state" pledge to successfully draw right-wing votes away from ultranationalist parties - really meant what he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And if so, what it means for the Palestinians, relations with Israel and the future of the peace process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One of Netanyahu's closest confidants, Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon, said on BBC radio the very idea of two states was unworkable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Can you imagine a viable Palestinian entity, economic-wise? What about infrastructure, electricity, water?" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"They are connected to us like a Siamese twin, so the whole idea of full separation is not viable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Around Netanyahu and on the right-wing of Israeli politics - including party leaders likely to be in his next government - it is common to hear that the two-state solution is dead, with no way of reconciling Israel's security demands with Palestinian independence and no willingness on Israel's part to share Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek as a capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Instead, right-wing leaders like Naftali Bennett, the head of the pro-settler Jewish Home party and a candidate for a top post in the next government, advocate Israel's annexation of most of the West Bank, while granting the Palestinians "enhanced autonomy" within the remaining 40 per cent of the territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even under a two-state scenario, Israel talks about retaining major settlement blocs and control of the Jordan Valley, where the West Bank borders Jordan, leaving a patchwork behind, although land swaps with Israel would provide some compensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The idea of dividing Jerusalem is dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The impression that emerges is that Israeli leaders on the right would ultimately prefer a model in which the Palestinians have a high degree of self-rule but Israel's military retains control in a form of "benign occupation" of the West Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There is no active discussion along those lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Instead, Netanyahu's dismissal of two states will encourage the Palestinians to again seek recognition via the United Nations as well as bilaterally - 135 of 193 UN members already recognise the State of Palestine, including several EU member states, even if the EU itself does not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We will not backtrack from our position in demanding that international legitimacy be achieved," Abbas said on Thursday, adding that Netanyahu's words were worrying but not new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The shift may come from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In the past, including last December, Washington has stood in the way of Palestinian efforts to get a UN resolution recognising its statehood, including threatening to use its veto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But a US official said it was possible the Obama administration would now allow a Security Council resolution on a two-state solution to proceed by withholding its veto, a move that would alarm Netanyahu's government.</td></tr>
