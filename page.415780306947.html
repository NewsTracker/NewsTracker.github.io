<h3>Nigerian troops recapture Boko Haram 'headquarters'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Abuja, Nigeria: Nigerian troops have retaken the town of Gwoza from Boko Haram, from which the group declared its caliphate last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Troops this morning captured Gwoza destroying the Headquarters of the Terrorists self-styled Caliphate," Defence Headquarters in Abuja said on Twitter on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Several terrorists died while many are captured. Mopping up of entire Gwoza and her suburbs is ongoing," it added in a separate message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nigerian special forces prepare to fight Boko Haram in Diffa on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nigerian forces have retaken the Boko Haram stronghold of Gwoza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Earlier this month, residents who fled the town in Borno state said militants had been massing in Gwoza and killing local people who were unable to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That led to speculation the group, which has been pushed out of a number of towns in three northeast states in recent weeks, was preparing for a final assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared on August 24 last year Gwoza was "part of the Islamic caliphate", adding to speculation the militants were imitating the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An image still from a video released by Boko Haram in July, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Shekau had the previous month praised IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi but stopped short of pledging allegiance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He has since formally allied himself to the group in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nigeria's national security spokesman Mike Omeri said last week troops had begun the "final onslaught" against Boko Haram, saying Gwoza was one of three areas yet to be retaken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A four-nation coalition of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon has claimed a number of successes since the turn of the year to end the insurgency which has claimed more than 13,000 lives since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The ongoing operation was cited as a reason to delay Nigeria's general election on February 14 to this Saturday, as soldiers would not be able to provide security nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In a televised address broadcast on Friday, President Goodluck Jonathan hailed troops for having "successfully stemmed the seizure of Nigerian territories".</td></tr>
