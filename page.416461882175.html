<h3>NATO: Big military buildup on Russia-Ukraine border</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) " NATO's chief says there is a sizeable Russian military buildup on the border with Ukraine which he said would enable pro-Moscow separatists to launch a new offensive with little warning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that Russia has substantially stepped up supplies to the rebels, as well as providing them with advanced training and equipment like drones, despite a cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Stoltenberg says the reported Russian moves undermine the cease-fire and violate the Minsk agreements entered into by Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said more than 1,000 pieces of Russian military equipment have been moved over the past month, including tanks, artillery and air defense units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Stoltenberg said this "gives reason for great concern" and has given the separatists the capability to go on the offensive again with little warning.</td></tr>
