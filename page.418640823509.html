<tr><td>11</td><td>A pedestrian waits at a traffic light as the sign outside a funeral home reading "Funerals from 800 euros'' in Athens, Friday, July 17, 2015.

<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece's cash crisis has disrupted all aspects of daily life - death included.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Greek funeral homes are struggling to cope with banking restrictions that limit customers to taking out only 60 euros ($65) a day in cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Even a modest funeral service in Greece costs more than 15 times that, in a country that traditionally carries out funerals shortly after death and pays for them almost entirely in cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Especially this week, with the capital controls at the banks, no matter who we asked money from, we couldn't even recover our costs," said Eustratios Voulamandis, who runs a funeral home in a blue-collar neighborhood west of Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In a back room of the funeral home, work carries on, as employees remove shrink wrap from coffins and use a staple gun to fasten ornamental fabric around the caskets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But Voulamandis' business relies on lump sum payments made by survivors that start at 800 euros ($866) and are currently impossible to collect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"To get started on a funeral service, we need 800-1,000 euros but people are giving us 50, 70, even 20 euros and telling us it's all they have," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Funeral homes demand that much money upfront because of fears they won't get paid by cash-strapped Greeks after the ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And it's almost always cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Credit cards and especially checks are rarely used for such transactions in Greece, which remains a cash-based economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The difficulties in raising cash have produced some macabre consequences, Voulamandis and other funeral home operators said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some bodies have had to spend more time than usual at the morgue, and some people have had to declare legal insolvency to be eligible for state-funded funerals for their relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Greece's banks have been closed since June 29 after the country flirted with bankruptcy, defaulting on debts to the International Monetary Fund as its second bailout deal expired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The banks are scheduled to reopen Monday but still have a daily cash withdrawal limit of 60 euros and a weekly cash limit of 420 euros ($455).</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>No one knows when those restrictions on cash withdrawals will be lifted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Cash controls have choked the country's economy as Greece sinks back in recession, according to most major forecasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Private services considered essential are surviving on an informal credit system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Petros Kampitsis, a mason who makes marble headstones near an Athens cemetery, says Greeks are now opting for the most basic burial services - a move that is killing his business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We have a big problem, a very big problem. ... People don't have money and they're trying to organize funerals at the lowest possible cost," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Once a funeral has taken place, what remains is to decorate the tomb. But what happens if you have no money? That doesn't happen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The lack of cash means the industry is frozen," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>At the nearby Athens cemetery, an elderly widow was visiting her husband's grave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Embarrassed by her poverty, she asked to be identified only by her first name, Fani.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Fani said she didn't have the money to hold a memorial service and a dinner for the upcoming one-year anniversary of her husband's death, as is tradition.</td></tr>
