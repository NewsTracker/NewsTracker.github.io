<h3>Blatter's future as president at stake in FIFA election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA president Joseph S. Blatter, right, walks past Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, left, and UEFA President Michel Platini, center, during the 65th FIFA Congress held at the Hallenstadion in Zurich, Switzerland, Friday, May 29, 2015, where he will run for re-election as FIFA head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ZURICH (AP) - The future of soccer's embattled governing body was at stake Friday as Sepp Blatter sought a fifth term as FIFA president amid the biggest corruption crisis in the organization's 111-year history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Voting among the 209 member federations began Friday with the 79-year-old Blatter up for re-election against Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Both men gave final speeches just before the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Blatter said he would guide FIFA through the "storm" caused by the investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You know who you are dealing with. I also know that I can count on you," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I am with you. I would just like to stay with you. It is a matter of trust."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A two-thirds majority would be enough for Blatter or Prince Ali to win the secret presidential vote, or a simple majority in a second round of voting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Just forcing the ballot to a second round could represent a victory of sorts for Blatter's critics, denying the incumbent president an emphatic mandate in his next term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Leading up to the election, Blatter refused calls to resign after FIFA was targeted by U.S. and Swiss authorities in separate corruption investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier Friday, Blatter spoke at the FIFA congress and said the crisis stems from the decision to award Russia and Qatar the next two World Cup tournaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 2010, Russia was chosen to host the 2018 World Cup and Qatar was awarded the 2022 tournament amid widespread allegations of wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If two other countries had emerged from the envelope, I think we would not have these problems today," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But we can't go back in time. We are not prophets. We can't say what would have happened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The United States was one of the losing bidders for the 2022 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On Wednesday, U.S. authorities indicted 14 people on bribery, racketeering, fraud and money-laundering charges going back to the 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Seven of the officials - including two serving FIFA vice presidents - were arrested in Zurich on Wednesday ahead of the congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I am not going to use the word coincidence but I do have a small question mark," Blatter said about the timing of the raid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The two criminal investigations have cast a new shadow on Blatter's 17-year reign as president of FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Amid the dramatic build up to the election, UEFA president Michel Platini appealed to Blatter on Thursday to immediately step down - calls the president rejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I am willing to accept the president of FIFA is responsible for everything but I would at least like to share that responsibility with everyone," Blatter said in a presidential address on Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We cannot constantly supervise everyone in football ... you cannot ask everyone to behave ethically."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Blatter also cautioned that "it will take some time" to rebuild FIFA's reputation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The events of Wednesday have unleashed a storm and there was even questioned whether this congress would be organized or change the agenda," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Today I am appealing to unity and team spirit so we can move forward together. That may not always be easy but it is for this reason that we are here together today."</td></tr>
