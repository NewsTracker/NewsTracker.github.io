<h3>England eliminates host Canada in World Cup Q-final, 2-1 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Lucy Bronze had never played in front of anything she could compare to that flag-waving, drum-banging, deafening Canadian crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jodie Taylor had to laugh as she looked around BC Place to see a few overwhelmed English fans in that rambunctious sea of red.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It felt like England against the world in this World Cup quarterfinal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And that was nothing the Lionesses couldn't handle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Taylor and Bronze scored in the shocking first 14 minutes, and England eliminated Canada from its home World Cup with a 2-1 victory Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''To play against a crowd that was basically about 54,000 of them against us and only 10 for us, was an unbelievable experience,'' said Bronze, whose header turned out to be the winner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''It's something that we'll probably never experience again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Credit to the Canadian fans, because it was hard to play in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Lionesses dug to the depths of their training and spirit to survive, even navigating a second-half goalkeeper change to secure their nation's first trip to the semifinals in the women's tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With two early strikes and tenacious defensive play, England crushed the hopes of a host nation hoping to celebrate Canada's first World Cup title on this same field next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Instead, England will face defending champion Japan in the semifinals in Edmonton, Alberta, on Wednesday - which also happens to be Canada Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Game by game, this team has more belief,'' said Taylor, a surprise choice for the starting lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''To be playing the hosts in front of 54,000 Canadian fans is quite a brutal environment to be in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>England's surge to the quarterfinals raised attention to the perpetually overlooked Lionesses, and the strong backing of Prince William further increased the spotlight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>With this gritty victory, they're two wins away from their first World Cup title - something their male counterparts haven't won since 1966, as any English football fan knows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''We're ... now the third England team to get to a semifinal, joining the '66 and that '90 group,'' England coach Mark Sampson said, the meaning clear in his voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I've never been in a stadium as loud, as passionate for their team as that was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Christine Sinclair scored in the 42nd minute for Canada, which had given up just one goal in the entire World Cup before giving up two more just three minutes apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After Taylor scored the opener on a horrible turnover by Lauren Sesselmann, Bronze added an impressive long header to build a lead that England never relinquished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Although Sinclair got one back before halftime, Canada struggled to generate many good chances in the waning minutes of the scoreless second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The drought slowly crushed the crowd of 54,027 supporting a plucky, defense-minded team that never scored more than one goal in any World Cup match while reaching its first quarterfinal since 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''I'm proud of my girls,'' Canada coach John Herdman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''They give you everything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It just wasn't good enough tonight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The dream is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>England wasn't even bothered when Siobhan Chamberlain replaced goalie Karen Bardsley early in the second half after Bardsley complained about a problem with her right eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Chamberlain is on her third World Cup team, but got about 30 seconds to warm up for her first appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''Well, they can't start the game without me, so it was pointless to be rushing,'' laughed Chamberlain, who believes Bardsley has an infection that caused her eye to swell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>After Canada opened the quarterfinal with an impressive push, Taylor pounced in the 11th minute when the ball got away from a falling Sesselmann.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Taylor dodged another defender and tucked in the first goal for a 29-year-old forward and Oregon State product who only made her senior team debut last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>With the crowd still in disbelief, Bronze doubled the Lionesses' lead by heading Fara Williams' long pass off the crossbar and in for her second goal of the World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>England's bench players leaped onto the field in elation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The crowd was somnolent until a dropped ball by Bardsley led to the 155th international goal by Sinclair, the British Columbia product in her fourth World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>England controlled long stretches of play after Chamberlain came on, but Canada eventually pushed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Sophie Schmidt had perhaps Canada's best late chance in the 83rd minute, but put a low pass high over England's net.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Sinclair put a header well wide off a corner kick in the 90th minute, and England ran out the clock on a dramatic victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''You could just cry, right?'' Herdman asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>''We knew that if we take this game, we've got a real shot at going all the way through.</td></tr>
