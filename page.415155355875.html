<h3>Nelson Shanks claims he put reference to Monica Lewinsky's infamous blue dress in Bill Clinton painting that hangs in National Portrait Gallery?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Pennsylvania artist Nelson Shanks said that he slipped a Monica Lewinsky reference into the full-body portrait because the scandal was something he could never get 'completely out of his mind'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The painter said that the reference to former President Clinton's affair with the former White House intern was in the shadows of the painting, in the form of her infamous blue dress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Presidential: The full-body painting of Bill Clinton debuted in the National Portrait Gallery in 2006 (pictured above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Scandal: Circled on the left, there's a shadow under the mantle that's in the silhouette of a dress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'If you look at the left-hand side of it there's a mantle in the Oval Office and I put a shadow coming into the painting and it does two things,' Shanks told Philly.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He added: 'It actually literally represents a shadow from a blue dress that I had on a mannequin, that I had there while I was painting it, but not when he was there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shanks, who's painted portraits of Princess Diana and Pope John Paul II, also said that Clinton was the 'most famous liar of all time'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The portrait caused controversy when it first was revealed in 2006 because it looks like Clinton is not wearing a wedding band, according to the New York Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And according to Shanks, the Clintons 'hate the portrait' and are 'putting a lot of pressure' on the National Portrait Gallery to remove it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But a spokeswoman for the gallery has denied those accusations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>When the painting was first debuted in 2006, it seemed as though Bill Clinton was quite pleased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'I think the painting really feels like Bill Clinton,' he said then, according to the Washington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'It has - I would not call it swagger... What?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An informality?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Shanks's most famous works include Princess Diana, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Luciano Pavarotti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In 2009 the artist was awarded the Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement by the Portrait Society of America, while in 2011 he was voted an honorary member into the Russian Academy for his works of art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Shanks said because of the Lewinsky controversy, Clinton was the hardest person for him to paint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Lewinsky, who was 22 when she started interning at the White House claimed to have sexual relations with Clinton nine times between 1995 and 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Clinton initially swore under oath that he 'did not have sexual relations' with Lewinsky but later admitted that he had misled the American public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lewinsky revealed her relationship with the president involved oral sex but not sexual intercourse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She famously kept a blue dress which she claimed held DNA evidence of their affair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In late July, 1998, Monica had to turn a dress over to Kenneth Starr's investigators after signing an immunity agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Clinton, however, was found not guilty and though he was impeached, he remained in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>And with speculations that Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, might launch her 2016 presidential bid in April, Bill Clinton could be back in office within two years.</td></tr>

<h3>New Mexico students walk out over new tests contested in US</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Students frustrated over the new exam walked out of schools across the state Monday in protest as the new exam was being given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The backlash came as millions of U.S. students start taking more rigorous exams aligned with Common Core standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - New assessment tests that have angered parents and teachers across the nation prompted walkouts Monday by hundreds of high school students in New Mexico who had been set to take the exams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The backlash came as millions of U.S. students started taking the rigorous tests aligned with Common Core standards that outline math and language skills that should be mastered in each grade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>New Mexico is among a dozen states debuting the tests this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Opponents say the exams distract from real learning, put added stress on students and staff members, and waste resources, especially in poor districts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Parents and students in Colorado, Pennsylvania and New York have already opted out of the exams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Others are lobbying lawmakers and education officials for change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Florida last week, Gov. Rick Scott suspended spring testing for 11th graders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In New Mexico, a few hundred students at Albuquerque High School joined the walkout despite warnings from administrators that they could face discipline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>About 100 other students at nearby Highland High School also left class as testing began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Students at both schools took to the sidewalks with signs and chanted as supporters honked their horns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The test - called the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC - can also be used in teacher evaluations and school grades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Maya Quinones, 18, an Albuquerque High School senior, said administrators warned her that participating in the walkout might prevent her from taking part in graduation ceremonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If we make something happen, if next year comes around and the PARCC test is gone, then I feel like we're successful," said Quinones, an organizer of the protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"And you know what? As long as I get my diploma, I'm all right. I don't have to walk in line."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Julie Guevara, 16, said students believe the testing is taking away from their overall education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We hope the governor hears us and does something about this," Guevara said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We're not going away and plan to do this again until the testing is done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Gov. Susana Martinez's office said annual assessments are required by the federal government and this particular test was designed by teachers and educators to address concerns about previous "fill-in-the-bubble" tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Students from all over the country are transitioning to a different exam this year," Martinez spokesman Enrique Knell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We aren't alone, and this transition has been occurring for many years."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Things went fairly smoothly for the thousands of New Mexico students who did take the test, although some computer glitches were reported, state officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The walkouts and demonstrations in New Mexico began last week in Santa Fe then continued in Carlsbad on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Students from several Las Cruces schools joined the movement Monday by walking out of classes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some carried signs that read "More teaching, less testing," and "Out the door with Common Core."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Santa Fe walkouts sparked students at Highland High School to stage their own protest, 16-year-old Highland student Connor Guiney said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"It's an excess of time being used and an unfair evaluation of teachers," Guiney said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We don't appreciate that and we wanted to make a stand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>New Mexico Education Secretary Hanna Skandera said the exams would provide useful results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"PARCC also takes the necessary step of raising expectations," she wrote in an Albuquerque Journal opinion piece published Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Skandera said the test isn't an additional exam, just a better version of the state standards exam it replaced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Some opponents would prefer an exam that samples random students to offer a snapshot without such high stakes attached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Others support rating schools through an accreditation process such as ones used by colleges and universities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Accreditation includes site visits, in-depth analysis and a detailed action plan.</td></tr>
