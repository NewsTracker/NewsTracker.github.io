<h3>NFL finds Patriots employees probably deflated balls (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady speaks at a news conference in Foxborough, Mass., Thursday, Jan. 22, 2015 as he addresses the issue of the NFL investigation of deflated footballs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- An NFL investigation released Wednesday said that New England Patriots employees likely deflated footballs used in the AFC Championship and that quarterback Tom Brady was probably ''at least generally aware'' of the rules violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The NFL began investigating after the Patriots defeated the Colts 45-7 on January 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Colts complained that several footballs were under inflated and the NFL confirmed that 11 of the 12 footballs were under the limit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The investigation started as the Patriots were preparing for the Super Bowl - which they won two weeks later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Footballs with less pressure can be easier to grip and catch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some quarterbacks prefer footballs that have less air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The NFL requires balls to be inflated between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch, and each team is responsible for the balls it uses on offense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Brady said he prefers footballs inflated to 12.5 pounds per square inch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On many occasions, Brady said he never asked for balls to be deflated outside of the rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The NFL report said ''it was more than probable'' that Jim McNally, the officials locker room attendant, and John Jastremski, an equipment assistant for the Patriots, were involved in ''a deliberate effort to release air'' from the footballs after they were examined by the referee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The report includes text messages between McNally and Jastremski that imply Brady was requesting footballs deflated below 12.5 pounds per square inch.</td></tr>
