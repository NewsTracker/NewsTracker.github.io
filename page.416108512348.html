<h3>Durst pleads not guilty to gun charges in New Orleans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A frail-looking Robert Durst pleaded not guilty Thursday to felony gun possession charges in Louisiana Criminal Court, nearly a month after his arrest in the Big Easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Durst, 71, wearing a neon yellow jumpsuit, had to be held up by two of his lawyers as he moved toward the podium and had a hard time hearing as he was arraigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I didn't hear," Durst said in a high-pitched voice when Orleans Parish Criminal District Court Judge Franz Zilbich asked him how he wanted to plead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After lead defense lawyer Dick DeGuerin whispered in his ear, Durst finally said, "I am not guilty, your honor."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Before his arraignment, Durst, who appeared to be disoriented, peered over his shoulder at the crowd of reporters seated in the gallery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The millionaire real estate heir was indicted Wednesday on charges of possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon in the presence of a controlled dangerous substance stemming from a search of his New Orleans hotel room March 14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He had been picked up on a murder warrant out of Los Angeles, where he is accused of murdering a longtime female friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His lawyers have argued that two FBI agents conducted the search illegally without a proper arrest warrant in hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The agents were subpoenaed to testify at a hearing last week but were advised not to show up because they weren't prepared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>DeGuerin said in court Thursday that he wants both agents present at an evidentiary hearing in criminal court May 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We ran into a stunt," said DeGuerin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Durst will also appear in New Orleans federal court later Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He is being held without bail and will have to answer to charges there before he is extradited to Los Angeles for the murder rap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Jamie Landry-Zimmer reported from New Orleans.</td></tr>
