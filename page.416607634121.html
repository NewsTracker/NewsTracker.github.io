<h3>1st meeting of split Cyprus' rival leaders meeting postponed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - A Cypriot government official says the first meeting between the country's Greek Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades and the newly elected Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci has been postponed until next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Government spokesman Nicos Christodoulides said Tuesday that the meeting, which had been tentatively set for Saturday, said the reasons for the postponement are "not considered of substance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Akinci, a left-wing moderate with a long track record of reaching out to Greek Cypriots, easily defeated the hard-line incumbent in Sunday's vote in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north of divided Cyprus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The meeting is seen as preparing the ground for the resumption of stalled negotiations aimed at reunifying the country, split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.</td></tr>
