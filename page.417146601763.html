<h3>Scare on Yahoo's Alibaba Spin-Off Seen Premature</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yahoo Inc's (YHOO) planned spin-off of its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) is likely to proceed on a tax-free basis, analysts said, as Yahoo shares regained most of their losses after concerns of a possible change in U.S. tax rules spurred a slide on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The stock closed up $1.81 to $42.73 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It fell $3.38 on Tuesday, wiping more than $3 billion off its market value after a U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) official said it may consider a change to its spin-off rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Anything can happen, but I'm going with the bet that this won't impact spin-off of Alibaba shares for Yahoo," Axiom Capital analyst Victor Anthony told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A tax-free spin-off of the Alibaba stake was "more than likely", Raymond James analysts said but reduced its probability estimate to 60 percent from 80 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A change in tax rules, however, will pose some risk to the company's ability to spin off Yahoo Japan, Anthony said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The search giant said last month it had hired advisers to help evaluate options for its Yahoo Japan stake, which analysts estimate could fetch more than $5 billion after tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Yahoo plans to spin off a $34 billion stake in Alibaba into a public company along with Yahoo Small Business that provides domain names and local marketing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It submitted a request to the IRS in the first quarter regarding the spin-off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Current rules make a spin-off tax free if the entity being separated has an active business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If taxed at the full 40 percent rate, Yahoo shares would be worth just about $20 billion, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Peck wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The IRS, however, was unlikely to announce such a major change through a "non-senior" official at a Washington, D.C. Bar Association event, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Yahoo was working to complete the spin-off in the fourth quarter, a spokesperson said on Wednesday, adding that the IRS said requests already in process would not be frozen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There is some government suspicion that the Yahoo spinco is merely a shell for its investment holdings and that new guidelines could establish new rules of the road for spinoffs and active business levels," Guggenheim Securities analyst Chris Krueger wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Yahoo Small Business has about $50 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even if IRS changes its rules and deems Yahoo's planned spin-off taxable, the search giant may find ways to soften the blow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Yahoo can get a similar result by spinning out its core business, leaving behind the so-called active business with its untaxed Asian assets, Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A sale of all of Yahoo, possibly to Alibaba, was also an option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Alibaba CEO Jack Ma could buy Yahoo in a cash-and-stock deal, claw back the stock and essentially cancel the shares that he just issued, BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Because of the tax advantage that he would receive in doing that, he would be a bidder that no other bidder could be."</td></tr>
