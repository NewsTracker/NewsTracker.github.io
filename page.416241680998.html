<h3>Mexico oil spill affects drinking water for Tabasco city</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The spill late last week sent workers with the state-owned oil company scrambling to limit damage, and four of Villahermosa's water treatment plants were shut down as a precaution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Tabasco state government said Tuesday that it will temporarily supply water using 13 tanker trucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Workers for the Pemex oil company set out containment booms and were trying to scoop oil off the waterways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Illegal pipeline taps have caused fires, explosions and spills in Mexico in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They became so frequent that Pemex no longer ships finished, usable fuels through pipelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Peel the feijoas and put in a saucepan with the sugar, riesling, water and lemon.</td></tr>
