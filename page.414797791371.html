<h3>Egypt strikes ISIL group in Libya after video of mass beheading</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt's army warplanes carried out airstrikes in neighboring Libya against areas claimed by affiliates of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) on Monday in Derna, Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Egyptian jets bombed Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) targets in Libya on Monday, a day after the release of a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians, drawing Cairo directly into the conflict across its border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sources told Al Jazeera on Monday that at least seven civilians, including three children, were killed by the blasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Libya's air force also participated in Monday's attack on Derna - an eastern coastal city seen as a base for ISIL fighters in the oil-rich nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While Cairo is believed to have provided clandestine support to a Libyan general fighting a rogue government in Tripoli, the mass killings pushed Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi into open action, expanding his battle against radical groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cairo is also calling for international intervention in Libya against ISIL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Loyalists of the Syria- and Iraq-based group have risen to dominate several cities in the chaos-riven North African nation, just across the Mediterranean Sea from Italy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After the release of the beheading video Sunday night, the tiny Christian-majority home village of more than half of the 21 Egyptians was gutted by grief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Inside the village church, relatives wept and shouted the names of the dead in shock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"What will be a relief to me is to take a hold of his murderer, tear him apart, eat up his flesh and liver," said Bushra Fawzi in el-Aour village, as he wept over the loss of his 22-year-old son Shenouda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I want his body back. If they dumped it in the sea, I want it back. If they set fire to it, I want its dust."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The 21 victims - mainly young men from impoverished families - had traveled to Libya for work and were kidnapped in two groups in December and January from the coastal city of Sirte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In the video, the group is marched onto what is purported to be a Libyan beach before masked figures with knives behead them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The killing of at least a dozen of them is clearly visible, though it is not clear from the video whether all 21 hostages were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Monday morning, an Egyptian armed forces spokesman announced the strikes over state radio, marking the first time Cairo has publicly acknowledged taking military action in neighboring Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The statement said the warplanes targeted weapons caches and training camps before returning safely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Libya's air force commander, Saqr al-Joroushi, told Egyptian state TV that the air strikes were coordinated with the Libyan side and that they killed about 50 ISIL-linked fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The strikes hit four positions in the eastern Libyan city of Derna, taken over by an ISIL affiliate last year, a Libyan security official told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The airstrikes hit their targets precisely, and the falcons of our air forces returned safely to their base," said an Egyptian military statement issued shortly after the strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Libya's air force said it had carried out its own strikes in Derna, without providing further details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It said the "intense strikes" were "to avenge the bloodshed and to seek retribution from the killers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After the strikes, Sisi spoke with France's president and Italy's prime minister about the Libya situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He sent his foreign minister, Sameh Shukri, to New York to hold consultations with United Nations officials and Security Council members ahead of a conference opening Wednesday in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"What is happening in Libya is a threat to international peace and security," said Sisi, who also banned all travel to Libya by Egyptian citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Egypt's Foreign Ministry said the international community must adopt "immediate and effective" moves against such groups in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Leaving things in Libya as they are without decisive intervention to suppress these terror groups constitutes a clear danger to international peace and security," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It also called on the U.S.-led coalition staging airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria to offer Egypt political and material support to counter the threat posed by the group's affiliates in Libya.</td></tr>
