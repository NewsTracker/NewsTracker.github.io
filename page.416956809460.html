<h3>Eurozone economy grows at fastest rate in nearly 2 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) " The eurozone economy grew at its fastest rate for nearly two years during the first three months of 2015 thanks to a raft of favorable conditions such as the sharp fall in oil prices, official figures showed Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 0.4 percent quarterly increase in economic output across the 19-country bloc was up from the 0.3 percent recorded in the previous quarter and in line with expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It matches the rate recorded when the eurozone emerged from its longest-ever recession in the second quarter of 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Still, the rate is likely to be a slight disappointment to many policymakers across the region considering the beneficial backdrop for the eurozone economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The bloc has enjoyed a series of tail winds such as a fall in oil prices, which acts like a tax cut for businesses and consumers, and the export-boosting drop in the value of the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To cap it all off, the European Central Bank launched its long-awaited 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) monetary stimulus to keep a lid on interest rates in the markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The overall growth figure also masks some disappointments in specific countries, such as Greece's return to recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece, which is in the midst of protracted bailout talks with creditors that may see it leaving the euro, saw its economy shrink by 0.2 percent in the first three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Following the 0.4 percent contraction in the last quarter of 2014, Greece is now technically back in recession barely a year after it emerged from a downturn as severe as the Great Depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Another disappointment was Germany, Europe's largest economy, which saw its quarterly growth rate decline to 0.3 percent from 0.7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Positive surprises came from France, which saw growth of 0.6 percent against a flat outcome in the last quarter of 2014, and Italy, which grew 0.3 percent, its first increase since the third quarter of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Perhaps the most notable increase was in Spain, which saw output expand by a robust 0.9 percent.</td></tr>
