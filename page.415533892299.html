<h3>Israel election: Netanyahu and center-left Herzog tied in exit polls</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>With Netanyahu and Herzog deadlocked, the coalition building begins Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Veteran politician Benjamin Netanyahu used every trick in the book Tuesday to pull his Likud party even with his principal opposition, the Zionist Union (ZU) led by Isaac Herzog, in an Israeli election marked by acrimony and accusations of racism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With ballots being counted through the night, exit polls showed the Likud and ZU tied with 27 seats apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Now comes the messy business of fashioning a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will give one of the two men the first opportunity to assemble a government of at least 61 seats, a majority in the 120-seat Knesset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With at least eight other parties vying for positions in cabinet, the bartering will be fierce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A new centrist party, Kulanu, led by a disgruntled former Likud minister, may cast the deciding vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While many days of difficult negotiations lie ahead, Mr. Netanyahu has a better-than-even chance to form a workable coalition and claim a fourth term as prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At the end of last week, the country's major public-opinion surveys all had Likud trailing by as many as four seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A last-minute anti-Arab campaign intended to strike fear in the hearts of many Jewish Israeli voters appears to have made the difference in drawing supporters back to Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Soon after polling stations opened, Mr. Netanyahu sounded the alarm in a dramatic video on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The rule of the right wing is in danger," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Arab voters are going to the polls in droves!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Go to the polling stations! Vote Likud!" he told the people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The element of fear seems to have succeeded and the number of voters increased substantially later in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Against all odds: a great victory for Likud a great victory for the people of Israel," Mr. Netanyahu crowed on his official Twitter account on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The night before, in his campaign's final official rally, Mr. Netanyahu reassured doubters on the right by recanting his 2009 commitment to negotiate a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Such an entity will not be created, he said, as long as he is in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>While Tuesday's anti-Arab rhetoric drew strong rebukes for racism, and the repudiation of a Palestinian state puts Israel on a collision course with the United States, the tactics appear to have worked and the Likud vote surged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Much of it came at the expense of the Jewish Home Party, a pro-settler right-wing party led by Mr. Netanyahu's one-time chief of staff, Naftali Bennett, which finished with just eight seats, according to the exit polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>On Friday, surveys showed Mr. Bennett's party in contention for third place with 13 projected seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In the closing days of the campaign, the veteran Mr. Netanyahu had targeted Mr. Bennett, saying that a right-wing government was only possible if the Likud leader got more votes than the centre-left leader, Mr. Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The people on the right listened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Yet, the first phone call Mr. Netanyahu said he made after the exit polls were announced was to Mr. Bennett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The two agreed, he said, to initiate accelerated negotiations to establish a right-wing government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>To form a working majority, Mr. Netanyahu needs at least 61 seats - with Mr. Bennett's party, he has 35.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Assuming he can convince Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman to return, Mr. Netanyahu will pick up five more seats, making a total of 40.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>At the same time Mr. Herzog, though clearly wounded by last-minute developments, vowed late Tuesday night to "make every effort to form a real socially-minded government for Israel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He told reporters he already had begun discussion with other party leaders about putting together such a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>With his own bloc's 27 seats, Mr. Herzog can count on the support of the left-wing Meretz party, with its five seats, as well as likely gaining the support of the centrist Yesh Atid party that looks to have 12 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>With those parties in hand, Mr. Herzog has 44 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It all comes down to Israel's two main ultra-Orthodox parties, with six and seven seats, and the new Kulanu party led by former communications minister Moshe Kahlon, which looks to be getting 10 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>These are the parties that are likely to make or break a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Israeli President Rivlin seems intent on fashioning a coalition of his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>No sooner had the exit polls announced a virtual tie between the top two blocs when Mr. Rivlin issued a statement: "I am convinced," he said, "that only a unity government can prevent the rapid disintegration of Israel's democracy and new elections in the near future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>By "unity government" Mr. Rivlin, a long-time Likud speaker of the Knesset, is referring to a government in which the top two parties are included, and a minimum number of other parties are added to give the coalition a majority in the Knesset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The belief is that such a government, comprised of fewer, larger parties, will be more stable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>In theory such a government would leave out extremists and the chances of early dissolution from a government collapse are greatly reduced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Such a government was established at the time of the 1967 Six Day War, and another in 1984, when Likud and Labour joined together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In that latter example the two parties even rotated the premiership, with Labour leader Shimon Peres running the government for two years, and Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir running things for the other two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In the current situation, while Mr. Herzog and Mr. Netanyahu may agree on fundamental matters such as the threat from Iran and the need for economic reforms, it is difficult to see the two sides agreeing on how to approach the issue of settlements on the West Bank and the creation of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Left-wing leaders have attempted to discourage Mr. Herzog from entertaining the idea of a unity government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Some have pointed to the extreme tactics employed by Mr. Netanyahu Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Shelly Yachimovich, the former Labour Party leader, denounced Mr. Netanyahu for his "racist" remark about Arab citizens going to the polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>No Western leader would have uttered such a racist remark, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"Imagine a warning that begins with 'the rule is endangered. Black voters are heading in droves to the polls,'" she wrote on her Twitter feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>For their part, Palestinians have expressed disgust with the whole affair and vowed to pursue their efforts at obtaining international recognition of their state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"It is clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will form the next government," Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"So we say clearly that we will go to the International Criminal Court in the Hague and we will speed up, pursue and intensify" all diplomatic efforts to achieve statehood.</td></tr>
