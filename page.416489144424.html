<h3>Ex-CIA man convicted of Iran leak seeks lenient sentence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ALEXANDRIA, Virginia (AP) " Lawyers for a former CIA officer convicted of leaking details of a secret mission to derail Iran's nuclear ambitions say he deserves a light sentence similar to that just handed down to ex-CIA director David Petraeus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jeffrey Sterling will be sentenced next month in federal court in Alexandria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Friday, his lawyers urged a lenient sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They said a recommendation under federal sentencing guidelines for a term of 20 years or more is excessive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The lawyers say similar leaks have resulted in far lighter sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Petraeus was sentenced Thursday to two years' probation for giving classified material to his biographer and former mistress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Former CIA veteran John Kiriakou received a sentence of 2 1/2 years for leaking a covert officer's identity.</td></tr>
