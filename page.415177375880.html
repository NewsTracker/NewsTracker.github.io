<h3>Former CIA director Petraeus pleads guilty to federal charge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Petraeus to plead guilty to sharing 'black books' with mistress Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>David Petraeus, the best-known military commander of his generation, has reached a plea deal with the U.S. Justice Department and admitted providing his highly classified journals to a mistress when he was the director of the CIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr. Petraeus has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, a misdemeanour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He is eligible for up to one year in prison, but prosecutors will recommend two years of probation and a $40,000 (U.S.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The plea deal completes a spectacular fall for Mr. Petraeus, a retired four-star general who was once discussed as a possible candidate for vice-president or even president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He led the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was the architect of a counterinsurgency strategy that at one time seemed a model for future warfare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the deal also ends two years of uncertainty and allows Mr. Petraeus to focus on his lucrative post-government career as a partner in a private equity firm and a worldwide speaker on national security issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Even while under investigation, he has advised the White House on Iraq and terrorism issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The mistress, Paula Broadwell, is a former Army Reserve officer who had an affair with Mr. Petraeus in 2011, when she was interviewing him for a biography, All In: The Education of General David Petraeus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>During one of the interviews for that book, Ms. Broadwell asked about his "black books," the notebooks that contained handwritten classified notes about official meetings, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and the names of cover officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"They are highly classified, some of them," Mr. Petraeus replied, according to an excerpt from the taped interview included in court documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Three weeks later, Mr. Petraeus e-mailed Ms. Broadwell and agreed to share the black books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He gave them to her the next day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When questioned by the FBI, Mr. Petraeus denied providing Ms. Broadwell with classified information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"These statements were false," federal prosecutors wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Defendant David Howell Petraeus then and there knew that he previously shared the black books with his biographer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A lawyer for Mr. Petraeus did not respond to a message seeking comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr. Petraeus resigned as the director of the CIA in 2012, three days after President Barack Obama was re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At the time, Mr. Petraeus acknowledged the affair, but denied any criminal wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The plea deal spares Mr. Petraeus a high-profile trial where embarrassing details about the affair would have been presented to the jury and made public.</td></tr>
