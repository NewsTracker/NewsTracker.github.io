<h3>Iraqi forces try to seal off Islamic State around Tikrit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, who has helped coordinate Baghdad's counter-attacks against Islamic State since it seized much of northern Iraq in June, was overseeing at least part of the operation, witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His presence on the frontline highlights neighboring Iran's influence over the Shiite fighters who have been key to containing the militants in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In contrast the U.S.-led air coalition which has been attacking Islamic State across Iraq and Syria has not yet played a role in Tikrit, the Pentagon said Monday, perhaps in part because of the high-level Iranian presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Iraqi military officials said security forces backed by the Shiite militia known as Hashid Shaabi (Popular Mobilization) units were advancing gradually, their progress slowed by roadside bombs and snipers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They have yet to enter Tikrit, best known as the hometown of executed former President Saddam Hussein, or the nearby Tigris River town of al-Dour, which officials describe as a major center for the Islamic State fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On the southern flank of the offensive, army and police officials said government forces moving north from the city of Samarra could launch an attack on al-Dour later Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, was directing operations on the eastern flank from a village about 55 km from Tikrit called Albu Rayash, captured from Islamic State two days ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With him were two Iraqi Shiite paramilitary leaders: the leader of the Hashid Shaabi, Abu Mahdi al-Mohandis, and Hadi al-Amiri who leads the Badr Organization, a powerful Shiite militia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"(Soleimani) was standing on top of a hill pointing with his hands toward the areas where Islamic State are still operating," said a witness who was accompanying security forces near Albu Rayash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The offensive is the biggest military operation in the Salahuddin region north of Baghdad since last summer, when Islamic State fighters killed hundreds of Iraqi soldiers who had abandoned their military base at Camp Speicher outside Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Several Shiite Hashid Shaabi fighters have described this week's campaign as revenge for the Speicher killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has urged them to protect civilians in Salahuddin, a mainly Sunni Muslim province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The drive follows several failed attempts to push the militants out of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since Islamic State declared a caliphate last year in territories under its control in Iraq and Syria, Iraqi forces have not managed to recapture and control a single city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But months of U.S.-led airstrikes, backed up by the Shiite militias, Kurdish peshmerga fighters and Iraqi soldiers, have contained Islamic State in Iraq and pushed it back from around Baghdad, the Kurdish north, and the eastern province of Diyala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Tikrit battle will have a major impact on plans to move further north and recapture Mosul, the largest city under Islamic State rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If the offensive stalls, it will complicate and delay a move on Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A quick victory would give Baghdad momentum, but any retribution against local Sunnis would imperil efforts to win over Mosul's mainly Sunni population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>To the west of Mosul, Islamic State fighters attacked Kurdish forces in the town of Sinjar on Monday, a senior peshmerga source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Nine peshmerga and 45 militants were killed in the fighting, which began with a suicide car bomb in the Nasr quarter of the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Islamic State "wants to show people they can still attack and inflict losses on the peshmerga," the source said.</td></tr>

<h3>Volcano erupts in Chile, prompting thousands of evacuations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One of South America's most active volcanoes erupted early Tuesday in southern Chile, spewing heavy smoke into the air as lava surged down its slopes, prompting authorities to evacuate thousands of people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Villarrica volcano erupted around 3 a.m. local time, according to the National Emergency Office, which issued a red alert and ordered evacuations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Local media showed images of the volcano bursting at the top, glowing in the dark amid heavy smoke and rivers of lava.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Authorities worried that mudslides caused by melting snow could endanger nearby communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 9,000 foot (2,847-meter) volcano in Chile's central valley, 400 miles (670 kilometres) south of Santiago, sits above the small city of Pucon, which has a population of about 22,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen," 29-year-old Australian tourist Travis Armstrong said in a telephone interview from Pucon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I've never seen a volcano erupt and it was spewing lava and ash hundreds of meters into the air. Lightning was striking down at the volcano from the ash cloud that formed from the eruption."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chilean authorities had issued an orange alert on Monday because of increased activity at the volcano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>About 3,500 people have been evacuated so far, including tourists, said Interior and Security Minister Rodrigo Penailillo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Penailillo warned that the eruption was causing numerous rivers in the area to rise as snow along the sides of the volcano began melting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Villarrica is covered by a glacier cap covering some 40 square kilometres (15 square miles) and snow from about 1,500 metres (about 5,000 feet) on up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Authorities were keeping an eye on four nearby communities that could be endangered by mudslides as the snow melts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>President Michelle Bachelet arrived in Pucon amid cheers and boos later Tuesday to check on safety preparations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Witnesses said Pucon looked like a deserted town at dawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But as the volcanic activity decreased, some local residents had decided to return to their homes, more cars were seen in the streets, and some people had even decided to sunbathe at a nearby lake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Jose Manuel Reyes, the 37-year-old manager of La Bicicleta hostal in downtown Pucon, said visitors from France, Canada, Australian, South Africa and Brazil watched the early morning eruption from the building's terrace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We're still a bit nervous because we don't know what's happening," said Reyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There was nervousness, but we haven't seen any panic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tourists flock to the area around Villarrica for outdoor activities like kayaking, horseback riding, fishing and hiking around the volcano, which last had a major eruption in 1984.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Dozens of tourists were among those evacuated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Villarrica has a crater of about 200 metres (yards) in diameter and a lake of lava about 150 metres (yards) deep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It has periodic eruptions every 10 or 15 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Chile has more than 2,000 volcanoes in the Andes cordillera and about 90 of them remain active.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Villarrica is considered among the country's most dangerous.</td></tr>
