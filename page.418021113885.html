<h3>Virtually climb El Capitan with Google's first vertical Street View</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lynn Hill is one of the climbers featured in Google's vertical Street View of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google Maps has announced its first vertical Street View, giving people the opportunity to virtually climb El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"People around the world will now be able to virtually experience the unique act of ascending a 3,000-foot cliff by going on a self-directed, vertical climb," the Mountain View, Calif., company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Climbers" can make their way up the Nose route and part of the Dawn Wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google's Chief Executive Larry Page has announced the tech giant's latest moonshot, a new company whose mission is to revolutionize urban life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To collect the imagery for Google Maps, the company worked with photographers and partnered with climbers Lynn Hill, Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Yosemite's driven so much of my life that I'm excited to be able to share it with the world through my eyes," Caldwell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"These 360-degree panoramic images are the closest thing I've ever witnessed to actually being thousands of feet up a vertical rock face -- better than any video or photo. But my hope is that this new imagery will inspire you to get out there and see Yosemite for yourself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>To check out more of Caldwell's experience working with Google, including the challenges of capturing the difficult ascent up the famous rock face, you can read his blog post here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For now, vertical Street View is available only for El Capitan, but Google spokeswoman Susan Cadrecha said the company would "continue to try and expand the limits -- and reach new heights -- for Street View moving forward."</td></tr>
