<h3>Moments of joy in Nepal as 2 are rescued 5 days after quake</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal - The 15-year-old boy had been buried alive under the rubble of this quake-stricken capital for five days, listening to bulldozers clearing mountains of debris, fearful the incessant aftershocks might finally collapse the darkened crevice he was trapped in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And then, "all of the sudden I saw light," Pempa Tamang said, recounting the moment Thursday he was pulled from a hole at the bottom of what was once a seven-story building in Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tamang did not know whether he was alive or dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I thought I was hallucinating," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The improbable rescue was an uplifting moment in Nepal, which has been overwhelmed by death and destruction since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>By late Thursday, the government said the toll from the tremor, the most powerful recorded here since 1934, had risen to 6,130 dead and 13,827 injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After night fell, police reported another dramatic rescue: A woman in her 20s, Krishna Devi Khadka, was pulled from a building in the same neighborhood as Tamang near Kathmandu's main bus terminal, according to an officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Life has become a struggle to survive. It gives us hope," said Hans Raj Joshi, who watched Tamang's rescue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We thought they were only bringing out the dead. It's hard to believe people are still alive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When Tamang was finally extricated, rescue workers inserted an IV in his arm, propped him onto a yellow plastic stretcher - the same kind that has helped convey countless dead - and carried him through the ruins on their shoulders as if he was a newly crowned king.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Lines of police stood on both sides, keeping back mobs of bystanders and journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A dazed Tamang, wearing a dark shirt with the New York Yankees logo and the words "New York Authentic," blinked at the bright sky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When the procession turned a corner and entered the main road outside, there was a sound Kathmandu hadn't heard in days: the jubilant cheers of thousands of ecstatic onlookers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For days, Tamang survived on two cans of ghee, or clarified butter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He rested his head on chunks of concrete and broken piece of corrugated aluminum roof.</td></tr>
