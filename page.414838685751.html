<h3>'Breakthrough' NSA spyware shows deep grasp of makers' hard drives</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>What seems to be a U.S.-run computer espionage program has reportedly figured out how to employ a "breakthrough" snooping tactic - the implanting of spyware into hard drives - that could compromise most of the world's computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As a matter of policy, Kaspersky Lab, which publicized the discovery in a report on Monday, withheld the name of the country it suspects of being behind the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the Moscow-based anti-virus company said the country behind the implanted spyware was closely linked to Stuxnet, the computer worm deployed by the U.S. National Security Agency to disable Iran's nuclear-enrichment capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Former NSA operatives confirmed to Reuters that the analysis by Kaspersky, a highly reputable anti-virus firm, was correct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They said the NSA's ability to secretly embed spyware into hard drives has long been prized by the surveillance agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While the scope of the operation isn't fully understood yet, Kaspersky's chief malware analyst and other cybersecurity experts helped explain what's contained in the report, how the spyware works and why the revelations may have caught so many by surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>How is this spyware unique?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cybersecurity researchers have detected malware - foreign software that's intended to disable or take over a computer - on computer operating systems in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But this presents a new level of sophistication that Kaspersky's principal security researcher Vitaly Kamluk calls "revolutionary."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Until now, we've never seen malware get to the micro-code, the microsystem running the hard drive itself," Kamluk said from Singapore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To implant spyware on hard drives would require the device's source code - the raw written backbone of software that users would never see - and perhaps product blueprints that "only manufacturers would have access to," Kamluk said, suggesting such proprietary information could only be obtained through limited means.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Any errors in the implanted malware, he added, would "completely destroy" a hard drive, rendering a computer useless and unable to boot up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>How widespread is the malware?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>By its estimation, Kaspersky Lab says the program causes about 2,000 infections per month, with targets belonging to the telecom, aerospace, energy, military and nuclear research sectors, as well as governments and financial institutions, among others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kaspersky Lab counted about 500 known victims worldwide, but Kamluk estimates this may represent less than 10 per cent of computers with compromised "firmware."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The espionage program appears to be fairly targeted, said Chris Parsons, an expert on state surveillance tools with the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab."This is what we can count," a Kaserpsky spokesperson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Because of [the] self-destroying function of the malware, the number [of victims] could be much higher."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Realistically, that's a comparatively small number when you look at the global population of computers that are sold," Parsons said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Canada was not identified as one of the nations that has been targeted by the tampered hard drives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>What is firmware?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Firmware is software that enables a computer to perform its basic functions, Parsons explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It's essentially the operating code that runs the devices in your computer," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Think of it as the base code that's used to run the hardware. Once the firmware is running ... all the pieces of your computer get activated and are able to function."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A bluetooth module in a laptop, a smartphone, a hard drive, and a computer motherboard all contain firmware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Firmware launches every time a computer is turned on, making it a coveted piece of PC real estate for hackers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tom Keenan, a Calgary cybersecurity expert and fellow with the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute, said the "all-powerful" functions of firmware would make it a big game catch for cyberthieves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"There's no anti-virus program, no software that can protect you from someone who's going to attack your firmware because all those programs have to talk to the firmware, and the firmware is doing what it pleases," Keenan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Command over firmware would effectively hand hackers the controls to a computer, allowing files to be stolen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"You could even modify firmware on your computer so that every keystroke is captured and sent somewhere," Keenan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Why is this considered a breakthrough?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>For those in cybersecurity, the possibility of exploiting firmware on disk drives is a big deal because it would affect almost the entire computer market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Kaspersky's analysis suggests the spyware could work on popular hard drives manufactured by Western Digital, Seagate Technology, Toshiba, IBM, Micron Technology and Samsung.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"The value of getting in before everything else loads is you can influence what loads, how it loads, when it loads, and the value is much higher than if you waited until the operating system booted up," Parsons said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That's because most anti-virus programs tend to be designed to take action following the loading of firmware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>This particular program, however, would be "masked" in the firmware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Which users might be affected by this?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Parsons points out that so far all the malware collected has been designed to work with Microsoft Windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>One of the characteristics of this malware was to modify the sensor instructions to make the changes to the firmware "almost impossible to detect," Parsons explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"So by the time you go to boot into Windows, it's already compromised, and this has been hidden for at least eight to 14 years," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Some of the malware plugins, according to the Kaspersky report, were originally designed for use on Windows 95 computers, while others can target operating systems running Windows 7, which was released in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Non-Windows targets may also be vulnerable, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The report mentions that victims in China who use Mac OS X computers may have been targeted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The NSA has not commented on the report, and top manufacturers of hard drives have so far declined to say whether they share source codes with government agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Western Digital said it never provided its source code with any government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Parsons anticipates hackers will be emboldened by the report's findings.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt pushes for UN-backed intervention against Libya jihadists</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said "there is no choice" but to create a global coalition to confront the extremists in Libya after Cairo launched air strikes in retaliation for the jihadist group's beheading of Egyptian Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The matter will be taken up by the UN Security Council on Wednesday after a request by Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, who is seeking backing for military intervention and to "full support" against the jihadists, his ministry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Arab diplomats have expressed support for Egypt's request, but said they thought it would also require formal backing from Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That could prove difficult to secure, however, as Libya currently has two rival parliaments and governments -- one side with ties to Islamists and the other recognised by the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Western powers also seemed to distance themselves from the calls for military action, saying a UN-backed attempt to get Libya's warring sides to negotiate was the "best hope" for peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain in a statement released by Rome said the recent beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians showed "once again the urgent need for a political solution to the conflict".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cairo's diplomatic push comes a day after Egyptian F-16s bombed militant bases in Derna and on the fourth anniversary of the beginning of the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that ousted dictator Moamer Kadhafi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The raids were ordered hours after IS in Libya released a gruesome video showing the beheadings of 21 Coptic Christians who were in the North African country seeking work and were captured by the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Cairo is encouraging the hundreds of thousands of Egyptians still in Libya to leave, said foreign ministry spokesman Badr Abdelatty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Libya has been gripped by turmoil since Kadhafi's overthrow and Egypt has long said the NATO intervention to help the rebels left it to contend with chaos on its western border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The mission was not finished," Abdelatty said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>France, which agreed Monday to sell Egypt advanced Rafale warplanes, has called with Cairo on the UN to adopt measures to confront the jihadists in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Italy also ruled out intervention without UN backing and suggested a political solution remained the best option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The breakdown of government in the former Italian colony has contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of African and Middle Eastern migrants and refugees arriving on its shores by sea after transiting through Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The European Union said it would discuss joint action on Libya with the Egyptian and US governments this week, but that it saw no role in any military intervention for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Chaos in Libya has seen the rival governments and powerful militias battling for key cities and the country's oil riches, providing fertile ground for IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Several Libyan groups have pledged allegiance to IS, which last year seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, declaring a "caliphate" and committing widespread atrocities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Delegates from Libya's rival parliaments held UN-mediated indirect talks this month described as positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But Egypt says it would be naive to hope for a speedy settlement, insisting the jihadists must be confronted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There are terrorist organisations in Libya that are not abiding by their commitments; they are not serious about dialogue," said Abdelatty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Monday's strikes were the first time Egypt announced military action against jihadists in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Last year it reportedly allowed the United Arab Emirates to use its bases to bomb militants there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Experts say Sisi wants to be seen as a key ally of the West against Islamist extremism, deflecting international criticism of his crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood of former president Mohamed Morsi, whom he ousted in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>As well as Libya to the west, Egypt is dealing with an insurgency in its own east, in the Sinai, where jihadists have also joined IS and killed scores of troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Abdelatty said it was time for the international effort against IS -- which has been hammered by US-led air strikes in Iraq and Syria -- to focus on its presence elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Just as there is movement against Daesh in Syria and Iraq, we want the world to turn its attention to Libya," he said, using an Arabic acronym for group.</td></tr>
