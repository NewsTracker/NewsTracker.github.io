<h3>Closing arguments set in trial over girl's running death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A woman facing a potential death penalty in the running death of her 9-year-old granddaughter could be convicted of lesser charges even if jurors believe she was to blame for the girl's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jurors will begin deliberations in the trial of Joyce Hardin Garrard, 49, following final instructions from the judge and closing arguments, set for Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Garrard is charged with capital murder in the 2012 death of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin, who prosecutors say was intentionally run to death as punishment for a lie about candy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If convicted on the capital charge, Garrard faces death or life without parole; jurors would make a recommendation and the final decision would be up to the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The judge has also indicated he will give jurors several options for a conviction on a lesser charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Garrard, of Boaz, testified she had no intention of harming the girl and denied she had forced her to run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Garrard said during cross examination that Savannah wanted Garrard to help her get faster for races at school, and they both ran "a bunch" before Savannah collapsed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jurors could acquit Garrard or also convict her on one of three reduced charges, according to instructions Etowah County Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree said he will deliver before deliberations begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>-Felony murder, which carries a sentence ranging from 10 years to 99 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>State law defines this as an intentional act that leads to a death or a death caused by "extreme indifference."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>-Manslaughter, a felony with a sentence ranging from two years to 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jurors would have to decide the girl died because of a reckless act, but not intentionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>-Criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This could be another option if jurors believe the girl's death wasn't intentional but that Garrard was responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Garrard already has been in jail awaiting trial for three years, and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Prosecutors contend Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson.</td></tr>

<h3>LA handwriting pros messed up in Durst murder case: docs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Back in 2001, when Los Angeles police were investigating the murder of Durst's longtime friend Susan Berman, document examiner William Leaver concluded that it was "highly probable" that a note they received tipping them off about her death was written by Nyle Brenner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Brenner, according to a timeline that accompanied a warrant to search Durst's Houston address, was Berman's manager and friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Leaver's conclusion was "rubber stamped" by a supervisor who did not check his work, the papers say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It wasn't until June 2003 that Leaver compared the block letters on the "cadaver" note and envelope, on which "Beverley Hills Police" was misspelled, to new samples of Durst's handwriting obtained a year earlier when LAPD met with the suspect and his lawyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Leaver then decided that Durst was the writer, the timeline says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>By then, Durst had been accused of murdering and dismembering Morris Black, his neighbor in Galveston, Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Durst was acquitted of killing Black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meanwhile, the telltale letter landed on the desk of California Department of Justice investigator Sean Espley, who concluded Durst was "probably the author of the cadaver letter and note," the timeline said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But for reasons not laid out in the paperwork, the Berman case went cold for more than a decade until investigators learned that Andrew Jarecki was making an HBO documentary, "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst," about the creepy cross-dressing scion of a Manhattan real estate empire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In it, Durst - also long suspected of killing first wife Kathie Durst - appeared to confess that he "killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In November, the LAPD had two independent examiners analyze the documents and both concluded Durst was the author, according to the search warrant affidavit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The LAPD has declined to comment on Durst until he is in their custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 71-year-old suspect, who was arrested Saturday in New Orleans, is being held in protective custody - his extradition delayed by an illegal gun and pot possession charge by local police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, told The Associated Press that the fact that the handwriting experts could not agree on who wrote the note "shows you what junk science really is."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Police in northern California, where Durst lived for a time, are also looking into whether he was involved in the 1997 disappearances of two teenage girls, Kristen Modafferi, 18, and Karen Mitchell, 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Durst's lawyers have said that he had nothing to do with the missing teens.</td></tr>
