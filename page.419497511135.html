<h3>Woods shares lead with Hoge entering 3rd round at Wyndham (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Tiger Woods has the most recognizable name in golf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Far fewer people know about rookie Tom Hoge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Including Woods himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They'll spend the third round together Saturday in a most unlikely final pairing at the Wyndham Championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Woods shot a 5-under 65 on Friday and shared the second-round lead with Hoge at 11-under 129.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hoge shot a 67.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They make quite the intriguing pair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Woods is chasing his first victory in more than two years, one that would undoubtedly send him into the FedEx Cup playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The 26-year-old Hoge spent the past three years on the Web.com Tour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This is his 27th career PGA Tour event - and all but one of those have come this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>When asked if he would recognize Hoge if he saw him, Woods responded: ''No, I wouldn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''I look on the Champions Tour leaderboard and I know every one of those guys because I played against them and I played with them,'' Woods said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Woods followed his best round since 2013 - a first-day 64 - with one almost as good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He made his big move up the leaderboard on the back nine, with birdies on Nos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>12 and 13 and an eagle on the par-5 15th that gave him a share of the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''I just couldn't get anything out of my rounds (before this tournament) and a couple lucky bounces here, take advantage of those opportunities - it's just the flow,'' Woods said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Davis Love III and Chad Campbell were one stroke back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Campbell shot 65 and Love had 66.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Brandt Snedeker matched the tournament record with a 61 that put him in a group of (six) players two strokes behind Woods and Hoge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But for the second straight day, the big story at Sedgefield Country Club was Woods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He had missed the cut in three straight majors and this year hasn't finished better than a tie for 17th at the Masters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>187 on the FedEx Cup points list, he would definitely crack the top 125 with a win and qualify for the Barclays next week in New Jersey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Depending on how the math works out, a solo second-place finish also might be enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He took advantage of some prime scoring conditions during the first round, shooting that 64 on a course softened by showers that morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>That left him two strokes off the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And then, playing under a hot afternoon sun that sped up those undulating greens, Woods almost matched it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''I wasn't quite as sharp as I was yesterday,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He capped that run of consecutive birdies with a 25-foot putt on the 13th that drew a mighty roar from the huge gallery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Then came his eagle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He placed his second shot about 10 feet behind the hole, and after his downhill putt fell into the hole, he followed with his trademark fist pump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>And as strong as his round was, it easily could have been even better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He settled for birdie on the par-5 fifth when his 10-foot eagle putt lipped out, then missed a 15-foot birdie putt on the next hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He left a 10-foot birdie putt an inch from the hole on the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''I've shot 59 and I left a couple shots out there,'' Woods said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Love, a former North Carolina player whose two wins in this tournament came across town at Forest Oaks Country Club, played a practice round with Woods on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Several times this week, Woods has referred to pointers Love gave him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Love reeled off three straight birdies early in his round before closing with 10 straight pars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''It will look boring on the card ... but I made some nice putts for par, and some good up and downs, and kept the round together,'' Love said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Hoge, who was born about 70 miles away in Statesville but grew up in North Dakota, shared the first-round lead with William McGirt and two-time heart transplant recipient Erik Compton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Hoge followed his opening-round 62 with another low number with birdies on three of his final five holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>''Obviously, a new position for me,'' Hoge said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Snedeker - who won the Wyndham in 2007, its last year at Forest Oaks - shot just the fifth 61 in the history of the event and the first since Tim Herron's three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>He finished his round with back-to-back birdies on the eighth and ninth holes, closing by sinking a 50-foot putt.</td></tr>
