<h3>Nemtsov's girlfriend didn't see killer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 55-year-old former deputy prime minister, long-time critic of President Vladimir Putin and anti-corruption crusader who was gunned down outside of the Kremlin walls late on Friday, will be buried in Moscow later on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The most shocking political murder of Putin's rule sent shockwaves across Russia and triggered international condemnation led by US President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Former British prime minister John Major was among the first to arrive at the Andrei Sakharov rights centre in central Moscow early on Tuesday, where Nemtsov's body lay in state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The slain politician's mother, Dina Eidman, who turned 87 on Tuesday, arrived wearing a black headscarf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich carried a bouquet of red roses as he walked in, as did former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, himself now an opposition leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Putin was not due to attend the funeral, with the Kremlin sending a low-level official instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We came because we feel ashamed of our country, of our people, that we let such a thing happen. It's our cruelty, our fear," said one of the mourners, Dmitry Afanasyev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Putin is to blame. But we are, too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's a shock. It's the system that killed him," said another mourner, Vladimir Shlamin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are against the system that kills great people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bach played in the background as well-wishers came up to the coffin to lay flowers, many crossing themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Pawlik was also set to attend as well as Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But several senior officials from Poland and Latvia said Monday they had been denied entry into Russia to attend the funeral in retaliation for EU sanctions over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nemtsov was gunned down just before midnight on Friday while walking across a bridge just a short distance from the Kremlin with his Ukrainian model girlfriend Ganna Duritska.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Putin, whose rule has seen the steady suppression of independent media, opposition political parties and independent-minded business figures, called the murder a "contract killing" and said it was a provocation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Investigators said Tuesday they had examined security camera footage and questioned witnesses and were going to carry out a number of forensic tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A reward of three million roubles ($A61,373.23) was offered for information on Nemtsov's death, a substantial amount in Moscow, where the average monthly salary is 60,000 roubles ($A1,227.46).</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Late Monday 23-year-old Duritska - the chief witness in the murder - was allowed to return to Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She said she had given all the information she could to investigators and did not plan to attend the funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Duritska said earlier she did not see where the assassin came from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But she did notice a light-coloured car quickly drive off, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Friends of Nemtsov said he had been working on a report containing what he described as proof of secret Russian military involvement in the bloody uprising by pro-Moscow militias in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
