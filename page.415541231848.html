<h3>Five ways victory for Israel's Netanyahu matters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Five ways victory for Israel's Netanyahu matters Five ways Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's victory matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party scored a resounding victory in the country's election, final results showed Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was a stunning turnaround after a tight race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Iran nuclear talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Israeli leader has been a strident critic of U.S. talks with Iran on curbing that country's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Back in power, he may work with fellow critics in the Republican-controlled Congress to undermine any agreement the U.S. reaches with Iran on the grounds that Iran can't be trusted to halt a program that could produce nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Peace talks have stalled under Netanyahu, who declared on the eve of the election that he would oppose the creation of a Palestinian state during a new term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If he keeps his word, that hard-line stance will be a roadblock to U.S. efforts to revive peace talks aimed at creating an independent state for Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Israeli settlements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Over U.S. objections, Netanyahu has allowed construction within existing settlements on land claimed by Palestinians as part of a future state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Back in office, Netanyahu would have no incentive to curb settlement activity opposed by President Obama but favored by Israeli nationalists who returned him to office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>U.S. relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Because of their many policy differences, Obama and Netanyahu have as bad a personal relationship as any U.S. and Israeli leader ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Now that Netanyahu is in line for a fourth term as prime minister, it could be a miserable final two years for Obama when Mideast issues arise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Israel's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Netanyahu's party won despite unhappiness among Israelis with the high cost of living under his free-market economic policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But after a pre-election scare that he might lose because of bread-and-butter issues, Netanyahu may push for higher wages or a better social safety net to make necessities more affordable.</td></tr>
