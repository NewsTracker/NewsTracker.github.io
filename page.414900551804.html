<h3>Russia is sending more tanks and troops into Ukraine to take the next battlefront, Kiev says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Only about 1000 of the town's pre-war population of 27,000 remained, most of them elderly people too infirm or too stubborn to leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Out for the first time after a week of shelling and street fighting, they moved about in groups, with blackened faces and gritty clothes, busily scavenging for food in the ruins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The last week was just horrible," said Vasily Yegelsky, 77, a retiree who was limping along in the morning sunshine, headed to the outskirts of town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Out there, where Ukrainian soldiers were dug in for months before retreating in haste on Wednesday in the face of an assault by Russian-backed separatists, Mr Yegelsky and others wandered through abandoned trenches, looking for something to eat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bloody shreds of mattress hung from tree limbs, and stray dogs skulked nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But also strewn about were canned foods and much-prized bags of macaroni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As they picked through the detritus of war, they talked darkly of bodies lying uncollected in the streets through the fighting, of the sick and wounded stranded in basements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As yet there is no reliable estimate of the civilian casualties; European monitors with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe were not due to arrive until Saturday local time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But judging by the scenes of destruction, it is likely to add significantly to a wartime toll that the United Nations estimates at more than 5600 soldiers and civilians since combat began in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Debaltseve was under Ukrainian control when Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Francois Hollande of France brokered a ceasefire between Ukraine and the rebels in Minsk, Belarus, on February 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Friday, at a news conference in Paris, the beleaguered leaders insisted that the terms of the ceasefire be honoured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The ceasefire has been violated several times," Mr Hollande said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It must now be fully respected along the entire front line."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But according to Ukraine, it is serving purely as diplomatic cover while the rebels, and Russia, pursue their war aims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In recent days, despite the Minsk agreement, military equipment and ammunition have been sighted crossing from Russia into Ukraine," said the Ukrainian military's spokesman, Andriy Lysenko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said more than 20 Russian tanks, 10 missile systems and busloads of troops had crossed the frontier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Russia did not immediately respond to the accusation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Moscow has always denied accusations in the past that its forces are fighting in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kiev's biggest worry is that rebels will continue their advance to threaten Mariupol, a highly strategic port of 500,000 people that is the biggest city still under government control in the two rebellious eastern provinces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Novoazovsk, where Kiev said Russia was reinforcing, lies 40 kilometres to the east along the coast near the Russian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The United States, which is considering tightening sanctions against Russia and arming Kiev, also said it had sighted Russian reinforcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The US State Department said Russian support for the rebels was undermining international diplomacy and would bring "costs" on Moscow.</td></tr>

<h3>Maze, Fenninger continue rivalry on World Cup circuit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The pair has 13 races left to battle it out for the season's overall title, with the Slovenian, who eyes a repeat of her 2013 triumph, enjoying a 184-point lead over the defending champion from Austria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's hard to see past Maze and Fenninger, as Americans Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin are 339 and 380 points behind in third and fourth, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Maze, who recently hinted at retirement, is the only skier this season to compete in all five disciplines, making her position atop the standings even stronger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dealing with the toughest schedule of all, Maze has complained about fatigue several times, and she seemed to have run out of energy after her outstanding opening week of the worlds when she won gold in downhill and combined, and silver in super-G.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fenninger, who hasn't raced a slalom since 2011, isn't considering starting in her weakest discipline just to boost her chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's better to be in front in your strongest events than doing a moderate slalom," Austria head coach Jurgen Kriechbaum said, adding he still believed the fight would remain undecided until the season-ending weekend in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The momentum is with Maze as she is leading and has three slaloms additionally," Kriechbaum said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"But St. Moritz has shown how quickly things can change."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In two speed races in the Swiss resort a week before the worlds, Fenninger reduced her then 331-point deficit by 147.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A year ago, the Austrian bounced back from an even bigger deficit to take the title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Returning from the Sochi Olympics, Fenninger trailed Maria Hoefl-Riesch by 208 points but led the German by 191 in the final standings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Fenninger, however, hardly believed she might be able to repeat that feat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In an interview with a regional newspaper in Austria, she deemed her chances of defending the overall title as "not realistic," adding she would rather focus on winning the discipline titles in GS and super-G.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Both Maze and Fenninger excel in GS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>From the Slovenian's 26 career wins, 14 came in that discipline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And the Austrian, an eight-time winner, took the world title in dominating style last week to add to her super-G gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The fight for the crystal globe for the season's best GS skier is still wide open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>With three races left, leader Eva-Maria Brem of Austria and Maze in fifth are separated by just 75 points, and by Fenninger, Shiffrin and Sweden's Sara Hector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Not in the hunt for the discipline title, four-time overall champion Vonn still plans her return to World Cup GS skiing Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After placing 14th at the worlds last week, the American will compete in her first World Cup event since January 2013, when she won in Maribor just 10 days before damaging her right knee in a crash at the worlds in Schladming, Austria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I need to get some good training in," Vonn was quoted on the website of one of her sponsors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Hopefully I can get my confidence back up in that event. I'm looking forward to finishing the season strong."</td></tr>
