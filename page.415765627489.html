<h3>Google's new CFO gets $70m for defecting from Morgan Stanley</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google just found out that luring a top executive from Wall Street to Silicon Valley is expensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Mountain View, California, company is paying its new chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, more than $70 million to defect from the same job at New York investment bank Morgan Stanley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The lucrative pay package disclosed in a Thursday regulatory filing underscored how much Google prized Porat, who is considered to be among Wall Street's most powerful women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Porat, Morgan Stanley's CFO since 2010, will start her new job May 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Shortly after her arrival, Google will award her stock valued at $25 million and then dole out another bundle of stock worth $40 million next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The stock awards will vest in stages through 2019.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Google Inc., the Internet's most profitable company, also is giving Porat a $5 million signing bonus to supplement her initial salary of $650,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Porat, who grew up in California and graduated from Stanford University, will be reimbursed for moving to Silicon Valley, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Morgan Stanley paid Porat a $1 million salary as part of a $10.1 million compensation package in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The bank hasn't yet revealed how much it paid Porat last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Google's current CFO, Patrick Pichette, received a $650,000 salary as part of compensation totalling $5.2 million in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pichette, who is retiring, started out with a $450,000 salary when he became Google's CFO in 2008 and received $1 million in bonuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Google gave Pichette less stock than the company is giving Porat, though the company didn't specify the value of Pichette's award at the time of his hiring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Porat is highly regarded for steering Morgan Stanley through the aftermath of the financial meltdown that triggered the Great Recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Analysts have applauded Google for landing Porat as its CFO, partly because they are hoping she will bring more financial discipline to a company that has a penchant of spending heavily on projects, such as driverless cars and medical research, that have little to with its main business of search and advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Investors also think that with Porat overseeing the company's finances, there is a better chance that Google might dip into its $64 billion cash pile to pay a dividend or buy back shares to boost its stock price.</td></tr>
