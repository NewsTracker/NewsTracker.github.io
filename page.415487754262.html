<h3>Franklin trip may have found route</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The fabled Erebus commanded by the British explorer was traced to the icy waters north of Canada last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sir John led two ships and 129 men in 1845 to chart the new route to the Indies trading nations of Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They were never seen alive by a European again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Parks Canada's Ryan Harris spearheaded efforts to find the wrecks and is planning a further dive to the Erebus next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said: "We hope to be able to identify archaeologically whether the ship was re-manned as the Inuits seem to indicate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If the ship was re-manned there is a significance to that, they must have seen a navigable route (through the Northwest Passage), this would prove it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If they were on board this ship they would have known that they had done it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The loss of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror prompted one of the largest searches in history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The expedition's disappearance became one of the great mysteries of the age of Victorian exploration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Experts believe the ships were lost when they became locked in the ice near King William Island and that the crews abandoned them in a hopeless bid to reach safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Reports at the time from local Inuits said the men, desperate for food, resorted to cannibalism before they died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 1997 the bones of crew discovered on King William Island were found to have cut marks consistent with the men having been cut up and eaten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Canadian government began searching for Franklin's ships in 2008 in a dispute over the sovereignty of an area made more viable as a trading route because of global warming increasing ice melt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Harris, senior marine archaeologist for the Canadian Government, led the party which found the Erebus last year and is returning next month, he told an audience in Banbridge, Co Down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He will spend three weeks in the inhospitable Canadian Arctic and the Canadian armed forces will support his team with giant Hercules aircraft landing on the thick ice using skis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nineteen divers will work from sunrise to sunset and Mr Harris said he hoped they would get ten days of diving out of the three week expedition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We are dovetailing our interest with the military which has sovereignty considerations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We are trying this live video feed so people could experience it in real time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The public interest in the expedition is huge."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Harris said: "Did the discipline breakdown, at what point did it occur to people to try it alone? Were there officers at the end?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The bell rang every half an hour, the changing of the ship's watches, at what point in time would they have not rang the bell, when the progress of time had no meaning, when there was little hope of returning home again?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said the Inuit reported that there were tins of unopened food on board, and analysis could shed light on whether the men were poisoned by tainted meat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The archaeologist also questioned whether there was any coal left or were they burning furniture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I tend to think it sailed in May 1845 when Franklin received his orders from the admiralty to proceed ... directing the expedition to among the worst ice choke holds on Earth, a place where even Inuit would seldom travel because there is nothing to live on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Spending two years in those conditions did not give them much of a chance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Harris's team will be establishing a camp in the ice over the site and diving through it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They will have to bore through six feet of ice, a process taking half a day, and travel down to the wreck 11 metres below the surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"There is a distinct possibility of written records on the ship, there is a very good chance that we will find the records, maybe only fragments."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>At that time pages were made of linen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He said large parts of the boat were covered in kelp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We will be looking to give the side a thorough haircut to reveal a lot of the bits that are camouflaged from view."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He said they would use a laser scanning system to give crystal-clear records of complex structures in great depth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The search party found the Erebus last September after discovering wreckage on a nearby island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Mr Harris said: "Everything was quite cloudy, you could not even tell exactly what direction the ship was."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The divers found some of the ship's timbers detached from the hulk and followed them towards the wreck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Then this enormous, stately shipwreck lying bolt upright loomed out of the haze."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He peered into the interior of the ship as part of the deck had been ripped off by ice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"You could not help feel this overwhelming sense of privilege, it is a hallowed place, where these men spent their last desperate hours suffering incredible privations and making the ultimate sacrifice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>They found a table leg which may have been from Franklin's cabin, to judge by an image contained in a newspaper article from the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>They also saw a tiller, anchors and a glass prism used to distribute light over an officer's writing desk, possibly in Franklin's bedchamber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"If the entire ship is a time capsule each cabin is distinct and offers a time capsule representing the shipboard life of an individual, their personal possessions and perhaps journals they may have kept on board," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>They also discovered the exit flue for a cabin stove where officers would have eaten, attempting to escape the biting cold and endless darkness of the polar north, as well as a mast and rigging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>A brass cannon was lying on the sea floor nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Nearly everything was covered by markers signifying it was Royal Navy property, down to the smallest pieces of equipment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Mr Harris said the ship was still in the ownership of the Royal Navy but a memorandum of understanding had been signed giving Canada custody but not establishing a precedent for other finds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The marine archaeologist said raising the ship would not be a straightforward undertaking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>It would be expensive and difficult to treat all the timbers, but it was doable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>He said: "At a time when all options are on the table and being considered, generally we would prefer to leave this wreck on the sea floor. Being a remarkable shipwreck with an incredible national and international level of interest it is a national historic site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"It has regional and local significance to the Inuit and derives a lot of significance from its historical context and that would change if it is plucked up from the sea floor, we have to see what the best answer is."</td></tr>

<h3>On HBO?s ?The Jinx,? Robert Durst Says He ?Killed Them All?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They have followed his path from New York City to Los Angeles, where one of his closest friends was found dead in her home in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They have tracked him to Galveston, Tex., where he fled after investigators reopened the case of his wife's disappearance, and where he posed as a mute woman and shot and dismembered a neighbor in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr. Durst was acquitted in the Texas killing, and was never arrested in the disappearance of his wife or the death of his friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But on Saturday, he found himself in custody once again, arrested on a charge of murder as he walked into a New Orleans hotel he had checked into under a false name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Sunday night, in the final moments of the final episode of a six-part HBO documentary about him, "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst," Mr. Durst seemed to veer toward a confession that could lift the shroud of mystery that surrounds the deaths of three people over the course of three decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"What the hell did I do?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr. Durst whispers to himself in an unguarded moment caught on a microphone he wore during filming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the years since his wife, Kathleen Durst, disappeared in 1982 after spending the weekend at the couple's country home in Westchester County, Mr. Durst has bounced in and out of jail for other crimes, cut ties with his family, remarried, and sued his brother for a $65 million share of the family fortune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Through it all, he has maintained his innocence in the disappearance of his wife, while also denying any role in the 2000 death of the Los Angeles friend, Susan Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His arrest on Saturday in a Marriott on Canal Street in New Orleans was in connection with Ms. Berman's death, though the Westchester authorities said they were still investigating him in his wife's case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr. Durst was walking toward an elevator and mumbling to himself when F.B.I. agents intercepted him at the hotel, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He had checked in under the name Everett Ward, not the first time he had used an alias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr. Durst is believed to have left Houston in a Toyota Camry on March 10, headed for New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Investigators involved in the case said they feared that the renewed attention brought by "The Jinx" would lead him to try to flee the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr. Durst will plead not guilty, said one of his lawyers, Dick DeGuerin, who helped win Mr. Durst's acquittal in Galveston in 2003 and who said he expected to head Mr. Durst's defense team in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The rumors that have been flying for years will now get tested in court," Mr. DeGuerin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As he watched the documentary Sunday night with the filmmakers, James McCormack, the brother of Kathleen Durst, said, "Closure is near at hand; I feel in my heart."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It was Mr. Durst himself who may have set the latest twist in his bizarre saga in motion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Los Angeles prosecutors reopened their investigation into Ms. Berman's execution-style murder only after Mr. Durst agreed to a series of interviews with the producers of "The Jinx," Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The amount of press coverage Mr. Durst has generated is topped only by the volume of work he has made for his lawyers and police investigators in Westchester, Los Angeles, Galveston and beyond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Yet he had rebuffed overtures from journalists until he saw "All Good Things," a lightly fictionalized film the producers had previously made of his life in 2010, and approached them to tell his story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I will be able to tell it my way," he said in the second episode of "The Jinx."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In a more recent interview, he brushed off the possibility that the documentary would whet prosecutors' appetites, saying: "It's so long ago. Some D.A. would have to commence a budget-busting investigation. I don't see that happening."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>By then, a new investigation was already encircling him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"These two producers did what law enforcement in three states could not do in 30 years," said Jeanine F. Pirro, the former Westchester County district attorney, whose office investigated Kathleen Durst's disappearance for six years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Kudos to them. They were meticulous. They were focused. They were clear."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The filmmakers spent nearly 10 years researching Mr. Durst's story: his upbringing as the eldest son of a family that controls 11 major skyscrapers in New York; his marriage to Ms. Durst, a medical student who lived in one of his family's buildings, and its unraveling; his estrangement from his family after his father chose his younger brother, Douglas Durst, to run the business in 1994.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst," Douglas Durst said in a statement on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>When prosecutors began pursuing new leads in his wife's disappearance in 2000, Mr. Durst fled to Galveston, posing as a mute woman to rent a $300-a-month room in the Gulf Coast city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The next year, he was on the run again, with a warrant out for his arrest in the murder of Morris Black, a former merchant seaman who had lived across the hall in Galveston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>After a nationwide manhunt, he was found in Bethlehem, Pa., where he had shoplifted a sandwich from a Wegmans supermarket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Mr. Durst convinced a Texas jury that Mr. Black had died accidentally when the two men were grappling over a gun that discharged as they fell to the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He testified that he had carved up Mr. Black's body until he was "swimming in blood."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But he was still under suspicion in the death of Ms. Berman, a friend from graduate school with whom he had become so close that he walked her down the aisle at her wedding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>She served as his spokeswoman after his wife's disappearance, and investigators have long suspected that she knew his secrets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The police had always known Mr. Durst was in California when Ms. Berman was killed, but could not place him in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>They suspected he was the author of a short anonymous note sent to the Beverly Hills police on the same day Ms. Berman was found shot in the head, saying there was a "cadaver" in her home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>But a handwriting analysis performed in 2003 was inconclusive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The makers of "The Jinx" obtained a letter written by Mr. Durst to Ms. Berman in which the lettering of the address on the envelope appears identical to that of the "cadaver" note, down to the misspelling of Beverly Hills as "Beverley."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In the final episode, a forensic document examiner the filmmakers asked to analyze Mr. Durst's handwriting concluded that the tics in the note's handwriting "are unique to one person and only one person."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Mr. Jarecki, who was also the show's director, and Mr. Smerling struggled with whether to bring the letter to law enforcement authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>If they did so too soon, their lawyers told them, they could be considered law enforcement agents in the event of a prosecution, possibly jeopardizing the material's admissibility in court, Mr. Jarecki said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>They also wanted to preserve a journalistic privilege not to disclose sources or testify in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Still, Mr. Smerling said in an interview, "We had a moral obligation and an obligation to the families of the dead to see that justice was done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>They began speaking to Los Angeles investigators in early 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Near the documentary's end, the filmmakers were packing up their equipment when Mr. Durst asked to use the bathroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>He did not remove his wireless microphone as he closed the door, however, and began to whisper to himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>More than two years passed after the interview before the filmmakers found the audio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Mr. Durst's private monologue makes for good television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>But it is unclear whether the recording of his comments could be used in court, some legal experts said, since they were made in a bathroom when he was alone and had an expectation of privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>"That's pretty damning stuff," said Daniel J. Castleman, the former chief of investigations in the Manhattan district attorney's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>"The question is: Is it admissible in court?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>But Daniel C. Richman, a former federal prosecutor who is a professor at Columbia University Law School, said the statements could be admitted in court "so long as it can be shown that the tape wasn't tampered with."</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>John Lewin, the lead prosecutor in the investigation into Ms. Berman's death, declined to comment on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Mr. Lewin has built a reputation for winning convictions in cold cases, some of them decades old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Now he faces an opponent who has, time and again, slipped out of law enforcement's grasp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 16, 2015, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Straight From TV to Jail: Durst Is Charged in Killing.</td></tr>
