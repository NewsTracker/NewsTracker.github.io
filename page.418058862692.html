<h3>Germany and France tell Greece to sort debt deal this weekend</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Brussels: The leaders of Germany and France have warned Greece that it must reach a debt deal with its creditors at "decisive" talks on Saturday to avert default and a possible euro exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande sang from the same hymn sheet after yet another meeting of eurozone finance ministers broke down without an agreement to free vital bailout funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Athens needs the money to cover a huge 1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) IMF debt bill that falls due on June 30, failing which its position in the single currency and even the European Union could be at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have to keep working because time is pressing and the Eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) on Saturday will have a decisive importance," Chancellor Merkel said early on Friday after an EU summit in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"All the leaders supported the idea that everything must be done to find a solution on Saturday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The French president said he would help work for a "durable" deal for Greece, whose leftist government has haggled over reform demands from its EU-IMF creditors since its election in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I consider that the meeting on Saturday is crucial ...because time is up on June 30, when the Greeks must meet their payment obligations, there are national parliaments that have to meet," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The talks between the finance ministers of the 19-country currency union had been meant to produce a deal that EU leaders could rubber stamp at their summit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But they broke down acrimoniously, with Greece and its creditors even producing rival plans for the ministers amid differences on pensions, value added tax and spending cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The EU leaders held two hours of unscheduled talks on Greece at their summit on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a sign of the passions involved, dozens of anti-austerity protesters waving Greek flags gathered at the police barricades around the summit and chanted slogans against the "Troika", as the three creditor institutions used to be known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece needs creditors to unlock the remaining 7.2 billion in its bailout to pay the IMF but the lenders have refused until Athens agrees to new reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Marathon meetings between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose anti-austerity Syriza party won elections in January, and the heads of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, ended with no deal on Thursday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Tsipras earlier insisted that a deal was still possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"After the comprehensive Greek proposals, I'm confident we'll reach a compromise that will help the eurozone and Greece to overcome the crisis," Tsipras said as he arrived at the summit.</td></tr>
