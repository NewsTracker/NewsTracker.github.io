<h3>China pledges continued support for Ebola-hit Africa nations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) - China's foreign minister has pledged continued support to the three West African countries hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 11,200 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Minister Wang Yi is in Guinea Monday for the last leg of his tour of the three countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In Liberia on Sunday, Wang said Liberia is a good example of how China supports countries in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You will see houses and roads built by China and Chinese companies helping the people of Liberia," he said through a translator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"China is ready to continue to play that role and shoulder the responsibility."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>China was one of the first to fly in badly needed medical gear when Ebola spread last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>China has provided at least $121 million in cash and supplies to fight the disease in West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It also sent dozens of army doctors and hundreds of army medical workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Liberia's Foreign Minister Augustine Ngafuan praised China's contributions "when Liberia was bed-ridden."</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>In Sierra Leone, Wang met with President Ernest Bai Koroma to discuss Sierra Leone's development and public health needs, according to a government statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He also discussed investments in mining, industrialization, fishing and construction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In Liberia, Wang criticized countries that provide assistance but then pass judgment, an apparent reaction to President Barack Obama's recent speech to the African Union which included comments on corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Whether a certain government is corrupt or not, it's not to be judged by outsiders, but only by the people," he said, adding that African leaders are elected by their people.</td></tr>
