<h3>Greece: Turkey withdraws planned military exercise in Aegean</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) " Greece says Turkey has withdrawn a recent notice seeking to reserve a large swathe of airspace over the Aegean Sea for military maneuvers until the end of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Foreign Ministry spokesman Constantinos Koutras said Monday that Turkey has withdrawn the Notice to Airmen, or NOTAM, which it had issued to reserve extensive airspace over the Aegean Sea for military use from March 2 to Dec. 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece had complained about the planned manoeuvers, which it said would have intruded into Greek airspace, interfered with traffic to two regional airports and affected two international air traffic routes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Although they are NATO allies, Greece and Turkey are traditional rivals and have been at odds for decades over territorial issues in the Aegean Sea, including over airspace and territorial waters.</td></tr>
