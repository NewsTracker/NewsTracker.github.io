<h3>Greece calls on lenders to accept "realistic" plan sent on Monday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, June 2 (Reuters) - Greece has sent creditors a "comprehensive" and "realistic" package of reforms for consideration and is calling on Europe's leaders to accept it so a long-awaited deal can be struck, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tsipras said the proposal was sent to EU and IMF lenders on Monday night, without elaborating on its contents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A Greek official said it was submitted in time for a late-night meeting in Berlin between the leaders of Germany, France, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund to discuss Greece's fate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have submitted a realistic plan for Greece to exit the crisis," Tsipras told reporters, calling on Europe to accept the plan to end "divisions in Europe".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are not waiting for them to submit a proposal, Greece is submitting a plan - it is now clear that the decision on whether they want to adjust to realism ... the decision rests with the political leadership of Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sources close to the talks said the latest proposal did not contain major new concessions on issues holding up a deal, such as pension and labour issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greece and its lenders have been locked in talks for months without an agreement and the creditors have accused Tsipras of failing to offer enough concessions - criticism he rejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We have made concessions - because a compromise demands concessions - we know these concessions will be difficult but we have submitted a realistic plan for Greece to exit the crisis," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Failure to reach agreement this month could trigger a Greek default and lead to the imposition of capital controls and a potential exit from the euro zone, dealing a blow to Europe's supposedly irreversible single currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The negotiations are tough, we are determined, we are negotiating with a plan, with a strategy, under difficult circumstances," Tsipras said.</td></tr>
