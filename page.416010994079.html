<h3>Gunman in Kenya university massacre ID'd as son of official</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Abdirahim Mohammed Abdullahi, who was killed by security forces Thursday along with the three other militants who stormed Garissa University College, was the son of a government chief in Mandera County, which borders Somalia, Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The chief had reported his son missing last year and feared he had gone to Somalia, Njoka said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Somalia's Al Shabab militant group claimed responsibility for the bloodbath, saying it was retribution for Kenya's sending of troops to Somalia to fight the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attackers separated Christian students from Muslim ones and massacred the Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The news that one of the gunmen was Kenyan highlights the challenges faced by the government in preventing terrorist attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The danger comes not only from neighboring Somalia but also from within Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kenyans make up the largest number of foreign fighters in Al Shabab, according to experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hundreds of Kenyan youths have trained with Al Shabab and then returned to Kenya, posing a major security threat, according to former police chief Mathew Iteere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kenya's government has said another source of instability is the country's refugee camps, with more than 423,000 Somali refugees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Abdullahi graduated from the University of Nairobi with a law degree in 2013 and was seen as a "brilliant upcoming lawyer," according to Njoka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Njoka said it is important for parents to inform authorities if their children disappear or seem to be embracing extremism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the security response to the Garissa attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Police waited seven hours before sending a special tactical unit into the college to fight the gunmen, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reported Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When the specially trained police finally went in, it took them only 30 minutes to kill the four attackers and stop the siege, the paper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Army barracks are just 540 yards from the college, and military officers said they could handle the attack, said a police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Only after three soldiers were killed did the army call in the police tactical unit, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Before the massacre, northeastern Kenya had seen other deadly attacks by Al Shabab against Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Several hundred grieving Christians marked Easter Sunday at a Catholic church in Garissa, where Bishop Joseph Alessandro drew a parallel between the ordeal of Jesus Christ and that of the stricken town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We join the sufferings of the relatives and the victims with the sufferings of Jesus," he told the congregation at Our Lady of Consolation Church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The victims will rise again with Christ."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>As for Al Shabab's followers, Alessandro said, "You don't know who they are. They could be your neighbors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Security forces patrolled the perimeter of the church, the site of a grenade attack by militants three years ago that wounded worshipers.</td></tr>
