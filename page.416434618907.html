<h3>Germany: 'very limited expectations' of Greece deal Friday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Germany says expectations are low that a eurozone meeting on Friday will yield an agreement with Greece that would allow the immediate release of urgently needed bailout funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Germany's finance ministry spokesman, Martin Jaeger, said Wednesday that finance ministers were heading to the meeting in the Latvian capital of Riga "with very limited expectations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said the meeting would likely yield an interim assessment but not a full deal on the reforms Greece is expected to make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Athens had agreed in February to produce a comprehensive package of reforms in order to unlock the final 7.2 billion euro installment of the international bailout that has kept the country afloat since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But little progress has been made, and Greece is perilously short of funds.</td></tr>
