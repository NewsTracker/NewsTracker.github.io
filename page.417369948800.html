<tr><td>7</td><td>ZURICH (AP) - The FIFA election is won and done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sepp Blatter's problems, however, are far from over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The prize for the 79-year-old president of soccer's governing body is four more years in office and some big issues ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>American and Swiss federal investigations, which rocked FIFA this week, could yet creep closer to Blatter's door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Blatter, who defeated Prince Ali bin al-Hussein on Friday in the FIFA presidential election, is also set for open conflict with UEFA and its president, former protege Michel Platini.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"At the end of my term I will give this FIFA to my successor in a very, very strong position, a robust position," Blatter said in his acceptance speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Q: What next for Blatter?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A: Carry on regardless, is one answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And keep fighting UEFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Blatter was defiant this week in shifting blame for the American corruption case on the actions of individuals out of his control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>His candidate speech to voters Friday simply offered more of the same leadership style.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Blatter offered no big ideas in his campaign - he did not even bother with a manifesto - but offered one pledge in his acceptance speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He put Europe on notice by promising a "better representation of the confederations" on his executive committee, where UEFA has eight of 25 voting members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Translation: Dilute UEFA's influence after it supported Prince Ali and two other election candidates from Europe who withdrew last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The FIFA vs. UEFA fight resumes Saturday morning when Blatter chairs a meeting of his 27-member executive committee.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>Q: When will Blatter finally answer questions about the election and the federal investigations?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A: FIFA has called a news conference for 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT; 5:30 a.m. EDT) on Saturday after the executive committee session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It will be Blatter's first formal meeting with international media in 15 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The FIFA president will want to talk about his election victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But he will also be quizzed on the American case which left two of his vice presidents and a newly elected member of his executive committee in Zurich prison cells during Friday's election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They are among seven soccer officials fighting extradition to the U.S. after being arrested at a luxury downtown hotel early Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The key question for Blatter?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>How and why was $10 million paid from a FIFA account as apparent bribes in the 2010 World Cup hosting contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The money ended up with Blatter's longtime executive committee colleagues Jack Warner of Trinidad and Tobago and Chuck Blazer of the United States to vote for South Africa's successful bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Q: What about the American and Swiss corruption investigations?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A: They are a rare part of the FIFA game that Blatter cannot control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A 164-page U.S. indictment detailed racketeering, money-laundering and wire fraud charges involving 14 soccer and marketing officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Four more, including Blazer, were named as having made guilty pleas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Blatter was not named in the indictment, nor were there many links directly to FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Still, U.S. federal authorities have promised it is just the beginning of their case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>More ties to FIFA could be revealed when questioning - and plea bargaining - begins of indicted officials facing 20-year prison sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>FIFA itself provoked the Swiss investigation by filing a criminal complaint to the attorney general's office about potential wrongdoing in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting contests won by Russia and Qatar, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Swiss authorities began questioning 10 FIFA voters on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Though FIFA invited the case, they may come to regret where it leads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Any serious findings will revive pressure for a World Cup re-vote - though the sporting and legal implications would be immense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Q: What do Blatter's critics inside FIFA do now?</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>A: For Prince Ali, his spell on the Blatter-chaired FIFA executive committee is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>He was maneuvered out of his FIFA vice presidency by Asian Football Confederation leaders, and then focused only on his FIFA presidential run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Over to you, Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"Enough is enough," Platini said Thursday, after asking Blatter to resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"People no longer want him anymore and I don't want him anymore either."</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The rift with Blatter won't end soon and could be widened next Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Platini has called his member federations to discuss their tactics in Berlin ahead of the Champions League final on June 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The high-stakes options are pulling out from FIFA or boycotting the 2018 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Platini does not want that, but said all options are open for his members to discuss and decide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Q: Where and when does the FIFA show go next?</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>A: First, the unfinished business on Saturday at FIFA headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Blatter and some confederation presidents, like Platini, should also soon go to two FIFA tournament finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>On June 20, FIFA protocol requires Blatter to attend the Under-20 World Cup final in Auckland, New Zealand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Then to Vancouver, Canada, for the Women's World Cup final on July 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Blatter will probably take care on that trip to avoid setting foot on U.S. territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Federal agencies would surely want to meet and speak with a visiting FIFA president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Blatter should next meet the currently hostile European soccer family in two months for what is rather a home venue for him - St. Petersburg, Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>The home city of Blatter's loyal ally, President Vladimir Putin, hosts the 2018 World Cup qualifying tournament draw on July 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Leaders of all 53 European members of FIFA should also be there for a showcase event that will put Blatter on center stage of world soccer.</td></tr>
