<h3>Ex-cyclone to cause wild weather in NT</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After two evacuations in one month, a Goulburn Island resident is calling on the Northern Territory government to invest in a cyclone shelter in the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Located 300km east of Darwin off the remote coast of the Northern Territory, there are no buildings on the island that can withstand a category 3 storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>All 427 of the island's residents were flown to Darwin for four days in February as category 4 Cyclone Lam bore down, and again for two days this week as category 2 Cyclone Nathan approached, which was forecast to intensify to a category 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Wednesday morning the residents were heading home from the emergency cyclone shelter at Darwin Showgrounds where they had spent the last two nights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I hope and pray this will be the last one," said Goulburn Island resident Bunug Galaminda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"What I'm trying to say to the government now: give us a helping hand by building a proper multi-purpose hall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Especially the old people and children being moved away, it's not good, so we need to house people and have a proper shelter for our community."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said the money spent on the two evacuations could have been put towards the construction of a shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Taxpayers' money can be used for something else, for the benefit of the community or for the benefit of the NT," Mr Galaminda said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The government has not yet released figures on the cost of the operation, but Chief Minister Adam Giles said it was planning to find a suitable location and determine what type of storm shelter was needed for the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's just a community that's never had a cyclone shelter and never had a coded building which can accommodate the 400-odd resident population," he told the ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We'd already started talking about it before Cyclone Nathan turned up, but we'll see what we can put in place."</td></tr>
