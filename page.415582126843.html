<h3>Netanyahu denies abandoning two-state solution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Holding out an olive branch to the United States, the veteran politician insisted the Palestinian Authority had to cut its ties with Hamas militants, recognize the existence of a Jewish state and engage in "genuine" peace talks with Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Taking to the US airwaves, he empathically denied going back on a long commitment to seeking a Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in comments made in the last days of the election campaign, which raised global alarm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I didn't retract any of the things I said in my speech six years ago, calling for a solution in which a demilitarized Palestinian state recognizes a Jewish state. I said that the conditions for that, today, are not achievable," Netanyahu told Fox News channel's "The Kelly File."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu accused Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas of rejecting "the acceptance of a Jewish state. He's made a pact with the Palestinian terrorist organization, Hamas, that calls for our destruction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Israeli leader also pointed to turmoil in the region unleashed in the wake of the Arab Spring, claiming that meant militants from the Islamic State group were only dozens of miles from Israel's borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Speaking with NBC television, Netanyahu insisted he was "proud to be the prime minister of all Israeli citizens, Arabs and Jews alike" after triggering outrage for warning supporters that Israeli Arabs were "turning out in droves" to the polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He suggested to NBC that he remained open to the possibility of new peace talks, saying: "I was talking about what is achievable and what is not achievable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Israel would "need the recognition of (a) Jewish state and real security in order to have a realistic two-state solution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But he insisted that to make that happen, "you have to have real negotiations with people committed to peace ... it's time we saw the pressure on the Palestinians to show that they are committed too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iran, which backs Hamas in the Gaza Strip, was ready to start pouring arms into the West Bank run by the Palestinian Authority, Netanyahu claimed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We withdrew from Gaza, we got thousands of rockets on our heads. (We) don't want it to happen again. I think the administration has said time and time again, the only way to achieve peace is a negotiated solution -- you can't impose peace," he told NBC News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If you want to get peace, you've got to get the Palestinian leadership to abandon their pact with Hamas and engage in genuine negotiations with Israel for an achievable peace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Israeli leader also maintained that his controversial anti-Arab comments on a Facebook page aimed at drumming up support at the ballot box were an attempt "to counter a foreign-funded effort to get votes that are intended to topple my party."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some outside groups had vowed to "try to get out votes for a specific party, an amalgamation of Islamists and other groups," Netanyahu said, without giving any details, insisting he was not "trying to suppress a vote."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The White House on Wednesday had chastised Netanyahu for his remarks, saying such rhetoric "seeks to marginalize Arab-Israeli citizens."</td></tr>

<h3>Secret Service chief pushes back hard against reports of crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Previous reports of a crash are inaccurate - there was no crash," Joseph Clancy said in a statement he prepared for an Thursday afternoon hearing by a Senate Appropriations subcommittee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The video shows the vehicle entering the White House complex at a speed of approximately 1 to 2 mph, and pushing aside a plastic barrel. There was no damage to the vehicle," his statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Associated Press obtained a copy of Clancy's prepared remarks in advance of the Hill hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier this month The Washington Post reported that a pair of senior agents drove a government vehicle into a White House security barrier after a night of drinking on March 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The paper also initially reported that the agents may have driven over a suspicious item suspected of being a bomb during the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The newspaper later clarified that the vehicle may have actually only driven near the item.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Earlier this week while testifying before a House Appropriations panel, Clancy said he had "seen nothing to indicate this incident as described occurred."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His prepared remarks for Thursday's hearing were far stronger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Although denying reports of a crash, Clancy was expected to reiterate his concerns that it took five days for him to learn about the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The fact that I did not learn of this allegation until five days after it is said to have occurred is unacceptable," the director said in the prepared remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clancy was set to repeat an earlier pledge to carry out appropriate discipline if a Homeland Security IG's investigation concludes the agents had been drinking before the March 4 incident - or if anyone else tried to cover up the incident.</td></tr>
