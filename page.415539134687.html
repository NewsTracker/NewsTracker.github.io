<h3>Cervantes remains found in Madrid convent, investigators believe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Archaeologists and anthropologists begin the excavation work to find the remains of Cervantes at a church in Madrid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Madrid: In a discovery that could create a new venue for literary pilgrims, Spanish investigators have declared they might have located part of the remains of Miguel de Cervantes, whose novel Don Quixote has enthralled readers over the centuries with stories of its eponymous knight and his servant, Sancho Panza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cervantes, often lauded as having written the first modern novel, died in 1616 after requesting burial in a convent in Madrid where, for almost a year, investigators have been searching the subsoil for bones that they now believe to include some of the author's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Everything coincides to lead us to believe that Cervantes is there," forensics expert Francisco Etxeberria said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Forensic anthropologist Francisco Etxeberria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The investigators cautioned, however, that it may be impossible to guarantee that the bones are those of the writer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Almudena Garcia-Rubio, an archaeologist, said there was "no confirmed genetic identification", although DNA tests were being performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The reason for the extreme deterioration of what appear to be Cervantes' remains lies in the complex history of Madrid's Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in the years following the writer's death in April 1616.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Francisco Jose Marin, a Spanish historian, said he had established beyond doubt that Cervantes, his wife Catalina de Salazar and 15 others had been buried between 1612 and 1630 in the small church of San Ildefonso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That building then became engulfed by the construction and enlargement of the convent over the next century, with the remains of the 17 transferred to the crypt of a new church within the complex at some time between 1698 and 1730.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Armed with these historical certainties, the team of 30 researchers used 3D scanners and ground-penetrating radar as they opened up a forgotten crypt under the church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As many as 240 bodies were uncovered in three burial layers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The vast majority were children from the 18th and 19th centuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Just below the third level of burials, the researchers found a collection of bone fragments lying unprotected on top of the earth next to a coffin in which a chaplain was buried in robes consistent with 17th-century Catholic style.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The tomb with the remains of several individuals, possibly including Cervantes, found in the crypt of the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Photo: J.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two coins from Felipe IV's reign (1621-1665) confirmed that these were the oldest remains in the crypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The remains believed to be those of Cervantes were found below the ground of the crypt of the church, at a depth of about 130 centimetres in a box that contained bones from 10 adults and five children, according to historian Fernando de Prato.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr de Prato said that the forensic team still faced "a lot of work", to separate the bones, perhaps try to reconstruct the bodies and perform DNA testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It would of course have been better to find his remains complete", to establish the identity of Cervantes with certainty, Mr de Prato said, "but I still have the feeling today of having reached the end of a journey."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>During the excavations, the investigators found decayed wood from a coffin with the letters M and C marked out in tacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The discovery of the coffin was announced in January, but it turned out to contain the remains of a child rather than those of the writer, Mr de Prato said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Born near Madrid in 1547, Cervantes has been described as the father of the modern novel for The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha, published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The novel gave the world the word quixotic in acknowledgment of its central character and his adventures, including his joust with windmills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The expression "tilting at windmills" also denotes people who take on imaginary adversaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>His influence on the Spanish language has been so great that it is often referred to as "the language of Cervantes".</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But such recognition as a writer came too late to bring Cervantes any fortune, after a life spent mostly as a soldier - including a five-year spell in captivity, after his naval ship was intercepted by pirates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The author had requested to be buried in the convent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Trinitarian religious order had helped to pay a ransom to release him from slavery after he was captured by Moorish pirates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The discovery of the possible remains comes as Spain and the literary world celebrate this year the 400th anniversary of the publication of the second volume of Don Quixote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Authorities in Madrid are hoping to build a monument within the church to commemorate the writer, with the goal of completing that work by April of next year, the 400th anniversary of his death.</td></tr>
