<h3>New cancer fears in France over breast implants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The national cancer institute (INCa) said there had been 18 cases of the rare disease -- anaplastic large cell lymphoma -- since 2011, linked to silicone breast implants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Given the rarity of the cases, the INCa said there was no need to recommend the removal of the implants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>France's health minister immediately sought to calm fears, with memories of faulty breast implants from the French firm PIP still fresh in the memory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We do not recommend that women carrying these implants have them removed," Marisol Touraine told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She urged women not to be "carried away by excessive worry" about the implants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Touraine said no particular brand of implant was in question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However the Parisien daily reported that 14 of the 18 cases of the rare cancer were found in women with breast implants made by US pharmaceutical company Allergan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Allergan said in a statement "the security of patients is our first priority," adding that the company was collaborating closely with the heath authorities and the drug agency ANSM.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The company added that all women aged 25 or over should have an annual health check.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The head of the INCa, Agnes Buzyn, said the increased detection rate could also be attributed to better screening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>According to Francois Hebert, deputy head of the ANSM drugs agency, around 400,000 women carry breast implants in France -- 80 percent for aesthetic reasons and 20 percent as a result of breast cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>French firm PIP sparked a global health scare in 2011, when plastic surgeons began reporting an unusual number of ruptures in their products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The PIP implants were banned and the company eventually liquidated.</td></tr>

<h3>AP clarifies: Robert Durst was not in Limp Bizkit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A reader notified media blogger Jim Romenesko of an AP report on Robert Durst being booked on weapons charges in Louisiana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The story had state trooper, Melissa Matey, telling AP that "an arrest warrant was issued for the former Limp Bizkit frontman and he was rebooked in the Orleans Parish Jail on Monday under two new charges," according to the Business Insider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In this Aug. 15, 2014 file photo, New York City real estate heir Robert Durst leaves a Houston courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Durst was arrested in New Orleans on an extradition warrant to Los Angeles on Saturday, March 14, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Robert Durst/Limp Bizkit error came to AP's attention after Romenesko asked AP to explain what was going on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>AP issued this correction: "The Associated Press reported erroneously that Robert Durst is a member of a band. He is a real estate heir; Fred Durst is the former frontman of Limp Bizkit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It could be a "there but for the grace of" type of deal, a mistake made by some overworked, poorly paid, never-to-be-heaped-with-glory reporter or editor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Paul Colford, the director of media relations at AP, told The Hollywood Reporter the original copy was sent over a broadcast-only wire and was not released directly to the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Robert Durst, the subject of "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst," has been charged with the 2000 killing of his girlfriend in Los Angeles after he appeared to confess to three killings in a private recording.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His was arrested in New Orleans on Saturday, a day before the final episode of the HBO series aired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The other Durst -- Fred -- meanwhile, is getting ready to release a tied-up studio album called "Stampede of the Disco Elephants."</td></tr>
