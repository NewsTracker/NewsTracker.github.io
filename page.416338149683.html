<h3>Veterinarian investigated for cat death shown bragging about it on Facebook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Austin County Sheriff Jack Brandes says he's disturbed by the image that shows Kristen Lindsey holding up what she described as a dead feral tomcat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"This kind of stuff shouldn't happen in our society," Brandes said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It's a very sad thing. Hopefully we will get to the bottom of it and get the truth, 100 percent truth, and get it to the DA and put it in his hands if it needs to go any further."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The operators of the Brenham clinic where Lindsey worked said Friday she was fired after they learned of the posting, which first appeared Wednesday night and has since been removed, along with her Facebook account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The posting prompted hundreds of phone calls to the Washington Animal Clinic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are absolutely appalled, shocked, upset, and disgusted by the conduct," the clinic posted on its web site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We do not allow such conduct and we condemn it in the strongest possible manner."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bruce Buenger told Bryan-College Station television station KBTX (http://bit.ly/1CWummO ), which first reported the story, his clinic's goal was to "try to fix our black eye and hope that people are reasonable and understand that those actions don't anyway portray what we're for here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>No telephone listing could be found for Lindsey Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A sign outside the clinic that lists its vets had her name covered with tape on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Texas State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners lists her as holding a valid license since June 2012 and with no disciplinary actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Houston TV station KTRK reported Lindsey planned to meet with authorities next week, accompanied by an attorney.</td></tr>
