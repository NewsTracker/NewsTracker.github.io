<h3>Thunder forward Serge Ibaka out 4-6 weeks after knee surgery (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Thunder forward Serge Ibaka could miss the rest of the season after having an arthroscopic procedure on his right knee Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Thunder general manager Sam Presti said Ibaka will be out four to six weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The playoffs begin April 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Presti said the procedure shaved off damaged cartilage from under Ibaka's kneecap that had caused discomfort and swelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ibaka started having issues in late February, but he played until missing the past three games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He had averaged 17.1 points and 9.4 rebounds since the All-Star break and was shooting 55 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The swelling caused stiffness and limited Ibaka's mobility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Presti said the Thunder tried to deal with the issue through medication, rest and a modified practice regimen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The team also removed fluid from the knee, but the problems returned and were limiting him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Presti said ideally, the surgery would have been performed in the offseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''No long-term concerns with regard to anything structural with his knee,'' Presti said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Presti said the Thunder and Ibaka agreed to have the procedure because rest and removal of fluid wouldn't stop the discomfort or the swelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The news comes while reigning NBA MVP Kevin Durant remains out with pain in his right foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Thunder were a half-game ahead of New Orleans for the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>8 spot in the Western Conference standings entering Tuesday's games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Presti said he feels confident the team can continue to play well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Enes Kanter, a new addition who plays power forward and center, is averaging 16 points and 10.4 rebounds while shooting 54 percent since he was moved from Utah at the trade deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Rookie forward Mitch McGary has been promising, and steady veteran Nick Collison is available to add minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>None of Ibaka's replacements offer his defensive presence - he has been on the league's all-defensive first team three straight years and ranks second in the league with 2.4 blocked shots per game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''We have to do some accounting for the fact that we won't have Serge going forward, but we feel really good about the team that we have, and I feel that our standard of play should continue to be where it's been, and our focus and our goals as to what guides our success remain unchanged,'' Presti said.</td></tr>

<h3>Predatory PC Darren Heath admits abusing position to have sex with THREE women</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Darren Heath, who worked as a family liaison officer for Gloucestershire Police, took advantage of his victims over an 11-year period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 'manipulative and calculating' 44-year-old also harassed a fourth women and repeatedly went to the home she shared with her partner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Heath, who also worked in restorative justice, admitted five counts of misconduct in public office between July 2002 and February 2013 at Bristol Crown Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also denied two counts of rape, one of theft and two further charges of misconduct in the public office - accessing the police database and failing to report an alleged rape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The remaining charges will lie on the court file after his not guilty pleas were accepted by the prosecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gloucestershire Constabulary's Professional Standards Department began investigating Heath following a single complaint in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But concerned officers decided to look back through their database and identified a number of other potential victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Senior Investigating Officer with the Anti-Corruption Unit, Detective Inspector Giulia Marogna, said: 'It then quickly became clear there were a number of ladies he may have offended against.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'Darren Heath would use his position as a police officer, whether it was during his time working in restorative justice or as a family liaison officer, to identify women he could offend against.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'These were often victims of crime who were already extremely vulnerable but who he wanted to take advantage of even further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'Our investigation has been lengthy because we have had to spend time regaining the confidence of women who had been badly let down by someone they should have been able to trust, precisely at a time when they needed him the most.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'Heath was manipulative and calculating while he was offending and that is one of the reasons he was able to carry on doing this over a number of years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Detective Inspector Marogna said the case will now be referred back to the Professional Standards Department to consider the action the force will next take.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She said the most disappointing thing was that Heath showed no remorse and made no comment throughout his interviews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'Those victims have shown incredible bravery by supporting this prosecution and I want to pay tribute to them for that,' the detective inspector added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She added that it was 'very satisfying' that justice had finally caught up with Heath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Heath, who appeared in court in blue jeans, green jacket and blue v-neck sweater, visibly shook as he stood in the dock for the brief hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The defendant, of Taynton, Gloucestershire, was released on bail to return to the court for sentence next week.</td></tr>
