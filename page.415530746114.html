<h3>Armed services heads say automatic budget cuts are digging too deep into America's readiness</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"We're mortgaging the future to barely meet today's needs, and that's really my concern," said Gen. Raymond Odierno, chief of staff of the Army, told the House Armed Services Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We are doing everything we can just to meet the commitments that we have today, which are not overwhelming commitments. They are just basic commitments that we have to sustain normal security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We are mortgaging our modernization. We are mortgaging our readiness," Odierno said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"So if something bigger happens, we will not be able to respond in the way people are used to us responding."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As they testified, House Republicans unveiled a $3.8 trillion budget plan for next year that effectively breaks tight budget limits on military spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The plan by Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., proposes to increase the Pentagon and State Department budget by padding an account, which is not subject to the automatic cuts known as sequestration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Budget Committee seeks more than $90 billion for that Overseas Contingency Operations account - $36 billion above the $58 billion President Barack Obama requested for fiscal 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The committee called for $534 billion for the Pentagon's core budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That's far below the $577 billion the House Armed Services Committee thought it should include.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The military chiefs said that while they want more funding any way they can get it, they expressed concern that there is not enough flexibility in the Overseas Contingency Operations account to spend the money in ways to offset recent downsizing in the services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Secretary of the Army John McHugh said sequestration must end this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>McHugh said that if it doesn't, "every installation, every component, and nearly every program will feel the brunt of these cuts."</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine parliament offers special status for rebel east, Russia criticizes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The law granting "special status" to "people's republics" proclaimed by the separatists was a follow-up to a peace agreement worked out in Belarus last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Western governments say the Minsk agreement is still the best opportunity for a lasting settlement to a conflict in which more than 6,000 people have been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Kiev's insistence that the law should come into force only when elections are held in the eastern territories under Ukrainian jurisdiction drew immediate criticism from Russia, whose forces Kiev says are arming and backing the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking in Moscow, said the law was a "sharp departure from the Minsk agreements" because it tied "special status" to elections in which the self-declared rebel leaders would not take part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Separatist leaders also criticized the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"All the questions which the Kiev parliament considered today completely contradict the Minsk agreements," a separatist official, Alexei Karyakin, was quoted as saying by the Russian news agency RIA Novosti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said Kiev planned "new bloodshed".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The pro-Western leadership bulldozed the law through parliament to show its good faith to the West - whose financial and political backing it needs to prevent Ukraine breaking up - even at the risk of shaking the consensus in the assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are adopting these laws not for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin or the occupiers. The position of Europe towards Ukraine will be defined in terms of its readiness to fulfill the Minsk agreements," Andriy Parubiy, parliament's vice-speaker and an ally of President Petro Poroshenko, told journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But other pro-Western factions, including that of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, spoke out against the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This law is a vote for de-facto recognition of the Russian occupation in Donbass," said Oleg Lyashko of the Radical Party, using a common term for describing the industrial east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The parliamentary session took place as a ceasefire, agreed at the Minsk summit of Ukrainian, Russian, German and French leaders last month, continued to hold - though tenuously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Kiev military said three Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning in clashes with rebels it accused of continuing to violate the agreement, though there has been relatively little loss of life this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The law was intended to build on the relative success of the ceasefire and other parts of the agreement, including the withdrawal by Ukrainian forces and separatists of heavy military equipment to put their big guns out of range of each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It will grant limited self-rule to separatist-minded regions for a three-year period and allow them to "strengthen and deepen" relations with neighboring Russian regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It will allow heavily armed rebels to set up their own police forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But Ukraine's insistence that elections in the eastern territories be held under Ukrainian auspices appear likely to be a stumbling block.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The law stipulates that the elections can be held anyway only once Russian forces and fighters have been withdrawn from Ukrainian territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>To balance the law, deputies hustled through a parliamentary statement that the eastern territories remained "under occupation" and would one day have to be liberated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Parliament also approved an appeal by Poroshenko to the U.N. Security Council to support the sending of a peacekeeping force to the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Apart from hopes by many in the Ukrainian establishment that supplies of Western arms may be in the offing, the Poroshenko leadership has to fall in line with Western wishes for a peaceful solution to the crisis if it is to be able to draw over the next four years on a $40 billion aid package from the West.</td></tr>
