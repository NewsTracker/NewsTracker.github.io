<h3>Gallo HR, record 4 RBIs in MLB debut, Texas 15-2 over ChiSox (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Joey Gallo walked into the Texas Rangers clubhouse after his major league debut carrying three baseballs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One was from his first hit, which came in his first at-bat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There was also the home run hit into the upper deck his next time up, and the double that ricocheted off the top of the wall in right-center field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I definitely did not think this was going to happen the first game,'' Gallo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The top prospect in the Rangers organization had those three hits, set a franchise record for an MLB debut with four RBIs, walked and even got a standing ovation after striking out with the bases loaded in the Rangers' 15-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''That easy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For real, it's that easy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>We lost one of the best players and we bring that guy from Double-A, and to perform the way he did was freaking awesome,'' said Carlos Corporan, who had a career-high five RBIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gallo made the jump from Double-A Frisco for what is supposed to be a short stint while four-time All-Star third baseman Adrian Beltre is on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained left thumb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With the bases loaded in the first, Gallo hit a hard shot that got past Gold Glove first baseman Adam LaRoche.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was scored a ''bad-hop single'' that drove home the first two runs off Jeff Samardzija (4-3).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>When Gallo came up two innings later, he hit the first pitch into the upper deck in right field - an estimated 418 feet - for a 6-2 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''This is why I get to do what I do and why I love what I do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>All the hype, incredible evening for a young man,'' Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Gallo came oh so close to another homer in the fifth with a drive off the top of the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''The Natural'' music played for home runs started briefly before being turned off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Even Gallo though he had homered again when he heard the music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He was starting to jog around first base until he saw the ball getting picked up in the outfield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Shin-Soo Choo and Corporan homered for the Rangers, who have won 11 of their last 13 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Corporan entered the game in the third for starting catcher Robinson Chirinos, who had a bruised right hand after getting hit by a pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Colby Lewis (5-3) struck out four with no walks in seven innings and the only runs he gave up were on Adam Eaton's two-run homer in the third - also in the upper deck in right but not as far as Gallo's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Samardzija allowed nine runs and 12 hits, both career highs over 233 games - 110 starts - since his major league debut in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And he was impressed by the Rangers' young slugger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''He looked pretty good to me,'' Samardzija said with a smile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''From what I saw, he definitely likes the ball in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Beltre was put on the disabled list, effective Monday, after getting hurt on a slide into second base Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Rangers announced Monday that the 21-year-old Gallo would be called up to get some major league experience with Beltre out, instead of going to Triple-A Round Rock as planned this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Gallo, chosen 39th overall as a supplemental pick in the June 2012 amateur draft, was hitting .314 with nine homers and 31 RBIs in 34 games for Double-A Frisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>After 40 homers combined in rookie ball and Low-A in 2013, Gallo set a Rangers minor league record with 42 last year between High-A Myrtle Beach and Frisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He was the first player since White Sox prospect Ron Kittle in 1981-82 with consecutive 40-homer season in the minors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>White Sox: Chicago 1B Jose Abreu was held out of the lineup for the third straight game because of a swollen right index finger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Manager Robin Ventura said Abreu could probably play, but that ''one swing could probably set him back for five more days.'' Abreu could be back in the lineup Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Rangers: Slugger Josh Hamilton was out with tightness in his left hamstring, a move he called precautionary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He got treatment Monday and Tuesday, and plans to reassess how he feels Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>... LHP Matt Harrison (spinal fusion surgery) and OF/1B Ryan Rua (right heel) start rehab assignments Wednesday with Round Rock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>White Sox: LHP Chris Sale makes his 10th start of the season for Chicago, his fifth on the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Rangers: RHP Nick Martinez is coming off his first loss, but looks to extend his club record streak of 16 consecutive starts allowing three earned runs or less.</td></tr>
