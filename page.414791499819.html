<h3>Bumpy learning curve for likely candidates in 2016 race</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>That's a good thing because so many of the candidates' feet have been sliding out from under them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The first six weeks of 2015 have featured mangled messages, snappishness, a bad hire and other flubs from the Republicans who would be president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's pretty much to be expected in the earliest stages of a campaign with just short of a gazillion potential candidates who haven't done this before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>-Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush cut loose a new hire with a history of inappropriate comments about women, gays and blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul struggled to strike the right tone on whether parents should have to vaccinate their children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker caught flak for ducking questions and picking a fight with the revered University of Wisconsin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Candidates-in-waiting got peevish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They gave underwhelming speeches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They tried to disavow their own words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And so on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Do these responses sound like guys who are ready to be president?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Do you believe in evolution, Gov. Walker?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I'm going to punt on that one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>What about the Islamic State group, Gov. Christie?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It's part of the long and brutal learning curve for a presidential race, where even seasoned politicians find the scrutiny more intense than for lesser offices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dezenhall calls this the season of "gaffe congestion" for would-be candidates and says 20 months out from Election Day 2016 is a good time to get them over with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In an earlier time, even eight years ago or 12, none of this recent drama would have been much more than a paragraph in the saga that is a presidential race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Now, thanks to Twitter and the immediacy of political commentary, mistakes are much more painful," says Ari Fleischer, a communications consultant who was President George W. Bush's press secretary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Still, he says, the best candidates will learn from their early stumbles and quickly regain their stride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Jeb Bush's team probably will check out future job applicants more carefully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A less bombastic Christie was back working in Iowa not long after snapping at reporters in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Walker turned to Twitter to at least explain, somewhat, his thinking on evolution after his refusal to answer a question on the subject during his own trip to London became a distraction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Much of what's happening right now won't be remembered a year from now or in a general election," says Stephanie Cutter, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns for Barack Obama and John Kerry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She said part of the problem may be that potential candidates don't yet have a full complement of campaign staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But she also said that some of the recent commotion, such as the vaccine flap, could signal a dynamic that will carry forward in the race as GOP candidates try to cater to primary voters without tacking so far to the right that it causes them trouble in the general election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It's also clear that even if regular voters aren't tuned in yet, the potential candidates are being sized up by donors, activists and potential staff who will be crucial to helping them run an effective campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mo Elleithee, communications director for the Democratic National Committee, predicts that some of the recent GOP missteps could turn out to be particularly telling for voters in the long run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Christie and Paul, with their bluster and argumentative interaction with the press, are "letting people see who they really are," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>For now, Democrats can largely sit back and enjoy the GOP clatter because expected candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has the experience of the 2008 Democratic primaries on her resume and is expected to face little primary opposition this time.</td></tr>

<h3>Both sides accused on Ukraine truce</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Under an agreement negotiated by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, the warring sides are to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That plan already looks at risk, with the rebels saying they are not satisfied that conditions are in place for the process to go ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Reporters in Luhanske, a government-held town nine miles north-west of the bitterly contested railway hub of Debaltseve, heard sustained shelling on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some of the artillery appeared to be outgoing, suggesting it was being fired by Ukrainian troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Debaltseve, still in government hands, remains in contention despite the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The rebels insist the town should revert to their control because they have encircled it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A loaded Grad rocket launcher was seen pointing in the direction of Debaltseve, but it was not fired while journalists were present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Observers from the Organisation from Security and Cooperation in Europe, who are supposed to monitor the ceasefire, said separatists had denied them access to Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite the ceasefire coming into effect early on Sunday morning, five Ukrainian troops were killed and 25 were wounded in the past 24 hours, Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Separatist military official Eduard Basurin said in a televised news conference on Monday that the government had lobbed artillery at Horlivka, a town under rebel control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ukraine, however, blamed that attack on the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The government-appointed police chief of the Donetsk region, Vyacheslav Abroskin, said the separatists shelled the town in order to derail the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The ceasefire appeared to hold elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The city hall of the rebel capital Donetsk, which came under heavy artillery fire in the past week, said there was no fighting in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ukraine and the west have accused Russia of arming and supplying manpower to the separatists and have imposed a range of economic sanctions to pressure Moscow into changing its course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Russia denies all suggestions it is directly involved in the war in Ukraine but the sheer amount of heavy weapons the rebels have access to belies that claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The ceasefire had raised cautious hopes for an end to the 10-month-old conflict, which has already claimed more than 5,300 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Ukraine and rebel officials have already traded multiple accusations of attacks since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Both the separatists and the Ukrainian government insist they are committed to the ceasefire negotiated in marathon talks last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But the Russian news agency Interfax quoted Mr Basurin as saying Monday that conditions are not yet ready to pull back heavy weapons on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We will begin pulling back equipment from the line of contact if we receive a certain signal, which is if the Ukrainians also do the same thing," Mr Basurin was quoted as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In Berlin, German chancellor Angela Merkel appealed for the ceasefire to be respected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The situation is fragile," she conceded, "(but) that was certainly to be expected with a view to Debaltseve."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>German foreign ministry spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli mentioned the possibility of a meeting between the German, French, Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers this week to discuss "further steps" to implement the ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>President Vladimir Putin's aide Yuri Ushakov told Russian news agencies that the ceasefire is "changing the situation dramatically" and that Moscow looks forward to the heavy weaponry being pulled out from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Meanwhile, the European Union added 19 more people and nine organisations to its list of sanctioned Russian entities, including two Russian deputy defence ministers, the eastern Ukraine-born Russian crooner Iosif Kobzon, who sang to the rebel leaders in Donetsk last year, and several separatist commanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Russian foreign ministry reacted angrily to the decision, calling it "clumsy" in the context of last week's ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The ministry dismissed the new EU sanctions as "running against common sense" and harming chances "to resolve an internal Ukrainian conflict".</td></tr>
