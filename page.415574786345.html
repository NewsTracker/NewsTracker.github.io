<h3>Messi masterclass spells bad news for Real Madrid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Barca sealed a Champions League last eight place with a 3-1 aggregate triumph following Wednesday's 1-0 win but some sloppy finishing and an inspired performance from City keeper Joe Hart kept the winning margin down to a respectable level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, the dominant performance would still have been pleasing for coach Luis Enrique, who in just a few months has silenced doubters questioning his credentials to become the leader of a side contending for silverware on three fronts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Catalan side are on a run of 17 victories from their last 18 games in which they have qualified for the King's Cup final and moved a point clear of Real Madrid in La Liga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Luis Enrique and Messi had a highly publicised bust-up in late December with the Argentine left out of the starting lineup for the first game of 2015, which they lost away to Real Sociedad, as he returned late from a winter break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Since then, Barca have only lost one game and Messi's enthusiasm has returned, with the player even training last Monday which was scheduled as a day off for the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While Messi has been the talisman, Luis Suarez and Neymar are also looking menacing in a potent three-pronged attack as Barca face a crunch clash with Real this weekend that could go a long way to deciding where the title ends up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are playing well but we cannot get carried away because there is a long way to go," Messi told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We have some big games... first against Madrid and then there are the quarter-finals (of the Champions League) where we will face another tough team."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>By contrast, arch-rivals Real have stuttered of late, recording just one win from four games in all competitions and a defeat on Sunday would intensify the pressure on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I have a lot of respect for Madrid. When Madrid are in this situation it is when they are most dangerous," Messi added.</td></tr>
