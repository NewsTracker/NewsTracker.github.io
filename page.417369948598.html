<h3>What lies ahead for FIFA and Sepp Blatter in his 5th term</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Re-elected FIFA president Sepp Blatter, right, is congratulated by FIFA vice president and UEFA president Michel Platini after his speech during the 65th FIFA Congress held at the Hallenstadion in Zurich, Switzerland, Friday, May 29, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blatter has been re-elected as FIFA president for a fifth term, chosen to lead world soccer despite separate U.S. and Swiss criminal investigations into corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 209 FIFA member federations gave the 79-year-old Blatter another four-year term on Friday after Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan conceded defeat after losing 133-73 in the first round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>ZURICH (AP) - The FIFA election is won and done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sepp Blatter's problems, however, are far from over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The prize for the 79-year-old president of soccer's governing body is four more years in office and some big issues ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>American and Swiss federal investigations, which rocked FIFA this week, could yet creep closer to Blatter's door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Blatter, who defeated Prince Ali bin al-Hussein on Friday in the FIFA presidential election, is also set for open conflict with UEFA and its president, former protege Michel Platini.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"At the end of my term I will give this FIFA to my successor in a very, very strong position, a robust position," Blatter said in his acceptance speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Q: What next for Blatter?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A: Carry on regardless, is one answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And keep fighting UEFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Blatter was defiant this week in shifting blame for the American corruption case on the actions of individuals out of his control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His candidate speech to voters Friday simply offered more of the same leadership style.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Blatter offered no big ideas in his campaign - he did not even bother with a manifesto - but offered one pledge in his acceptance speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He put Europe on notice by promising a "better representation of the confederations" on his executive committee, where UEFA has eight of 25 voting members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Translation: Dilute UEFA's influence after it supported Prince Ali and two other election candidates from Europe who withdrew last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The FIFA vs. UEFA fight resumes Saturday morning when Blatter chairs a meeting of his 27-member executive committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It must decide how to allocate qualifying slots for the 2018 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Europe's 13 places - not including host Russia - should be safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Q: When will Blatter finally answer questions about the election and the federal investigations?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A: FIFA has called a news conference for 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT; 5:30 a.m. EDT) on Saturday after the executive committee session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It will be Blatter's first formal meeting with international media in 15 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The FIFA president will want to talk about his election victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But he will also be quizzed on the American case which left two of his vice presidents and a newly elected member of his executive committee in Zurich prison cells during Friday's election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>They are among seven soccer officials fighting extradition to the U.S. after being arrested at a luxury downtown hotel early Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The key question for Blatter?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>How and why was $10 million paid from a FIFA account as apparent bribes in the 2010 World Cup hosting contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The money ended up with Blatter's longtime executive committee colleagues Jack Warner of Trinidad and Tobago and Chuck Blazer of the United States to vote for South Africa's successful bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Q: What about the American and Swiss corruption investigations?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A: They are a rare part of the FIFA game that Blatter cannot control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A 164-page U.S. indictment detailed racketeering, money-laundering and wire fraud charges involving 14 soccer and marketing officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Four more, including Blazer, were named as having made guilty pleas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Blatter was not named in the indictment, nor were there many links directly to FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Still, U.S. federal authorities have promised it is just the beginning of their case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>More ties to FIFA could be revealed when questioning - and plea bargaining - begins of indicted officials facing 20-year prison sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>FIFA itself provoked the Swiss investigation by filing a criminal complaint to the attorney general's office about potential wrongdoing in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting contests won by Russia and Qatar, respectively.</td></tr>
