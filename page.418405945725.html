<h3>After terror attacks, Tunisia erects fence on Libya border</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TUNIS, Tunisia - Tunisia's army and contractors are building a barrier along part of the country's border with Libya to keep out extremists in the wake of attacks claimed by the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Habib Essid said the goal is to render the border "impassable" by jihadist fighters and vehicles, and construction should be finished this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Essid told Tunisian TV the barrier will cover 105 miles - about one-third of the border - and will include fencing, a sand wall, trenches and surveillance posts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tunisia's government declared a state of emergency days after a gunman killed 38 tourists, mostly Britons, on June 26 in the coastal resort of Sousse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In March, two attackers fired on tourists and others at Tunis' National Bardo Museum, killing 22 people.</td></tr>
