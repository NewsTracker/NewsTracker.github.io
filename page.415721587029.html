<tr><td>4</td><td>Greig Friday was among the 150 killed when Germanwings flight 4U9525 crashed in southern France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During question time in parliament on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop read a statement from Carol and Greig's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Our family is in deep disbelief and crippled with sadness and would like to ask for privacy," the statement read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many, who they loved in return.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>His manager in the tight-knit team at Jacobs, Sarah Alper, said they were devastated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He was a lovely person, it sounds contrived, but he really was a genuinely lovely person and the workplace was better for having him a part of it," Ms Alper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"When he left to pursue an adventure, we were really sad to see him go and hoped one day he would come back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She said Greig teaching English in France was the back-up plan, but he really wanted to stay in Germany with his cousin who ran an organic vegetable farm.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>VAC peer education coordinator Budi Sudarto said they will miss Greig's witty personality and sense of humour.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>Carol was a registered nurse, midwife and maternal and child health nurse who most recently worked for the city of Casey.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>"Carol loved life. She enjoyed every minute with her family and friends."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Neighbours in Ashwood in Melbourne's south east, where Greig lived with his parents, remembered Carol and Greig as "the best people".</td></tr>
