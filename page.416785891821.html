<h3>FIFA to host Israeli and Palestinian soccer leaders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA says it will host the leaders of the Israeli and Palestinian soccer federations within days, seeking an agreement before the governing body's congress this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Palestinian Football Association wants Israel suspended from world soccer because its security forces restrict movement of players in the West Bank and Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The PFA defied FIFA President Sepp Blatter's wishes by pushing for a vote of 209 member countries on May 29 in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FIFA says Blatter met Israeli soccer leaders on Wednesday and told them "any member association that is fulfilling its statutory duties should not be suspended."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Israeli federation has said the issues are political and beyond its control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blatter has worked to mediate between the two federations since a decision at the FIFA congress in 2013.</td></tr>
