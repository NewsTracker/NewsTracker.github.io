<h3>Human Rights Watch urges Egypt to halt executions of 6 men convicted by military court</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO - A rights group is urging Egypt to halt the execution of six men condemned to death by a military tribunal for killing security forces, citing lawyers and family who contend some of them were in jail at the time of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement Saturday that the men are accused of being members of the insurgent group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The rights group says the men were part of a group of nine convicted of killing two officers in a 2014 shootout north of Cairo, and it says they should be given a retrial before a civilian court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Since the military ousted an Islamist president in 2013, courts have swiftly dealt out many harsh sentences, including life in prison and death sentences.</td></tr>
