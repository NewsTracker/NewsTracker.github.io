<h3>Islamic extremists hit Mali hotel; standoff leaves 12 dead</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Four people held in a hotel in central Mali after an attack by Islamic extremists were freed Saturday following a long standoff with the army and special forces that left 12 people dead, Mali's defense ministry adviser said.</td></tr>
