<tr><td>9</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) - After months of acrimony, Greece clinched a preliminary bailout agreement with its European creditors on Monday that will, if implemented, secure the country's place in the euro and help it avoid financial collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The terms of the deal, however, will be painful both for Greeks and their radical left-led government, which since its election in January had vowed to stand up to the creditors and reject the budget cuts they have been demanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greece needs another bailout, its third in five years, to dig itself from under a mountain of debt and to get its economy back on its feet after a six-year depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Following months of inconclusive talks, its economy is now teetering on the edge of collapse - banks have been shut for two weeks and daily business has almost ground to a halt amid cash withdrawal limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Before it can receive 85 billion euros ($95.07 billion) in loans and support for its banks to reopen, the Greek government will have to pass a raft of austerity measures that include sales tax increases and reforms to pensions and the labor market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Greece will be on a tight timetable to implement its reforms - a reflection of how little its creditors trust the government to honor a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras infuriated his European partners last month when he called for a popular vote against economic reforms the creditors has proposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Greek people voted against those proposals, but now face even tougher measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Syriza's Left Platform, a group of traditionalists in Tsipras's own party, swiftly denounced the agreement as the "worst deal possible ... that maintains the country's status: a debt colony under a German-run European Union."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Both sides in Brussels acknowledged the bitterness that marked their negotiations, which lasted nine hours past a Sunday midnight deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Trust needs to be rebuilt," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, adding that with the deal, "Greece has a chance to return to the path of growth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Stock markets rose sharply in Europe on news of a deal, as it averts the imminent danger of Greece falling out of the euro, an event that would create huge uncertainty European and global markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Stoxx 50 index was up 1.6 percent, though the euro was down 1 percent after spiking higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Experts, however, noted that Greece's problems are not over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"This agreement pulls Greece back from the brink of economic chaos but remains far from ensuring its long-term economic viability within the euro zone," says Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Greece will face many challenges in delivering on the package of reforms it has promised... The Greek economy faces a wrenching period ahead as it copes with economic, social, and political instability resulting from tough fiscal discipline, sweeping reforms, and an eviscerated social safety net."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In a first step toward getting its bailout loans, the Greek government has to pass a set of measures into law by Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>They include an increase in the sales tax and reform of the pension system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In later weeks, Greece will have to open to competition industries that have long been protected, such as the energy sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Labor laws will be made more flexible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>If it meets these requirements, Greece will get a three-year rescue program and a commitment to restructure its debt, which is unsustainably high at around 320 billion euros, or around 180 percent of annual GDP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Tsipras argues that because of these concessions Monday's deal is, despite the tough austerity, actually better for Greece than the proposals Greeks voted down just a week ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He also said he had rejected a demand by some creditors to transfer Greek assets abroad as a form of collateral and to prevent the collapse of the banking sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We managed to avoid the most extreme measures," Tsipras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Greeks seemed mainly relieved that the country was not facing a messy exit from the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Kostas Lambos, a pensioner in Athens, said things would be "difficult in the beginning" but people had to understand the severity of the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"This was a necessary step for the country to emerge from the dead ends that had been created in the last few years," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Greece's banks, which have been shut for two weeks, were still closed on Monday and limits remained on cash withdrawals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>When they will be able to reopen will depend on when the European Central Bank decides to increase emergency credit to Greek banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The ECB on Monday decided to not increase that credit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Analysts say it may be waiting for the Greek parliament to approve a first batch of reforms to secure the country's bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>French President Francois Hollande said the Greek parliament would convene within hours to adopt the reforms called for in the plan and he celebrated Greece's continued membership in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Losing Greece, he said, would have been akin to losing "the heart of our civilization."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Other European officials were less emotive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"The Greeks have to show they're credible, show that they mean it," said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers and a longtime critic of the Tsipras government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Dijsselbloem was expected to brief his fellow ministers Monday afternoon on the Greek deal, with Finland's finance minister saying the next move must come from Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>For formal bailout negotiations to start, said Alexander Stubb, "it is absolutely clear that the Greek parliament needs to approve this package."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The bill is likely to pass in parliament as it will have the backing of nearly all opposition parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>But Tsipras faces a tough battle to persuade his own radical left party that the deal was the best possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The creditors said they would help Greece in the short term with its debt repayments since a full bailout agreement was not imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Greece will need help making a 4.2 billion euro debt repayment on July 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>It is also in arrears on about 1.5 billion euros owed to the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Greece has since 2010 received two bailouts, totaling 240 billion euros ($268 billion), in return for deep spending cuts, tax increases and reforms from successive governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Although the country's budget deficit has fallen sharply, the public debt burden has increased as the economy has shrunk by a quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Menelaos Hadjicostis and John-Thor Dahlburg in Brussels, Elena Becatoros in Athens, Greece, and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this story.</td></tr>
