<h3>MH17 next of kin finally view wreckage of downed flight</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For almost all of them, it was the first chance to see the twisted and charred wreckage that lay for months in the fields of war-torn eastern Ukraine after the plane plunged to the ground July 17, most likely after being hit by a missile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>All 298 passengers and crew on board the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The wreckage was brought back to the Netherlands, where civil and criminal investigations are underway to establish the cause of the disaster and attempt to prosecute those responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Family members who viewed the wreckage at the Gilze-Rijen military air base in the southern Netherlands didn't speak to the media Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>More family members were to visit later this week, some 500 people in all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The wreckage, spread across three hangars, included wings, wheels, parts of the fuselage and overhead luggage bins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some of it was scorched black by fire, while some pieces of the plane's thin metal body were scratched, twisted and torn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Not visible to the media were parts of the plane that investigators said last year appeared 'to indicate that the aircraft was penetrated by a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Experts will soon begin piecing together parts of the plane to help investigators assess the damage and definitively establish the cause, said Sara Vernooij, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Safety Board, which is leading the civilian probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>National Prosecutor's Office spokesman Wim de Bruin said the criminal investigation is 'of an unprecedented scale' and will take at least this year to complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Silene Fredriksz-Hoogzand, whose son, Bryce, and his girlfriend, Daisy Oehlers, were on board the stricken flight, will visit the wreckage Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For some relatives, viewing the wreckage is just too hard.</td></tr>

<h3>General: 8,500 Islamic State fighters killed in Iraq so far</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The statement by Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reflected the delicate balance Washington is trying to strike between limiting Iranian influence and allowing Iraqi leaders to determine their own path to defeating the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. officials have said Iraq did not ask the U.S. to provide air support for the Tikrit offensive, even though the U.S.-led military coalition has been conducting airstrikes in much of Iraq since August and has deployed hundreds of U.S. soldiers to try to regenerate an Iraqi army that collapsed last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dempsey said Iran and its proxies have been operating inside Iraq since 2004, but the Tikrit campaign signals a new level of involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This is the most overt conduct of Iranian support, in the form of artillery and other things," Dempsey said in response to questions from members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Frankly, it will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said that about two-thirds of the force seeking to retake Tikrit is comprised of Iranian-based Shiite militia fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Iraqi government troops make up the other third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tikrit, the hometown of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, is a predominantly Sunni city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If they perform in a credible way" and rid Tikrit of Islamic State control, "then it will, in the main, have been a positive thing in terms of the counter-ISIL campaign," Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. general overseeing the military coalition fighting in Iraq told a House panel that the campaign has killed more than 8,500 Islamic State fighters since its bombing campaign began in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, the commander of U.S. Central Command, said the Islamic State, which has controlled key parts of northern and western Iraq since last summer, is no longer capable of seizing and holding new territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Austin said that in addition to killing at least 8,500 Islamic State fighters, the U.S.-led bombing has destroyed "hundreds" of the group's vehicles, tanks and heavy weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The bombing also has degraded the group's ability to generate revenue by striking oil refineries and crude oil collection sites, particularly in neighboring Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The fact is that he can no longer do what he did at the outset, which is to seize and to hold new territory," Austin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Austin made the remarks in his prepared statement at a hearing on President Barack Obama's request for new legal authority to execute the military campaign against the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Austin is a former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The general was speaking amid new uncertainty about the direction of the battle against the Islamic State as Iraqi forces, including Iranian-supported Shiite militias, opened a counteroffensive against the Islamic State in the city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Asked about Iran's military participation in the battle for Tikrit, which began on Monday, Austin did not describe the nature or extent of Iranian involvement but stated flatly, "There is no cooperation between U.S. and Iranian forces."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The general said U.S. intelligence sources allowed him to foresee Iran's involvement in the Tikrit fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The activity in Tikrit was no surprise," Austin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I saw this coming many days leading up to this. It's a logical progression of what they have been doing in the east of the country, but we don't coordinate with them," he added, referring to the Iranians.</td></tr>
