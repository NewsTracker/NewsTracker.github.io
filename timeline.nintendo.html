<li>It was the stock's biggest daily gain since Nintendo became public in 1983, adding some $4 billion to the company's market capitalization.</li>
<li>Nintendo, however, may be shifting away from hardware, with Iwata saying it was developing a new gaming platform, the NX, as well as an online membership service to be launched this year.</li>
<li>"Nintendo is not in a position to simply drop its legacy console businesses given the investments made in software," said CLSA analyst Jay Defibaugh.</li>
<li>Before the tie-up with DeNA, Nintendo's shares had fallen over 30 percent in the past four years, lagging a more than doubling in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index.</li>

<li>Nintendo, which already warned its annual operating profit would halve on weak console sales, said on Tuesday it was teaming up with online gaming firm DeNA Co Ltd to develop and operate gaming apps.</li>
<li>Although Iwata didn't disclose any details about Nintendo's first mobile game, he said it would not be a hand-me-down from the company's famed console titles.</li>
<li>For DeNA, which grew from a startup launched in 1999 to a major online gaming company, a tie-up with Nintendo will help it regain momentum lost in the past two years as users moved on to more popular gaming apps.</li>
