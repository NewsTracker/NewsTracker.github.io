<tr><td>153</td><td>But it was hard to find any opposition Wednesday after she softened her tone and asked the U.S. Justice Department to launch a broad civil rights investigation that could eventually force the city to make changes under the oversight of an outside monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>154</td><td>The Democratic mayor now says she'll accept outside intervention to rebuild public trust in a city torn by riots over the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered a fatal spinal injury in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>155</td><td>"I am determined not to allow a small handful of bad actors to tarnish the reputation of the overwhelming majority of police officers who are acting with honor and distinction," she wrote in a letter to the new U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>The mayor's announcement came the day after her closed-door meeting at City Hall with Lynch, who pledged to improve the police department and told faith and community leaders that "we're here to hold your hands and provide support."</td></tr>

<tr><td>158</td><td>The city's police union and City Council president also welcomed the development.</td></tr>

<tr><td>165</td><td>More than 200 people were arrested as cars and businesses burned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>166</td><td>Baltimore has already been participating in a voluntary Justice Department review, requested by Rawlings-Blake and Batts last fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>167</td><td>It would enable police to implement reforms without a court order or independent monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>168</td><td>But City Council President Jack Young said he's been warning since October that police won't change unless they're forced to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>169</td><td>"The police commissioner could have said, 'Well, now, I don't want to do that,' and he didn't have to do it," Young said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>170</td><td>"In my opinion, it was a toothless tiger."</td></tr>
<tr><td>171</td><td>The Justice Department also is investigating whether Gray's civil rights were violated, a much narrower review than what Rawlings-Blake sought Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>172</td><td>Meanwhile, six officers face state charges ranging from assault to second-degree murder in Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>173</td><td>At least two of them have filed motions challenging the prosecutor's assertion that Gray was arrested illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>174</td><td>The investigation the mayor now wants is a wide-ranging civil-rights probe, examining how police use force, and search and arrest suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>175</td><td>A similar investigation followed the shooting of an unarmed, 18-year-old black man by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.</td></tr>
