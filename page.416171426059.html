<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Video: Islamic State destroys ancient ruins of Nimrud BAGHDAD (AP) - An online video purports to show Islamic State militants bombing ruins at the ancient Iraqi city of Nimrud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The video, posted late Saturday, showed militants using sledgehammers, jackhammers, a bulldozer and ultimately explosives to level the site, located near the militant-held city of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some of the figures in the video appeared to have rebar, ribbed bars of steels designed to reinforce concrete that are a technique of modern building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An Iraqi Antiquities Ministry official, speaking Sunday on condition of anonymity, said all the items at Nimrud were authentic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In March, both Iraqi and United Nations officials warned the site had been looted and damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The video conformed to other Associated Press reporting about the militants' attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One militant on the video said: "God has honored us to remove all of these idols and statutes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Islamic State group, which holds a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate, has been destroying ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Authorities also believe they've sold others on the black market to fund their atrocities.</td></tr>
