<h3>Eurozone's stretch of falling consumer prices ends in April</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The drop in consumer prices in the eurozone has come to an end after four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, said Thursday that consumer prices were unchanged in the year through April, up from the 0.1 per cent fall recorded the previous month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The flat reading was in line with market forecasts and reinforces expectations that the impact of lower oil prices is moderating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In the year to April, energy costs were 5.8 per cent lower, against the 9.3 per cent fall recorded in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Energy costs were the main reason why consumer prices in the eurozone fell between December and March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fears that a long-lasting period of falling prices could weigh on the eurozone economy were largely behind the European Central Bank's recently launched 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) monetary stimulus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At first glance, a drop in prices sounds nice -- particularly for consumers getting goods for cheaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And that appears to have happened over the past few months as consumers gained in their pocket from the fall in oil prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Money saved filling up a car was money that could be used elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Most economic figures over the past few months have shown an uptick in eurozone economic activity, though concerns over Greece appear to be having an effect again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The problem confronting ECB policymakers was not about the short-term fall in prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Its concern centred on the possibility that prices might fall consistently over time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Such a longer-term, called deflation, encourages people to put off spending and can prove difficult to reverse because it requires altering people's expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It can lead to years of economic stagnation, as in Japan over the past two decades, or at worst, into something more pernicious, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Though deflationary pressures appear to have eased somewhat, the ECB still has a long way to go before inflation is where it wants to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Its aim is to have prices rising at a tad below 2 per cent annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The core rate, which strips out volatile items such as food, tobacco and energy, is also low at 0.6 per cent, suggesting that pricing pressures in the economy remain subdued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As a result, most economists think the ECB is likely to keep its stimulus for a while yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>ECB President Mario Draghi has given few indications that its scheduled Sept 2016 end-date is flexible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Having flirted with the dreaded spectre of deflation all year, today's figures are encouraging news for Draghi," said Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Elsewhere, Eurostat also said unemployment across the eurozone was unchanged in March at 11.3 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The reading masked the fact that the number of jobless fell by 36,000 to 18.1 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Over recent months, unemployment has been falling as the economy has grown stronger, particularly in Spain, which has seen some of the highest unemployment rates in the region for years.</td></tr>
