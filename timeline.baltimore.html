<li>FILE - This May 1, 2015, file photo provided by the Baltimore Police Department shows Lt. Brian Rice, one of the police officers charged with felonies in the death of Freddie Gray.</li>
<li>The psychological firm paid to evaluate Baltimore police, including Rice, Psychology Consultants Associated, has been reprimanded by the state police for cutting corners in its mental health screenings of officers.</li>
<li>Baltimore's law department and inspector general are also investigating the firm's assessments of city police officers, said Kevin Harris, a spokesman for the city.</li>
<li>As part of his contract with the Baltimore City Police Department, Sachs assessed the mental health and fitness for duty of officers who were removed from active duty due to psychological problems.</li>
<li>Michael A. Wood, a retired Baltimore police sergeant who said he wrote the department's medical policy, said Rice "absolutely would have had a fitness for duty evaluation, and would have been referred to PCA. It would have been required."</li>

<li>BALTIMORE - Less than three years ago, Anthony Batts was hand-picked by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to combat crime and reform a troubled law enforcement department in one of America's most violent cities.</li>
<li>Batts and Rawlings-Blake are African-American, as is the city's top prosecutor, Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby.</li>
<li>Baltimore's homicide total this year is 156, according to police.</li>
<li>The startling spike stands in stark contrast to Batts' promise to fight violent crime when he arrived in Baltimore in 2012.</li>
<li>Batts took over from Fred Bealefeld, who resigned after five years as commissioner and 31 in the Baltimore Police Department.</li>
<li>Batts too was a veteran officer, though new to the city of Baltimore: He spent three decades in California, two as commissioner of the embattled Oakland Police Department and seven as commissioner of the Long Beach police department, where he'd served as a law enforcement officer for 20 years.</li>
<li>"I worked closely with Commissioner Batts and always found him open to my ideas for reforming the department," said Baltimore City Council President Bernard C. "Jack" Young.</li>
