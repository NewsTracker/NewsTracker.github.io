<li>BALTIMORE - Less than three years ago, Anthony Batts was hand-picked by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to combat crime and reform a troubled law enforcement department in one of America's most violent cities.</li>
<li>Batts took over from Fred Bealefeld, who resigned after five years as commissioner and 31 in the Baltimore Police Department.</li>
<li>Batts too was a veteran officer, though new to the city of Baltimore: He spent three decades in California, two as commissioner of the embattled Oakland Police Department and seven as commissioner of the Long Beach police department, where he'd served as a law enforcement officer for 20 years.</li>
<li>"I worked closely with Commissioner Batts and always found him open to my ideas for reforming the department," said Baltimore City Council President Bernard C. "Jack" Young.</li>
