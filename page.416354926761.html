<h3>Egypt court sentences 11 to death over 2012 football riot</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An appeals court had ordered the retrial of 73 defendants in February last year after rejecting a lower court verdict sentencing 21 people to death for being involved in the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The riot erupted in February 2012 when fans of home team Al-Masry and Cairo's Al-Ahly clashed after a premier league match between the two clubs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sunday's death sentences against 11 football fans have been referred to Egypt's grand mufti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The court will make a final decision on their fates, as well as those of the other defendants, on May 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 73 defendants include nine police officers and three officials from Al-Masry club, while the rest were fans of Al-Masry club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Two of those sentenced to death are on the run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>None of the families of the victims or of the defendants attended Sunday's court session, which was held in Cairo for security reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sunday's verdict can be appealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The 2012 clashes in the Port Said stadium sparked days of violent protests in Cairo, in which another 16 people were killed in fighting with security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A year later, dozens of people also died in the canal city during clashes that erupted after the lower court handed down the 21 death sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Port Said riots were the deadliest sport-related riots in Egypt, where football fans regularly clash against rival supporters or with security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The authorities reacted by imposing a ban on fans attending premier league matches and held the games behind closed doors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But on February 8, at least 19 people died in a stampede after police fired tear gas at fans trying to force their way into a Cairo stadium for a premier league match that was open to the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Television footage showed crowds squeezed inside a narrow metal enclosure, jostling to enter the stadium when the stampede erupted as police fired tear gas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The police reject the accusations and blame the unrest on Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sixteen suspects accused of clashing with police on that day have been arrested and referred to trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Egypt's hard-core football fans, the "ultras", have often clashed with police, including in political unrest that has seen two presidents toppled since 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The "ultras" were at the forefront of protests against long-time autocrat Hosni Mubarak, who stepped down in early 2011 after an 18-day uprising against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That uprising was essentially against the police, who were regularly accused of torturing detainees and of being involved in extra-judicial executions.</td></tr>
