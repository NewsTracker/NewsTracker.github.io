<h3>Former Mossad chief rejects parts of Netanyahu's Iran speech to Congress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In an interview aired on Channel 2 TV, Meir Dagan questioned Netanyahu's claim that the deal under negotiation with world powers would allow Iran to create a nuclear weapon within a year or less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The time is longer than what he describes," Dagan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dagan also rejected Netanyahu's assertion that Iran's intercontinental ballistic missile program could allow it to deliver a nuclear arsenal to "every part of the United States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The missiles cannot reach the U.S.," Dagan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When asked if Netanyahu does not know that, Dagan replied: "He knows. So what?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Channel 2 showed Dagan making the comments as he watched Netanyahu's televised speech to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>When Netanyahu said that "the Jewish people can defend ourselves," Dagan said: "That is a threat of attack."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, of Netanyahu's Likud Party, told Channel 2 that he rejected many of Dagan's assertions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dagan has been a fierce critic of Netanyahu's approach to Iran, emerging as a key opponent of a potential Israeli military attack against its nuclear facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He has said Netanyahu's trip to Washington, over White House objections, was pointless and counterproductive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dagan directed the Mossad from 2002 to 2010, a period when it reportedly carried out covert attacks against Iranian nuclear scientists and unleashed cyberattacks that delayed Iran's progression toward a bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Last week, Dagan told an Israeli daily that "the person who has caused the greatest strategic damage to Israel on the Iranian issue is the prime minister."</td></tr>
