<h3>Apple's $62B hit is badâ€¦but it's not the worst</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple's quarterly earnings left some investors with more questions than answers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Here are 3 things to know about the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wall Street was left unimpressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Despite beating earnings estimates on Tuesday evening, Apple's stock has sunk in after-hours trading and is on course to write a new page in the history books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The stock dipped to around $120 a share immediately after Tuesday's report with fears over the demand for its high-end smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The reaction was the worst seen since its January 2014 earnings release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It also briefly fell below its 200-day moving average Tuesday and Apple hasn't closed below this metric since Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>17, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At its lowest point on Tuesday evening, it effectively wiped $62 billion off its market capitalization, which stood at $753 billion at the close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This size drop is similar to the entire market capitalization of Priceline Group or German automaker BMW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In January 2013, Apple lost a remarkable $59 billion in market cap, meaning Tuesday's after-hours fall set an unwarranted milestone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The stock was trading at around $124.25 early on Wednesday, having pared some losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However, experts have been delving into the archive and it appears there's some signs that Apple could take comfort from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>File photo of Apple stock seen on a TV at the NYSE in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The drag it could have on the S&P 500 Wednesday is currently not near a record, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He explained that Microsoft lost $82.2 billion on April 3, 2000, after news that a federal judge ruled it violated antitrust laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Let's hope Apple comes nowhere near that level (which would be a $14.27 decline, with an index impact of 9.31 points)," he said in a note late Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Traders cited a disappointing fourth-quarter forecast for the iPhone maker as the reason behind the fall, alongside it missing targets for the amount of handsets it sold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Michael Yoshikami, founder & CEO at Destination Wealth Management, told CNBC Wednesday he believed the earnings report for Apple wasn't as bad as the stock plunge implied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He added that he saw "opportunities" at its current price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>BMO Capital Markets has even raised its earnings-per-share outlook on the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Apple delivered a very good quarter against high expectations," it said in a note on Wednesday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Correction: An earlier version misstated when Apple's stock fell below its 200-day moving average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It was Tuesday.</td></tr>
