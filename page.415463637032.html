<h3>U.S. writing teacher wins $1M 'Nobel Prize of Teaching'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An American writing teacher whose private demonstration school in Maine has attracted thousands of teachers over the past 25 years has won a $1 million award dubbed "the Nobel Prize for Teaching."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nancie Atwell, who began teaching in 1973, is the author of nine books on writing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She learned of her award Sunday at a ceremony held by the Varkey Foundation in Dubai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The foundation's mission is to improve the standards of education worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Its Global Teacher Prize carries with it a commitment to teach for at least five more years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Atwell said she'll spend the $1 million on keeping the Edgecomb, Maine, school running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's like a miracle," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It'll mean life for my school for another decade."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Asked how she'll use the money, she said without hesitation: "I can buy two new furnaces - the boilers are shot - and books!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She noted that the school is 25 years old, "and that's the life of a boiler. I've been patching them together with duct tape and chewing gum. We're going to have consistent heat next winter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Three U.S. teachers who were among the 10 finalists for the $1 million Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Atwell, 63, also said she'd use the money for tuition assistance at the private school, which has served as a training ground for teachers from far beyond Maine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It guarantees the future for so many children," she said, "and it continues our impact as a school on other teachers and their children."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Education Secretary Arne Duncan tweeted congratulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Atwell was competing with a handful of teachers from around the world, including two other Americans: Naomi Volain, 56, a high school science teacher in Springfield, Mass., whose hands-on lessons in environmental science and outdoor education have won praise and awards; and Stephen Ritz, 52, an elementary school teacher in New York City's South Bronx, who has pioneered a low-cost, portable gardening and nutrition program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>One of the judges, Jordan Shapiro of Temple University, said Atwell's teaching "transcends buzzwords and trends, it is very thoughtfully grounded, prioritizing the work learners need to do in order to become autonomous critical thinkers. What's even more impressive is that she's created an institution and framework through which to share it with other teachers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Atwell, who grew up in western New York and began her teaching career there, moved to Maine in 1975.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In 1990, she founded the Center for Teaching and Learning, an independent demonstration school to experiment with teaching methods for students in kindergarten through eighth grade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Her name has become synonymous with a technique for teaching language arts known as "writing workshop," an intensive method that focuses on stories and self-expression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I was an English major," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I loved literature. I cherished great books, but my kids weren't reading enough. Not nearly enough."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She began gradually letting go of assigned texts and started building "an excellent classroom library" of books, fiction and non-fiction, that appealed to students even if they didn't appeal to adults.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Her methods became popular just as schools in the U.S. were moving toward more standardized, test-driven methods of instruction - a trend she sees gaining steam in schools' haste to adopt standards called Common Core, new benchmarks in language arts and math.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I worry that educational bureaucrats have a problem with pleasure," she said, "that if kids are enjoying what they're doing, it can't be rigorous or worthwhile."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Nancie Atwell, a teacher from Southport, Maine, U.S., left, is greeted by one of her competitors after she wins the $1 million Global Teacher Prize in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Sunday, March 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Reached in Dubai minutes after winning, Atwell said she was "in a daze. I'm really having almost an impossible time taking it in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Her first reaction, she said, was to ask herself, "'Did he just say my name?' I wasn't sure what he said. It was almost an aural hallucination."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Atwell said the other finalists, including the international nominees, are all "fantastic teachers and people. All of them are people who work to engage kids, make school life enjoyable and ease the way and invite kids into the best possible version of reality. Obedience isn't the goal. Compliance isn't the goal with any of them. It's engagement. So it was powerful to be in their company this weekend."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She said the prize stands in contradiction to the more test- and skill-driven approach to education prevalent in many U.S. schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>She called herself "one of the old progressive teachers who's still believing in the power of children's voices and choices and teacher autonomy," adding, "I think the pendulum has to swing back. It can't swing any further to the right."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Nancie Atwell, a teacher from Southport, Maine, U.S., 1st left, and the rest of the competitors appear on the stage for the final announcement of the $1 million Global Teacher Prize in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Sunday, March 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In her acceptance speech, Atwell quoted the 20th-century English poet John Masefield, who wrote, "The days that make us happy make us wise."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I think that's the kind of thread that's running through all of our teaching," Atwell said of the nominees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"When children are engaged, when learning is joyful, those are the lessons that stick. Those are the lessons that are worthwhile and meaningful and hang around."</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt sacks 41 judges for 'supporting' Brotherhood</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Disciplinary Council headed by Nabil Zaki, a judge, did not immediately release the reason for its decision on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The government has implemented a harsh crackdown on Islamists and secular political opponents since July 2013, when then-army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi following mass protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Reuters news agency reported that 31 of the judges were sent into compulsory retirement for signing a statement condemning Morsi's removal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Another 10 were removed from their posts for joining the "Judges for Egypt" group, which supported the Brotherhood even before Morsi's removal, Reuters reported, citing judicial sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egyptian law prohibits judges from engaging in politics, but critics and human rights groups say the judicial disciplinary court has turned a blind eye to judges who openly support the government of Sisi, who was elected president last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The government says the judiciary is independent and it never intervenes in its work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The decision is shocking and it is a massacre of the judges," Ahmed El-Khatib, one of the punished judges, told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He made no comment about whether he supported the Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The judges have the right to appeal the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Separately, security forces arrested 63 middle-level Brotherhood leaders who face charges of attacking police headquarters and inciting violence, Egypt's interior ministry said in a statement on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Another 13 Brotherhood supporters were arrested on suspicion of possessing arms and ammunition, it added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The government blacklisted the Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation in December 2013, and Sisi says it is a threat to national security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The group says it is committed to peaceful activism.</td></tr>
