<h3>TUI Group's earnings hit by Greece & Tunisia fears</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thomson and Falcon Holidays owner TUI has revealed that the terrorist massacre in Tunisia and the Greek debt crisis would have a 20 million impact on earnings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tourists were flown home from the North African country and travel operators have cancelled holidays there, with the British Foreign Office and other governments still advising against visits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The costs of the flights home plus cancellations and switching people booked on holidays to Tunisia to different destinations resulted in an impact of around 20 million on TUI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It set out details in a trading update for the third quarter to the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>TUI's joint chief executives Friedrich Joussen and Peter Long said: "This quarter was marked by the tragic events in Tunisia at the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Supporting our customers, their families and our colleagues through this sad time remains our highest priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are very proud of the commitment and dedication our colleagues have shown throughout this unprecedented situation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>TUI also said that bookings to Greece in late June and the first half of July were hit by economic uncertainty - as the indebted country neared economic collapse before reaching a deal on a new bailout with creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The company did not give an update on the future impact of the Tunisian atrocity - in a country which has in the past represented 3% of its annual tour operator programmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The figures come after rival Thomas Cook revealed a 25 million hit to earnings from events in Tunisia and Greece.</td></tr>
