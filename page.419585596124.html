<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) " A nearly 2,000-year-old temple in the Syrian city of Palmyra this week was the latest victim in the Islamic State group's campaign of destruction of historic sites across the territory it controls in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The group has destroyed ancient buildings and artifacts, as well as shrines to Shiite and Sunni Muslim saints " looting some sites for profit " all in the name of purging what it considers symbols of idolatry to create a society dedicated solely to its extreme and violent interpretation of Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The IS campaign has horrified many around the world with a scope of destruction that hasn't been seen for decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Still, it isn't unprecedented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Throughout the centuries, invaders, religious fanatics and colonizers have targeted works of art, houses of worship and other pieces of heritage.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Allied with the powerful Saud family, Abdul-Wahhab's followers destroyed anything they saw as promoting idolatry or polytheism, including shrines of Shiite and Sufi saints, and the destruction of a major Shiite shrine at Karbala in what is now Iraq.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Mobs of Protestants attacked hundreds of Catholic churches, particularly in France, Germany and the Netherlands, destroying statues and images " and in England under King Henry VIII, churches were stripped of their relics and riches. The result erased from Europe's cultural landscape untold numbers of works of art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>During the Muslim invasion of Spain in the 8th century, churches were often destroyed or turned into mosques.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Conversely, when Christians took back the peninsula in the centuries-long Reconquista, completed in the 15th century, they destroyed mosques or turned them into churches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Also, after King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella ordered the expulsion of Jews from the peninsula in 1492, synagogues were turned into churches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Roman armies destroyed the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D. after a revolt against Roman rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The temple, built 500 years earlier to replace the first temple destroyed by the Babylonians, was the heart of Judaism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The first temple had held the Ark of the Covenant, which vanished after the Babylonian conquest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>All that remains of the second temple is its Western Wall, which is today the holiest site in Judaism, located at the base of Jerusalem's Temple Mount.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes conquered the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, in 1521, bringing to an end the empire that ruled over much of what is now Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To root out the local religion, Cortes ordered temples destroyed, including the Templo Mayor, the giant step pyramid at the center of Aztec spiritual culture " and site of their human sacrifices.
