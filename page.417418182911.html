<tr><td>2</td><td>Riyadh is a key backer of Islamist rebels battling to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Egypt's government, which is deeply suspicious of Islamist movements throughout the region, says Assad's government will have to be part of a negotiated settlement.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, who is visiting Cairo for the first time since assuming his post, denied any reports of tension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"There is no disagreement," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"In Syria, we are all seeking to remove Bashar Assad from power after he lost his legitimacy, and we are all seeking to restore peace and stability in Syria.
