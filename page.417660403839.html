<h3>Review: The best new features coming from Apple, Google</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - New features promised for smartphones, tablets and watches could improve how we interact with technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Although it's too soon to tell how well these will work in practice, here's a look at what I'm looking forward to most this fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>I like to do other things, such as checking email or Facebook, when I'm watching video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Laptops let me do this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>With iPads, video stops as soon as I open another app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I need to pick up a second device to multitask.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With the upcoming iOS 9 update, you can slide a window from the right of an iPad to launch a second app, such as a map when you're doing email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Best of all, you can have video running in a small window in the foreground while you do other things with an app that takes up the rest of the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>You can even move the video off screen and still listen to its audio while you work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Samsung has tried this with some Android phones and tablets, with mixed success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Video sometimes stops anyway when you try to run it on the side, as apps weren't designed with this in mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>With Apple, it will be a core feature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple Maps has improved a lot for driving and walking directions since it ousted Google Maps in 2012 as the default service on iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Transit directions are coming with iOS 9, though only in select cities at first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In the U.S., that will be Baltimore, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It's not everywhere, but it's a good start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Android, Google Maps will get offline navigation, matching what Windows phones offer with Here Maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>You'll get turn-by-turn directions and details on local businesses even when cellular service is sketchy or nonexistent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>You'll have to download a specific region of the map ahead of time, and it's not yet clear how easy or how wide of a region that will be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It's also not yet known whether this feature will extend to Google Maps on iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Siri on Apple devices and Google Now on Android devices are supposed to get smarter by doing more based on context.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Calling on Google's assistant while listening to a song might give you information on the artist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Doing so while reading an email on movie plans might get you reviews and trailers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Siri, meanwhile, should know whether you're going on a run or getting in a car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>You might automatically get music on a run, but an audiobook in your car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Siri also promises to anticipate your needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>If you have a meeting coming up, she'll remind you to leave, factoring in current traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Google Now has been doing that for years, with mixed results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>I get reminders to leave for the airport followed by directions back home, for instance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I look forward to seeing how well Siri and Google Now perform with the upcoming smarts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Android users will get more control over what permissions they give apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Currently, you're shown a long list of permissions when installing new apps, such as letting the app access your location or the phone's microphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>You have to accept all of them or forgo the app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>With the upcoming M version of Android, you give permission as apps need it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>That's how it works on iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>So if an app needs access to your camera, you decide then whether to grant permission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>If you decline, you can still use the app's other features.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>On Apple Watch, apps from outside parties have essentially been extensions of phone apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>All the computing is done on the phone, with bits of information transferred to the watch's screen wirelessly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>That will change with the upcoming watchOS 2 system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>For the first time, third-party apps will be able to directly interact with sensors and controls on the watch, something Apple apps can already do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>That makes it possible for outside parties to write games, fitness and other apps that work without the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Apple Watch will also be able to play video for the first time - if you don't mind the small screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Phones running Microsoft's system have a lot of innovations, including direct links from the home screen to specific tasks within apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Windows phones suffer from a lack of apps, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>New tools will make it easier for app developers to convert their existing iOS and Android apps to the upcoming Windows 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Windows phones could become a viable alternative - if developers see a reason to bother.</td></tr>
