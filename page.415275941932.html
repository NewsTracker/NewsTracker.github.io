<h3>Brazil's Petrobas graft probe exapanded</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The inquiry will now focus on a former president, the leaders of the lower house and Senate and 51 other figures as federal prosecutors dig into political ties to the scheme that they say saw at least $800m in bribes and other funds paid by big construction and engineering firms in return for inflated contracts with the state energy company Petrobras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The investigation and any possible trials will take years to play out, but the action throws the second term of President Dilma Rousseff into further disarray as she faces dueling political and economic crises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She is not being investigated, although she was chairwoman of the Petrobras board for several years as the kickback scheme played out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Experts say the investigations could create further gridlock in Congress just as Brazil and its sputtering economy desperately need fiscal and political reform measures passed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the investigation is widely viewed as a necessary evil for the nation's democracy to advance and shake off deep-rooted impunity for the rich and powerful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You can't put this genie back in the bottle. People are going to have to face the consequences," said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"There used to be the idea that people in positions of power in Brazil were untouchable. They're no longer untouchable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>During the first phase of the inquiry, investigators struck plea bargain deals with several "operators" who said they helped move the money around in the deals, along with former top Petrobras executives who admitted raking in hundreds of millions in bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That testimony paved the way for the opening of investigations into politicians who allegedly benefited from kickbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Under Brazilian law, the Supreme Court has to approve any investigation of lawmakers or top officials in the executive branch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Any criminal charges or trials of such figures must also must be approved and judged by the top court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Among those the court said would now be investigated are former president and current senator Fernando Collor, who was forced from the presidency by a corruption scandal in 1992 before making a political comeback in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Also to be investigated are Senate leader Renan Calheiros and Eduardo Cunha, who heads the lower house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Both are members of the powerful Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, part of the governing coalition led by the Workers' Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Both have already shown they are ready to create serious gridlock in Congress because of the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Also on the investigation list are Rousseff's former chief of staff and current senator, Gleisi Hoffman; Rousseff's former Energy Minister Edison Lobao; and Antonio Palocci, who was finance minister under the previous president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and was Rousseff's first chief of staff.</td></tr>

<h3>Top US general optimistic about outcome of Tikrit battle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iranian-backed Shiite militias and Sunni tribes have joined Iraq's military in a major operation to retake Tikrit from the Islamic State group, while the U.S. led coalition has remained on the sidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ABOARD A U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT (AP) - The one-two punch of Iranian-back militias and Iraqi government troops is likely to prevail in the unfolding battle for Tikrit, but it would not have been possible if U.S. airstrikes had not tied down Islamic State fighters elsewhere in northern Iraq, the top U.S. general said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked by reporters traveling with him from Washington to Iraq whether he believes the Islamic State group will be pushed out of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dempsey said about 23,000 Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen and Iraqi soldiers are involved in the offensive, compared to only "hundreds" of IS fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The offensive is not what the Americans would consider textbook military tactics, he said, describing a hodge-podge of Iraqi Humvees, trucks and other vehicles surging toward Tikrit like rush hour on the Washington Beltway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I wouldn't describe it as a sophisticated military maneuver," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dempsey was flying overnight Friday to Iraq to meet with U.S. commanders and Iraqi government leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His visit comes at an intriguing stage of the war to force the Islamic State group out of Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Its fighters swept across much of northern and western Iraq last summer and now control numerous key cities, including Tikrit, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The U.S. and its allies have launched hundreds of airstrikes at IS targets since August and credits its attacks with halting the group's territorial advances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But in the Tikrit offensive, which began Monday, the U.S. is on the sidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It is watching as Iran asserts influence by providing training, weapons and leadership for Iraqi Shiite militias who are leading the charge on Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dempsey said he sees no evidence that the Iranian military is actually doing any of the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They have improved the Iraqi militias' fighting capabilities, but their role also has raised worries among America's coalition allies, who include Gulf Arab nations who despise Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Dempsey plans to visit one of those Gulf allies, Bahrain, during his trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The general said that while Iran is getting credit for enabling the Tikrit offensive, the full story of how it was made possible has not been told.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"If it weren't for the (U.S.-led coalition) air campaign over time depleting the ISIL forces in Beyji ... then the current campaign (in Tikrit) as currently constructed would not be militarily feasible," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Islamic State forces had surged into Beyji, which lies just north of Tikrit, in hopes of controlling a key oil refinery there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But they have been halted and tied down by a series of U.S. airstrikes, Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That little-noted IS setback has divided and weakened its forces, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The important thing about this operation in Tikrit is less about how the military aspect of it goes and more about what follows," Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The mostly Sunni population of Tikrit must be allow to returned to their homes, and the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad must step in with reconstruction and humanitarian aid, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The key task for Iraq's leaders, Dempsey said, is to balance the Iranian role in empowering Shiite militias with Iraq's partnership with the U.S. and other coalition members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The only one that can balance that is the prime minister of Iraq," Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"So I want to get his views on how he is seeking to balance that concern."</td></tr>
