<h3>Claims UN resisted Ebola declaration</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The delay, according to a series of internal emails and documents obtained by multinational US news agency The Associated Press, was partly for political reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Some argue waiting until last August instead of acting in June, according to the agency, may have cost lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>More than 10,000 people are believed to have been killed by the virus since WHO first announced the outbreak a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>WHO has acknowledged acting too slowly to control the epidemic, AP reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In its defence, the organisation says the virus's spread was unprecedented and several factors were to blame, including lack of resources and intelligence from the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Internal documents, however, show WHO's top leaders were informed of how dire the situation was but held off declaring an emergency partly so as not to anger the countries involved, interfere with mining interests or restrict the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Declaring an emergency was "a last resort" said Dr Sylvie Briand, who runs WHO's pandemic and epidemic diseases department, in a June 5 email to a colleague who floated the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Five days after Briand's email, WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan was sent a memo that warned cases might soon appear in Mali, Ivory Coast and Guinea Bissau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, it went on to say declaring an international emergency or even convening a committee to discuss it "could be seen as a hostile act".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Critics and former WHO staff dismiss the reasoning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"That's like saying you don't want to call the fire department because you're afraid the trucks will create a disturbance," said Michael Osterholm, a prominent infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The signs it was no ordinary outbreak - the panic, the health workers' deaths and the urban spread of the virus - were there from the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Many are recorded in a memo sent to WHO's Africa director on March 25, AP says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In mid-April, an experienced Ebola expert with WHO's Africa office wrote to Geneva, with disturbing news many staffers at a leading hospital in Guinea had been exposed to the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"What we see is the tip of an iceberg," Jean-Bosco Ndihokubwayo wrote in an email, writing in all caps: "WE NEED SUPPORT."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Ebola outbreak erupted at a difficult time for the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>WHO was also struggling to contain polio outbreaks - which it had declared an international emergency in May - and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At a June 2 meeting, one senior scientist warned the agency was "overwhelmed".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Declaring an international emergency might not necessarily have fixed all those problems - some argue it can create new ones - but it acts as a global distress signal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Dr Joanne Liu, the international president of Doctors Without Borders, said she had been lobbying Chan to sound the alarm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"You have the legitimacy and the authority to label it an emergency," Liu said she told Chan in a July 30 meeting in Geneva.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"You need to step up to the plate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The emergency was eventually declared on August 8, by which point nearly 1000 people had already died from Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>WHO's Ebola response leader, Dr Bruce Aylward, couldn't say whether an earlier declaration would have made a difference, noting that "the overall response slowed down" after the emergency was declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Had we declared it earlier, it is very, very difficult to say how perceptions would have affected the response," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Dr Matthieu Kamwa, a former WHO scientist, told AP such reasoning was contradictory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The declaration triggered a global deployment to contain the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>US President Barack Obama ordered up to 3000 troops to West Africa and promised to build more than a dozen 100-bed field hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Britain and France also pledged to build Ebola clinics; China sent a 59-person lab team and Cuba sent more than 400 health workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Kamwa says it's clear the alarm should have been sounded sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"People died because things were not done," he said.</td></tr>
