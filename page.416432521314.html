<h3>Mexico's Congress passes anti-corruption law</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY, April 22 (Reuters) - Mexico's Congress has approved an anti-corruption law that could help relieve pressure on President Enrique Pena Nieto's scandal-plagued government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The law, passed late on Tuesday night, strengthens oversight of public officials and designates a special prosecutor to tackle corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It comes after several previous efforts to pass anti-graft measures failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The reform will give new powers to Mexico's existing Federal Audit Office and the Public Administration Ministry (SFP), as well as creating a special court to oversee all corruption-related issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Details of the changes will be hashed out in secondary laws that must be passed in the next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Opposition parties joined with Pena Nieto's party to approve the law, but some anti-corruption organizations have expressed concern that the project will just give a face lift to existing institutions and will not address the low rate of prosecutions for corruption in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pena Nieto's focus on reforming Mexico's struggling economy has been overshadowed by scandals underscoring rampant impunity and passage of the law could ease pressure on his party ahead of mid-term elections in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Earlier this month, the head of Mexico's federal water authority resigned after he and his family used one of the agency's helicopters for personal travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last year, it was revealed that Pena Nieto, his wife and his finance minister had all bought or were using houses belonging to a government contractor involved in a consortium that won a high-speed train contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fernando Belaunzaran, a congressman with the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said the new law would put pressure on state governors to ensure spending is honest.</td></tr>
