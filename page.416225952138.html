<h3>Lawyer who sued after Ferguson wants special prosecutor in South Carolina man's shooting death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. - The attorney who brought a $40 million lawsuit following the fatal shooting of a black man by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, last year wants a special prosecutor to investigate a similar case in South Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Malik Shabazz, the president of Black Lawyers for Justice, says his group also will conduct its own investigation into the slaying of 50-year-old Walter Scott by a white officer April 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He also plans a nationwide town hall meeting next weekend to explore the issue of race and police practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Shabazz attended a rally at North Charleston City Hall attended by about 75 people on Monday, where he said it isn't enough that officer Michael Slager has been charged with murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"A charge to us doesn't mean anything. We want to see that the charges stick," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The shooting was captured on a cellphone video recorded by an eyewitness who was walking nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The footage shows Slager firing eight times as Scott is running away, then shows Scott falling to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The video has been seen by millions and resulted in the charge against Slager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We have reached the point and the tragic point that if you don't have video showing what happened," a shooting "is justifiable," Shabazz said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We're not going to be hunted down like deer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He added that "when we see dead bodies on the ground, we are at war," and said he was encouraging protesters to "stir the pot" to bring change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But he said he was not advocating violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Of course not, I'm an attorney," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Black Lawyers for Justice, founded by Shabazz, brought a lawsuit alleging Ferguson, Missouri, and St. Louis County used excessive force and falsely arrested bystanders to quell unrest after the fatal shooting of a black 18-year-old man by a white officer there last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Shabazz said whether a lawsuit is brought in South Carolina depends on what his investigation turns up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The response to the North Charleston shooting has been subdued, generally attributed to authorities immediately charging Slager with murder after the cellphone video surfaced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The State Law Enforcement Division released almost 13 hours of video from the cruisers of the five officers who responded to the scene of the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On one, Slager can be heard wondering aloud to an officer identified as his supervisor why Scott ran away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Scott was behind $18,000 in his child support payments and family members have said he may have run because he was worried about going back to jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A warrant had been issued for his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>On the video, Slager is heard answering a call on his cellphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Everything's OK, OK?" he tells the caller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I just shot somebody."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He also tells the caller: "He grabbed my Taser, yeah. He was running from me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Slager initially said after the shooting that Scott had tried to take his Taser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The man with the cellphone said he started recording after noticing a scuffle.</td></tr>
