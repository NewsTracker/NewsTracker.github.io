<h3>West Virginia train derailment sends oil tanker into river</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nearby residents were told to evacuate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A train carrying more than 100 tankers of crude oil derailed during a snowstorm in southern West Virginia on Monday, sending at least one tanker into a river, igniting at least 14 in all and sending a fireball hundreds of feet into the sky, officials and residents said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Part of the derailed train slammed into a house, residents said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officials evacuated hundreds of families and shut down two water treatment plants threatened by oil seeping into the river.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And fires were still burning nearly nine hours after the accident, according to state public safety division spokesman Lawrence Messina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The plan is to let those tankers on fire burn out, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>David McClung said he felt the heat from one of the explosions at his home about a half mile up the hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It was a little scary. It was like an atomic bomb went off," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of the explosions that followed sent a fireball at least 300 feet into the air, McClung said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One person was being treated for potential inhalation issues, but no other injuries were reported, according to a news release from CSX, the train company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The state was under a winter storm warning and getting heavy snowfall at times, with as much as 5 inches in some places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's not clear if the weather had anything to do with the derailment, which occurred about 1:20 p.m. along a flat stretch of rail about 30 miles southeast of Charleston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Federal railroad and hazardous materials officials are probing into the accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Responders at the scene reported at least one tanker went into the river, Messina said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Local emergency responders were having trouble getting to the house that caught fire, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Fourteen to 17 tankers caught fire or exploded, said Jennifer Sayre, the Kanawha County manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Becky Nuckols heard the train hit the house directly across the river from her house in the community of Boomer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I thought it was a snow plow," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"That's what made me look out. All you heard was a big boom."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After calling 911 Nuckols said she ran outside and saw a man leave the house and take off running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Officials opened shelters, while CSX reserved hotel rooms and opened an outreach center for affected residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The office of Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, which has issued a state of emergency, said the tanker cars were loaded with Bakken crude from North Dakota and headed to Yorktown, Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>All but two of the 109 cars being hauled were tanker cars, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>West Virginia American Water shut down a water treatment plant, located about 3 miles from the derailment, spokeswoman Laura Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Another water plant downstream in the town of Cedar Grove also closed its intake, state health officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The U.S. Transportation Department is weighing tougher safety regulations for rail shipments of crude, which can ignite and result in huge fireballs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Responding to a series of fiery train crashes, including one this spring in Lynchburg, Virginia, the government proposed rules in July that would phase out tens of thousands of older tank cars that carry increasing quantities of crude oil and other highly flammable liquids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It's not clear how old the tankers were on the derailed train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Lynchburg train also was hauling Bakken crude oil from North Dakota to Yorktown, Virginia.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali Nine: Indonesian Attorney-General delays transfer of pair but insists no delay in execution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The families of the Bali Nine drug smugglers facing execution have been given extra time to spend with the men, but the country's attorney general insists that they are not planning to delay their appointment with a firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attorney-General HM Prasetyo told Fairfax Media that he had taken the decision to override the actions of the Bali prosecutors office to swiftly transfer Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to Nusakambangan island in Central Java, where the executions will take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The office had flagged that the transfer to the maximum security Butu prison on the penal island could take place as early as Tuesday and would happen this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are responding to the requests from the Australian government and families," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We want the families to meet with Myuran and Andrew, to give them more time to be with the convicts on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is not delaying the executions. This is just to provide the families with more time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Asked how much more time the families would be granted, Mr Prasetyo said: "I don't know when. It's up to the Bali prosecutor's office. They are in charge of the transfer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Bali office could not be immediately reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As for the timing of the executions, Mr Prasetyo said it had yet to be confirmed and refused to be drawn on whether they will be this month, as his office had indicated in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We don't have a date."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he remained resolute that the executions would be carried out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This is not something easy. This is not something fun but this is what we must do," he told Fairfax Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran have lodged two separate appeals against their death sentences in the past fortnight.</td></tr>
