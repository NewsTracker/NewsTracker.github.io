<h3>Ronaldo scores 5 in Madrid's 9-1 rout of Granada</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ronaldo followed Gareth Bale's opener by netting his first three goals in an eight-minute span in the first half at the Santiago Bernabeu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Ballon d'Or holder added two more goals after halftime as Karim Benzema also netted a pair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was Ronaldo's first five-goal haul in La Liga and came in response to unexpected criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Usually protective of his players, Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Saturday that Ronaldo "had lowered his productivity" in the past two months as Madrid lost its league lead to Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ronaldo responded in emphatic fashion by netting his 43rd, 44th, 45th, 46th and 47th goals in his 41st game of the season in all competitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ronaldo's outburst moved him ahead of Lionel Messi in their individual duel to lead the scoring this season with 36 goals to the Barcelona forward's 32.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Madrid's lopsided victory came one round after losing at Barcelona and pulled it to within one point of the pacesetter before it visits Celta Vigo later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In other games, Valencia needs to beat Villarreal to recover third place and Deportivo La Coruna visits Getafe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Granada goalkeeper Oier Olazabal's long day began in the 25th minute when Bale won Toni Kroos' throughball and was all alone to dribble around Olazabal and poke the ball home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Five minutes later James Rodriguez marked his first game in two months after recovering from a broken right foot with an exquisite pass to set up Ronaldo for his first goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Olazabal was partly at fault for Ronaldo's next two goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ronaldo got his second when he blasted in a short clearance by Olazabal in the 36th before he drove a long strike through Olazabal's hands in the 38th for his hat trick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Benzema got into the act with a goal in the 52nd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ronaldo headed in Bale's pass two minutes later, and Benzema's deflected shot found the net in the 56th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Roberto Ibanez scored for Granada in the 74th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Diego Mainz scored an own goal with seven minutes left before Ronaldo got his final goal against Granada's demoralized defense in the 90th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Madrid's biggest home win in the league was an 11-2 victory over Elche in 1960.</td></tr>
