<h3>Court hears expert support for Bali Nine pair appeal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An expert witness has argued for the death row challenge of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to be heard in an Indonesian administrative court, testifying it is the correct forum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The court last month threw out a challenge against the rejection of clemency for the Bali Nine pair, determining the decrees by President Joko Widodo were not within its jurisdiction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The men sentenced for heroin smuggling in 2006 have no other legal avenues left and have resorted to the administrative court appeal to spare them from the firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Otong Rosadi of Ekasakti University on Monday gave his opinion in support of the challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The law expert said in his opinion, all "products of the law" can be reviewed, even clemency, which he argued was not purely a matter of presidential prerogative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The constitutional rights of the president were still a product of the law, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The legal product is the presidential decree and a presidential decree rejecting or granting clemency, it's a state administrative matter," he told the court in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The forum to challenge it is the state administrative court."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Otong maintained this view under questioning from lawyers for the state and judges, who asked if other constitutional rights of the president could also therefore be challenged in the administrative court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, Leonard Arpan, said he was confident Mr Otong's evidence was strong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I think the expert has delivered all the statements that were required," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both sides are due to give their conclusions on Wednesday for a decision soon afterwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>If they are given the chance, lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran will argue President Joko Widodo didn't properly assess their case - including their rehabilitation - before refusing clemency because they are drug offenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Several of the 10 prisoners in line for Indonesia's planned simultaneous mass execution are pursuing court action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has committed not to execute them before their legal avenues are exhausted, and has ordered those cases before the Supreme Court to be expedited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 10th prisoner, Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, will soon join the others on Nusakambangan island as her bid for a Supreme Court judicial review was rejected last week after a matter of days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The legal appeals of some of the death row prisoners Indonesia plans to execute alongside two Australians are being rushed through the courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The move comes at the request of Indonesia's Attorney General H.M. Prasetyo, who wants to settle on a date for the firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan's execution on Nusakambangan island has stalled while Jakarta waits for them and other death row drug offenders to use up their legal avenues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Of the 10 awaiting the firing squad, four are pursuing cases in the administrative court and three are seeking Supreme Court judicial reviews - a move that has already failed for the Bali Nine pair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Prasetyo's office on Thursday confirmed the judicial review application of a Filipino woman had been rejected after only days before the Supreme Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It usually takes three months to consider such applications but Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso's was distributed to three judges on March 20 and rejected on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Veloso was considered to have a good chance for a review and it was thought this would delay the executions for some months, as Indonesia insists on sending 10 prisoners to the firing squad simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr Prasetyo says he has negotiated with the Supreme Court to ensure the fastest turnaround.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It means there will be no more legal avenues left."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The other two prisoners seeking judicial reviews are Frenchman Serge Atlaoui and Ghanian Martin Anderson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran have an appeal in the administrative court, that if won, would see their lawyers argue the blanket rejection of clemency did not follow due process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>President Joko Widodo is denying clemency to all death row drug offenders, regardless of rehabilitation or other factors, believing it will shock Indonesia out of its drug problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>An expert witness for Chan and Sukumaran's defence could not attend court on Wednesday and was scheduled for Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The attorney-general says the case is "unusual".</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"The last I heard, the two Bali Nine convicts couldn't bring their expert witness to prove their reasoning," he reportedly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Their challenge of clemency is unusual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"It's the president's discretion and so there shouldn't be anyone who can prevent it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Lawyers for Veloso thought she had a good chance for a judicial review because she did not have a qualified translator at her trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The 30-year-old single mother was arrested at a central Java airport in 2010, with 2.6kg of heroin in her suitcase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Her lawyers and family say she's an unwitting victim of an international syndicate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan's lawyers are set to make their case for an appeal of the presidential decree that denied them clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The state administrative court last month rejected the clemency rejection challenge, which has sent the pair a step closer to the firing squad for their 2005 heroin smuggling bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The court threw out the challenge on jurisdictional grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Lawyer for the Australians, Doly James, says his team on Wednesday will present documented evidence to support the case for the administrative court to hear the appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"We still have hope for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran," he told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"There were errors in the issuing of the clemency rejection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"I'm not denying the prerogative rights of the president. But the president must also comply with the ethics and principle of good governance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"The decision is still the president's prerogative but the process should not be reckless either, the president must be responsible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Last week the court laid out a timetable for the appeal, asking that it wrap up on April 1 for a decision soon afterwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>If they are granted the appeal, lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran will argue President Joko Widodo didn't properly assess their clemency case - including their well-documented rehabilitation - before issuing a blanket rejection to the Australians as drug offenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has committed not to execute Chan and Sukumaran before their legal avenues are exhausted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Seven of 10 prisoners in line for execution are pursuing court action and Mr Prasetyo says he will respect all of their legal processes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Meanwhile, Chan and Sukumaran wait in lonely conditions on Nusakambangan island where the simultaneous executions are planned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says she does not expect to be updated on the situation until the legal appeals are complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Indonesia's Foreign Ministry meanwhile says it has passed on a request from Prime Minister Tony Abbott to speak by phone to Mr Joko, and it is now in the hands of the presidential palace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>A Jakarta court has given lawyers for Bali Nine pair Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan five days to build their appeal for a court to hear their clemency case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan's lawyers will return to court next week in their appeal against a decision to throw out their death row challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Their legal team wants to argue President Joko Widodo didn't properly assess their case, including their well-documented rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The State Administrative Court last month wouldn't hear the case on jurisdictional grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>They appealed, and the same court on Thursday adjourned until Wednesday, when they will return with supporting evidence including expert witnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Lawyers for the state will respond on the following Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Judge Ujang Abdullah set a final hearing for April 1, with a decision to be announced shortly afterwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, Leonard Arpan, said after the hearing they would have to wait until Wednesday to see what evidence their team would bring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>"Actually their response is not apples to apples with ours," he said, meaning the state hadn't countered all of the issues in the appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Mr Arpan would not discuss what further legal appeals may be planned for the Australians, who are already incarcerated on the island where Indonesia plans to execute them for their role in a 2005 drug smuggling plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Meanwhile Australia's new ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Grigson, on Thursday presented his credentials to Mr Joko at the State Palace in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>New ambassadors for New Zealand, Hungary, the Philippines, Iran and Panama also met Mr Joko and Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Jakarta is indicating it would prefer to wait for the legal appeals of some of the 10 death row drug convicts it plans to kill to clear, in order to leave "no problems behind" afterwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Seven of the 10 have appeals of some sort, and the attorney-general plans to execute them simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>The executions would take place on Nusakambangan island, Central Java, where Chan and Sukumaran are now jailed in quarantine cells.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>The Bali Nine pair's case goes back to a Jakarta court today with hopes their cases for clemency can finally be heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan's lawyers are going back to court with their last bid to save the men from the firing squad and indications from Jakarta it will respect the legal process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>The Australians' hopes ride on an appeal in Jakarta administrative court on Thursday against the denial of their clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>It was adjourned last Thursday when lawyers for the president had not completed paperwork require to appear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Lawyers for the Australians argue President Joko Widodo didn't properly assess their case - including their well-documented rehabilitation - before rubber-stamp rejecting their clemency as drug offenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Jakarta is indicating it would prefer to wait for the legal appeals to clear of some of the 10 death row drug convicts it plans to kill, in order to leave "no problems behind" afterwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Seven prisoners are exploring legal options and Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has never specified which appeals he's waiting for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, who was scheduled to face the firing squad with Chan and Sukumaran, has been granted a judicial review, which typically takes three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>This has raised hopes of a lengthy delay in the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>But there's also a possibility Jakarta will instead remove Veloso from the execution list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>While Jakarta deliberates, Chan and Sukumaran wait in lonely conditions on Nusakambangan island, where the simultaneous executions are planned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Their families and friends visited on Wednesday before several return home to Sydney and Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says Jakarta has not conveyed to Canberra a change of heart about the execution of the convicted Australian drug runners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>"I learn a great deal about this case through the Indonesian media," she told ABC radio on Wednesday, referring to reports the execution might be delayed by up to three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Some Liberal MPs reportedly are concerned about the government's focus on the Bali Nine members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>West Australian MP Luke Simpkins raised the issue during a party-room meeting on Tuesday, according to the ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>He suggested the government had "exhausted all avenues" and needed to shift focus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have visited the death-row prisoners on Indonesia's Nusakamgangan prison and will now have to wait until Monday before they can see them again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are awaiting Jakarta's next move after another death row convict was granted an appeal that will take months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso has been granted a judicial review, which typically takes three months and could ensure the Bali Nine pair avoid the firing squad for months, as Jakarta has indicated it prefers to wait for all legal appeals to be heard before killing 10 drug convicts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>However, the attorney-general's office says it's also considering taking some prisoners off the execution list pending their appeals, meaning they'd execute fewer than 10 in the next round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's families and friends will visit today before several head home to Sydney because of the delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>The pair's lawyers meanwhile are preparing for an appeal in Jakarta administrative court tomorrow against the denial of clemency.</td></tr>
