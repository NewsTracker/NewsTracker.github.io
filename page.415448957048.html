<h3>Cameroon says 25 Boko Haram suspects died in custody</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 25 suspects were found dead in their cell one day after being arrested in December, Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said in a press conference Friday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They were part of a group of 56 detainees, and the cause of their deaths is still being determined, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I can already state here that at this stage of investigation, no evidence has been established to corroborate that these persons were deliberately killed," Bakary said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He added that a senior military official had been removed from his post and was being investigated over the deaths, though he did not identify this person by name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In January, the Network of Human Rights Defenders in Central Africa, based in the capital, Yaounde, cited "reliable sources" in claiming that 50 Boko Haram suspects had suffocated to death in their cells before being buried in a mass grave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The group's report accused the army of engaging in rights violations including torture "with impunity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Boko Haram has been fighting a nearly 6-year insurgency against the Nigerian government, killing thousands and carrying out mass kidnappings, including of schoolgirls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The conflict has taken on an increasingly international dimension in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Cameroon's northern region was repeatedly targeted by Boko Haram before the country signed up to participate in a multinational force that has dislodged the group from a score of northeastern Nigerian towns in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nigeria acknowledged on Thursday that it is getting help from regional security operatives amid reports that South Africa and other foreign contractors are involved in the fight against Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Also on Thursday, Islamic State militants in the Middle East accepted a pledge of allegiance from Boko Haram, though it is unclear how the groups might be able to cooperate effectively.</td></tr>

<h3>Kerry Says It's 'Unclear' Whether Iran Nuclear Deal Deadline Can Be Met</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kerry made the comments on March 14 at an investment conference in Egypt's Red Sea resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The remarks come just ahead of a fresh round of talks with Iran in Switzerland set to begin on March 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kerry said, "We continue to be focused on reaching the right deal, a deal which would protect the world, including the United States and our closest allies and partners, from a threat that a nuclear armed Iran could pose."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Kerry added, "We still don't know whether or not we will get there" and said that "important gaps" still remain in the bargaining process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Nothing in our deliberations is decided until everything is decided," Kerry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kerry also mentioned the March 9 letter authored by 47 Republican senators that was sent to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei warning that the deal currently being negotiated could be canceled after the next U.S. presidential elections when a new president takes office in early 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kerry called the letter "direct interference in the negotiations of the executive department" and said it would inevitably "raise questions in the minds of folks with whom we are negotiating."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Khamenei already commented on the letter on March 12, saying U.S. officials habitually become "harsher, tougher, and coarser" when progress is being made in negotiations and adding the United States is known for its "deceit and backstabbing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The United States and five other powers have set a deadline of the end of March for a framework deal on Iran's nuclear program, which many countries suspect may be a cover for making weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iran claims its nuclear program is peaceful.</td></tr>
