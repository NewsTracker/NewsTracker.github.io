<h3>Ireland eye historic Six Nations win against Wales</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ireland are on the brink of their best run of form in international rugby after beating England two weeks ago to claim a 10th successive win, matching their feat set between 2002 and 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Under New Zealander Joe Schmidt, Ireland have risen to third in the world rankings having gone 12 months unbeaten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This current run began last March against England and has included wins over South Africa, Australia and two Tests in Argentina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Now Wales present possibly the biggest remaining hurdle towards only a second Grand Slam in 67 years before facing Scotland, ranked seven places below them, in the final round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However the Millennium Stadium will hold happy memories for many of this team given their last clean sweep in the Six Nations, in 2009, was here in Cardiff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>More surprising still is that they have achieved this remarkable sequence immediately following the loss of arguably their greatest player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Any fears the departure of Brian O'Driscoll would blunt either their effectiveness or cutting edge have been swiftly dispelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It will be another of their modern-day talismans that takes centre-stage this week when captain Paul O'Connell wins his 100th cap for the Emerald Isle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The 35-year-old veteran of three British & Irish tours began his Test career with a try on his debut during a 54-10 rout of Wales in 2002 that was to see Graham Henry sacked as head coach of the Welsh dragons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This week he faces another Kiwi coach in charge of Wales for what is expected to be as much a battle of tactics and wit as brawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Warren Gatland has brought huge success to Wales, following three Championship titles in seven years as well as success with the Lions, but has yet to rid his team of their sometimes maddening inconsistency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gatland is only too aware that his side were swept aside by Ireland in Dublin last year and failed to show up for the second half of this year's opening match against England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However they recovered to register back-to-back wins away to Scotland and France and are threatening to repeat their feat of 2013 when they became the first team to lift the Six Nations trophy after losing their opening game, in Cardiff to Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gatland said: "It's a massive game for us. If we win then we're still in the Championship going into the last week. But we have to be mentally right for Ireland. In the last few games against them we just haven't been on the edge," said Gatland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Ireland are currently third in the world and have found a style that is proving very successful, so we're under no illusions what is coming our way. We just have to be ready and able to cope with the pressure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Gatland has kept faith with the team that won 20-13 in Paris a fortnight ago, which means Sam Warburton will become Wales' longest-serving captain, surpassing Ryan Jones when he leads his country for a 34th time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ireland have made just one change to the side that beat England with No8 Jamie Heaslip returning from three fractured vertebrae suffered against France while fly-half Jonathan Sexton and flanker Sean O'Brien both passed fitness tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Schmidt team's may have changed little but he rejected accusations his team were one-dimensional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said: "A lot has been made about our kicking but we have also passed the ball more than our opponents. Every team plays to their strengths and while those strengths may be known, if you do them well then they can still be enough."</td></tr>
