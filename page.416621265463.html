<tr><td>17</td><td>The protest was comparatively small and no demonstrators were detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But it reflected growing anger over bottlenecks that delayed much-needed relief four days after the powerful earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people, injured twice that many and left tens of thousands homeless.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>While the death toll in the village of Gumda was low - only five people were killed and 20 were injured among 1,300 residents - most had lost their homes and desperately needed temporary shelter, along with the 40-kilogram (90-pound) sacks of rice that were delivered Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Adding to residents' misery was the rain that has fallen periodically since the quake and hampered helicopter aid flights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The U.N. World Food Program warned that it will take time for food and other supplies to reach more remote communities that have been cut off by landslides.</td></tr>

<tr><td>35</td><td>Anop Bhattachan and more than two dozen relatives have been sleeping on the field since Saturday, but he said they now want to get out of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Thousands waited at bus stations in Kathmandu, hoping to reach their hometowns in rural areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Some wanted to check on the fate of family and loved ones in the quake, while others were fearful of more aftershocks in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"I am hoping to get on a bus, any bus heading out of Kathmandu. I am too scared to be staying in Kathmandu," said Raja Gurung, who wanted to get to his home in western Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"The house near my rented apartment collapsed. It was horrible. I have not gone indoors in many days. I would rather leave than live a life of fear in Kathmandu."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Despite Wednesday's small protest, there were signs that life was inching back to normal in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Banks opened for a few hours and refilled their ATMs with cash, some shops reopened and vendors returned to the streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Even though Nabin and Laxmi Shrestha remained frightened about aftershocks, the husband and wife have reopened their tea shop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"I'm scared, but people are hungry. We need to feed them," Laxmi Shrestha said.</td></tr>
