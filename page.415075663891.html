<h3>Protests after US blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Dhaka to denounce the murder of a prominent American blogger of Bangladeshi origin, who was hacked to death with machetes after he allegedly received threats from Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The demonstrators - including teachers, publishers and fellow writers - met near the spot where Avijit Roy, founder of Mukto-Mona (Free-Mind) blog, was attacked by unknown assailants as he returned home from a book fair with his wife on Thursday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>No one has yet claimed responsibility for the vicious attack, which also seriously wounded the 44-year-old blogger's wife and has shocked many in a country already reeling from weeks of violent political protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The atheist writer's father Ajoy Roy said he had received numerous threats from Islamists via email and social media before his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The attack on Roy and his wife Rafida Ahmed is outrageous," the head of a Bangladeshi bloggers' association, Imran H Sarker, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We strongly protest this attack and are deeply concerned about the safety of writers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dr Roy, a US citizen, is the second Bangladeshi atheist blogger to have been murdered in two years and the fourth writer to have been attacked since 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called it "a shocking act of violence" that was "horrific in its brutality and cowardice".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ms Psaki told a regular news briefing she had no information as to the motive for the attack, but said the US was ready to assist the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hardline Islamist groups have long demanded the public execution of atheist bloggers and sought new laws to combat writing critical of Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police have launched an investigation and recovered the machetes used in the attack, which they compared to that on atheist blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Haider was hacked to death by members of a little-known Islamist militant group, triggering nationwide protests by tens of thousands of secular activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The pattern of the killing appeared to be the same as that of a previous attack on a celebrated writer," Dhaka police assistant commissioner Shiblee Noman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Assistant Commissioner Noman also said police were investigating a tweet by the pro-Islamist group Ansar Bangla Seven that appeared to celebrate Dr Roy's murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Target Down here in #Bangladesh," the group tweeted from the @AnsarBn7 handle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dr Roy had written about 10 books, including the best-selling "Biswasher Virus" (Virus of Faith), as well as his blog, which championed liberal secular writing in the Muslim-majority nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Centre for Inquiry, a US-based charity promoting free thought, said it was "shocked and heartbroken" by the brutal murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Dr Roy was a true ally, a courageous and eloquent defender of reason, science, and free expression, in a country where those values have been under heavy attack," it said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The killing also triggered strong condemnation from fellow writers and publishers, who lamented the growing religious conservatism and intolerance in Bangladesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Pinaki Bhattacharya, a fellow blogger and friend of Dr Roy, said one of the country's largest online book retailers was being openly threatened for selling Dr Roy's books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"In Bangladesh, the easiest target is an atheist. An atheist can be attacked and murdered," he wrote on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>After Mr Haider's death, Bangladesh's hardline Islamist groups started to protest against other campaigning bloggers, accusing them of blasphemy and calling a series of nationwide strikes to demand their execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reacted by arresting some atheist bloggers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The government also blocked about a dozen websites and blogs to stem the furore over blasphemy, as well as stepping up security for the bloggers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Bangladesh is the world's fourth-largest Muslim majority nation with Muslims making up some 90 per cent of the country's 160 million people.</td></tr>
