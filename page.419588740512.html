<tr><td>5</td><td>(AP) - Maryland moved the last inmates out of the dangerously decrepit men's section of the Baltimore City Detention Center on Tuesday, state officials said, completing the closure of the notorious facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The jail pre-dates modern penal facility standards, with some of its walls dating to the 19th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It has been known for its hazardous conditions, including blind corners and dark corridors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It also has been the target of reform attempts for decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The final closure of this detention center removes a stain on the reputation of our state and Maryland's correctional system," Hogan said in a statement announcing the removal of all detainees by 5 p.m. Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"For years, corruption, criminal activity, and deplorable conditions have plagued this facility, but that ends today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In June, the American Civil Liberties Union and Public Justice Center asked a federal judge to reopen a lawsuit against the state over what they said were conditions so substandard it brings "shame to this city."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Attorneys cited moldy showers and cells infested with mice and cockroaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They also said medical care was poor or nonexistent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hogan, a Republican, announced plans July 30 to close the state-run jail, where a sweeping federal indictment in 2013 exposed a sophisticated drug- and cellphone-smuggling ring involving dozens of gang members and correctional officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The investigation also exposed sexual relations between jailhouse gang leader Tavon White and female guards that left four of them pregnant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Forty of the 44 defendants charged in the racketeering conspiracy were convicted, including 24 correctional officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Thirty-five defendants pleaded guilty; eight defendants went to trial and one defendant died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>White pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Hogan said the closure would save the state $10 million to $15 million annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Soon after the announcement, officials began moving about 1,100 inmates and detainees to other Baltimore-area detention centers, keeping them in proximity to local courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Maryland lawmakers say they have yet to be informed where exactly the inmates and detainees have been moved, and they have questions about the administration's long-term plans to house the detainees and inmates.</td></tr>
