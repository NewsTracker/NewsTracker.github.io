<h3>Bali nine: Indonesian president Joko Widodo says executions will not be this week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When asked about the rehabilitation of the two Australians, Mr Joko said he could not discriminate between people from different countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran is surrounded by masked security personnel upon arriving at Cilacap airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I think the decision (to execute Chan and Sukumaran) was already taken by the court," he said during an interview with al-Jazeera on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers have appealed against the president's rejection of the men's clemency pleas, on the basis he did not consider their cases on an individual basis or take into account their reformation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The men instigated a number of vocational courses in Bali's Kerobokan prison, including art, life-saving, philosophy, sewing, computer and bible study classes, which have changed the lives of other inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Riot police gather outside Kerobokan prison for the transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, Mr Joko said he had looked at the cases of the prisoners who are facing imminent execution on Nusakambangan island before rejecting their pleas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I looked at how many drugs they were carrying, how many kilograms they distributed," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Joko has previously indicated he was unaware the Bali nine were arrested trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin to Australia rather than bringing drugs into Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Pressure: Indonesian President Joko Widodo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Asked how he felt about the death penalty as a person, Mr Joko reiterated his concern about the 4.5 million people in Indonesia whose lives are "in ruin" because of drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If you come to drug rehabilitation centres, you will see the effect drugs have on these people," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"You don't just look at the people who sell the drugs, you also have to look at their victims."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bali nine death row inmates Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran transferred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Asked if there could be no alternative punishment given Indonesia's notoriously corrupt legal system, Mr Joko said he was still convinced the justice system in Indonesia was valid when it came to drug crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Indonesian Attorney-General's office refused to confirm to Fairfax Media that the executions would not be held this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Meanwhile, cabinet secretary Andi Widjajanto said the president told cabinet and the Attorney-General to take the concerns of the Australian government over the execution very seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran boards the flight for Nusakambangan in Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We realise it creates a kind of tension between Indonesia," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Andi said there were similar tensions with the Dutch government, which withdrew its ambassador after one of its citizens was executed on January 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We take the concern of our friendly neighbour seriously. So the president asked the Attorney-General to coordinate with the foreign minister in processing the execution plans."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran were on Wednesday transferred to the penal island known as Indonesia's Alcatraz in a massive display of military might.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Australians, who will be executed with eight other drug felons, will be given 72 hours notice of their deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo is expected to hold a press conference on Friday to announce the timing of the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Asked on Wednesday if the executions would take place this week, Mr Prasetyo said "We will see", adding that he was waiting on the latest report on the killing field, the firing squad and the religious counsellors who will accompany the prisoners in their final hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He has repeatedly said the executions would be held as soon as possible once all those facing the firing squad were on Nusakambangan Island because prison authorities were concerned about the unsettling effect of condemned men and women on other prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Australian government, which was not informed of the plan to transfer the prisoners on Wednesday, warned of repercussions if the men are executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I am sure that Indonesia understands it will have consequences," Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Channel Nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>However, she said Australia was unlikely to recall Australian Ambassador-designate Paul Grigson from Indonesia in the wake of the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Brazil and the Netherlands both withdrew their ambassadors to protest their citizens being shot in the first round of executions held on January 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also warned Australians against taking out their anger at the looming executions in Indonesia but confirmed the Australia-Indonesia relationship was going through a "very difficult period".</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mr Abbott said he was "revolted" at the prospect of the executions and said "millions of Australians feel quite angry" and "sick in the guts" about what is happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"But I've got to say anger is not a very good basis on which to determine a nation's policies and in the long run anger is not a very good basis on which to determine your own conduct."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Streets were blocked off in Bali and two buses of crowd control police carrying riot shields and batons were at Kerobokan prison before dawn on Wednesday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A water cannon was also sent to the prison in case of trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In a dramatic demonstration of force, Chan and Sukumaran were flown to Cilacap, the closest town to Nusakambangan, accompanied by two Sukhoi fighter jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The pair were transferred to Wijaya Pura port in a Barracuda - an armoured personnel carrier - as part of a long convey of police and military vehicles, many of which had sirens blaring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>There were chaotic scenes at the port, with armed police officers lining the streets as the Barracuda was driven onto a ferry to make the brief voyage across the narrow strait to the penal colony that has become known as death island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's families are making the agonising final journey to Cilacap, where they will be allowed to visit the Australians until just before the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said family members would be able to visit Chan and Sukumaran until a few hours before the execution when they would be placed in an isolation cell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In Indonesian executions only a religious figure can accompany a prisoner on death row during their final hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"There will be the last moments when contact with others will be limited," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He confirmed the prisoners would each face a firing squad of 12 executioners, three of whom will have live ammunition, so no-one will know who fired the fatal shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>A commando will also be present to shoot the men in the head if they are not dead after 10 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"We want to show the world that Indonesia is truly trying hard to fight drugs," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said authorities were considering the last wishes of the Bali nine pair, including which religious figures would witness their deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>It is understood Chan, himself a qualified minister, would like to be accompanied by a family friend who is a pastor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Meanwhile, Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi - who some credit as the most influential musician in the creation of heavy metal music - has appealed to the metal-loving Indonesian president to spare the lives of the two Australians on death row.</td></tr>

<h3>Impotent Western Sanctions Fail to Disrupt Russian Energy Exports</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In some ways, the sanctions have had the desired effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But in others, notably the energy trade, they have failed, and in fact it could be argued they have backfired, by hurting the businesses that do business with Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Moreover, the sanctions have further isolated Russia from Europe and drawn it closer to alternative energy partners, namely Turkey and China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>To recap, in March of 2014 the United States and the European Union, along with other countries and international organizations, implemented a series of sanctions against individuals and businesses from Russia and Ukraine, in response to the perceived annexation of Crimea, a peninsula in southern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russia retaliated by imposing sanctions of its own, including a ban on food imports from the EU, US, Norway, Canada and Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As the unrest continued into southern and eastern Ukraine, the sanctions were expanded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The first round targeted Russian and Crimean officials seen to have close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, with asset freezes and bans on travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The second round, so-called sectoral sanctions, focused on major businesses and parts of Russia's financial, energy and military industries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Targets included Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In December of 2014, US President Obama signed a bill allowing the White House to levy further sanctions against Russia, although no action has yet been taken to introduce them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The new US sanctions would hit Russia's state-owned energy and defense industries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Read more: Russia Prepared To Sell Strategic Deposits, But Who's Buying?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It is important to understand what exactly the sanctions apply to and what they exclude, because even a surface analysis shows that Russian energy exports are continuing apace, and in some areas, even increasing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The first example is coal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Despite sanctions, Russian coal is moving at higher volumes to the European countries most dependent on the cheap fossil fuel for home heating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>German coal imports are the highest since 2006, as importers take advantage of a lower ruble and lower oil prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>According to the news site RT, Germany imported over 12 million tonnes of coal from Russia in 2014, despite the country's reputation as a leader in renewable energy, symbolized through "energiewende", the much-lauded plan to switch Germany from nuclear power and fossil fuels to renewables.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The dirty truth is that Germany gets about half of its electricity from coal, with the other half coming from natural gas and nuclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>About a third of German coal comes from Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In addition, the former World War adversaries also trade a lot of natural gas; 25 billion cubic meters per year imported by Germany, to be exact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Other countries have jumped on the Russian coal train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Poland is the second-biggest consumer of Russian coal behind Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ukraine - whose territory Russian natural gas must cross in order to reach its destination in Europe- has quietly been buying Russian coal, fueled no doubt from constant threats by natgas provider Gazprom to shut off the taps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The latest threat came on Feb. 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>According to RT, Ukraine bought 50,000 tons of Russian coal in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Then there's the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>As President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry last year lambasted Russia for supporting pro-separatist rebels in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, and accused the Kremlin of involvement in the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner, a huge coal carrier was crossing the ocean to deliver 40,000 tons of thermal coal to the Schiller Station coal-fired power plant in New Hampshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Forbes broke down the reasons for the apparent contradiction nicely, stating that for the East Coast, Russian coal is "easy to get and cheaper to ship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>An added advantage: coal from Russia emits less sulfur than US coal, making it easier to comply with environmental regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Many US citizens would also be horrified to learn that a considerable amount of nuclear power produced in the United States comes from Russian uranium, none of which is yet subject to Western sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>According to the US government's National Nuclear Security Administration, about half of the fuel used in American nuclear reactors comes from dismantled Soviet warheads, purchased under the $12-billion "Megatons to Megawatts" program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>While that program expired in 2013, Russia continues to work with the United States in supplying enrichment facilities to enrich uranium for use in nuclear power plants as Russia is the world leader in supplying enriched uranium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In 2012 the two countries reached six-year deals to supply over $1 billion worth of reactor fuel to four American utilities, and to provide enrichment services for the US Enrichment Corporation (USEC) for nine years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>According to a report by The Jamestown Foundation, "[if] US sanctions extend to include the Russian nuclear industry, one of the biggest losers could well be the US nuclear industry itself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Marin Katusa, chief energy investment strategist for Casey Research, agrees that sanctions will have a negative effect on the American economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Katusa, whose recent book "The Colder War" outlines Vladimir Putin's strategy for worldwide energy domination, quotes former Texas congressman Ron Paul as saying that "The US government's decision to apply more sanctions on Russia is a grave mistake and will only escalate an already tense situation, ultimately harming the US itself. While the effect of sanctions on the dollar may not be appreciated in the short term, in the long run these sanctions are just another step toward the dollar's eventual demise as the world's reserve currency."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>If there is one area in the energy sphere where sanctions have had an appreciable effect, it's oil and gas exploration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>While current supplies to the West remain unaffected, the sanctions target Russia's long-term oil and gas operations and future projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>This includes construction of future pipelines, technology used in offshore drilling, and equipment for LNG plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Probably the biggest loser so far has been ExxonMobil, which over the past two years has been collaborating with Russia's largest oil company, Rosneft, to conduct exploration and research in the Black Sea and Arctic Ocean, as well as onshore in western Siberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In December, as a result of Western sanctions, the two companies terminated contracts for five service vessels that were to begin operating in the Kara Sea, after ExxonMobil made a billion-barrel discovery last September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"In compliance with the sanctions and all general and specific licenses, prohibited activities involving offshore Russia in the Black Sea, Arctic regions, and onshore western Siberia have been wound down," the report states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Geopolitically, sanctions have accelerated Russia's shift of focus from Europe, its traditional market for oil and gas, to China and Turkey - with the latter being an important conduit for getting gas to Europe while avoiding the Ukraine quagmire, and the former as an important buyer of Russian gas that has blithely ignored Western sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>As proof, consider that last October, Russia and China signed 38 energy, trade and finance agreements, along with a currency swap worth 150 billion Chinese yuan ($25 billion) that assiduously avoids using the US dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The agreements - which include a deepening of cooperation between Rosneft and the Chinese National Petroleum Company in building LNG projects - followed a colossal $400-billion deal between the two nations to supply China with Russian gas for the next 30 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Indeed the shift from west to east is already occurring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Russian energy data released last fall showed crude supplies to China from January to September rose by almost 45 percent, while shipments to Europe via the Black Sea port of Primorsk fell almost 20 percent, according to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>In a further undermining of Russian sanctions, Chinese credit rating agency Dagong Global in February gave Gazprom its highest AAA rating, allowing the company to place its shares in Hong Kong and expand its investor base in the Asia Pacific region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Western ratings agencies like Moody's, S&P and Fitch have all downgraded Russia's sovereign rating to junk or near-junk levels, said IBT Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The sanctions have also pushed Russia away from European trade partners and into the arms of Turkey, the largest consumer of Russian gas behind Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The long-envisioned South Stream pipeline that would have carried Europe-bound Russian gas underneath the Black Sea through Bulgaria, was abruptly cancelled in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Instead, the Kremlin announced that a new pipeline, known as Turkish (or Turk) Stream, would run from Russia under the Black Sea to the Turkish town of Kiyikoy, before continuing overland to the Greek border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The same month, Russian President Putin praised Turkey for refusing to join Western sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, while also announcing a near tripling of trade between the two countries from $32.7 billion to $100 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Turkey is able to avoid Western sanctions because it is an EU accession member, not a full member, Breitbart.com pointed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The relationship building came despite Russia's differences with Turkey over Syria, with Russia supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey pushing for regime change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Russian aggression in Ukraine certainly put its Western trading partners in a quagmire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>While the stick of sanctions, exacerbated by plunging oil prices, has paid off from a Western point of view in terms of halving the value of the ruble, spiking inflation and causing Russia's first contraction of GDP in five years, they have also had a boomerang effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Victims of sanctions and countersanctions include American poultry businesses, which export around $300 million a year worth of chicken to Russia; European businesses that export to Russia; and big oil companies like BP and ExxonMobil that have had their exploration activities curtailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>An editorial in the Japan Times quotes the chairman of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, as saying that sanctions against Russia could cause 300,000 layoffs in Germany and 100,000 in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>The last word goes to Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, who in the same editorial, states "the sanctions policy pursued by the West causes more harm to us than to Russia. In politics, this is called shooting oneself in the foot."</td></tr>
