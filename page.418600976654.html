<h3>U.S. asked for custody of Joaquin (El Chapo) Guzman: Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mexico's government received an extradition request from the United States for Joaquin (El Chapo) Guzman a couple of weeks before the drug lord's escape from prison last Saturday, a government spokesman said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The request was made on June 25 via a diplomatic note, the spokesman said in response to a question from Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The confirmation followed comments made by Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong to reporters late on Thursday that suggested a request had, in fact, been made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mexico had previously said it expected a request but had indicated in January that Guzman would not be handed over because he would serve time in his home country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Guzman is wanted by U.S. authorities for a variety of criminal charges including cocaine smuggling and money laundering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He broke out of Mexico's top maximum security prison through a tunnel that surfaced right into his cell.</td></tr>
