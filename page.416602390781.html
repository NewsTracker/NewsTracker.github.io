<h3>Greek Minister Attacked by Anarchists While Dining in Athens</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's outspoken finance minister said Wednesday he and his wife came under attack by anarchists while dining in a central Athens restaurant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yanis Varoufakis said the couple were finishing dinner with a friend in the Exarhia district, a neighborhood popular with extreme leftists and anarchists, Tuesday night when a group barged into the restaurant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The group, who had their faces covered, demanded the minister leave the area and threw glass objects at the couple, Varoufakis said, without either of them being hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said that when some of the group moved in a threatening manner against him, his wife embraced him so that the potential attackers could not get at him without hitting her first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This was not an organised incident," Varoufakis said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said he eventually spoke with the group outside the restaurant and tempers were calmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Similar attacks against government ministers were frequent in the first years of Greece's bailout, which began in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Those were believed to have been carried out by groups affiliated to the left wing, though generally not by anarchists, and sometimes involved attempted physical violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>With his outspoken - some would say brash - style and prolific appearance in media interviews, Varoufakis became Greece's best-known minister of the new radical left Syriza party-led coalition government after Jan. 25 elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But he has come under severe criticism from the country's European creditors, with whom negotiations on unlocking the final 7.2 billion-euro installment of Greece's bailout have foundered for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Monday, Greece announced a reshuffle of its negotiating team, widely seen as a sidelining of Varoufakis.</td></tr>
