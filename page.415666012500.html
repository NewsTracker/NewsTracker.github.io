<h3>Ebola orphans need Australia&#039;s help: Plan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A year since the first Ebola case was diagnosed in West Africa, Australians are being asked not to forget the biggest victims: children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Plan International Australia says Ebola still claims 26 lives every day in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Its disaster manager Rohan Kent says fear of the virus is resulting in Ebola orphans being shunned and neglected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An estimated 16,600 children have lost one or both parents to Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>These children have become vulnerable to malnutrition, neglect, depression, teenage prostitution and dropping out of school to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is hugely important right now that we do not forget the children caught up in this continuing crisis," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are at risk of losing an entire generation, and children in West Africa need our support right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>* More than 20 per cent of Ebola orphans not properly supervised or fed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>* Reduced family income forcing more children into work and sexual exploitation.</td></tr>
