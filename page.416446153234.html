<h3>Millsap scores 19, Hawks hold off Nets 96-91 for 2-0 lead (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA (AP) -- Paul Millsap answered all those questions about his shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Al Horford didn't let a dislocated finger slow him down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As for the Hawks, they've yet to show the form that carried them to the top of the Eastern Conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>1-seeded Atlanta again survived a tougher-than-expected test from the Brooklyn Nets, holding on for a 96-91 victory and a 2-0 lead in their playoff series Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''We're kind of playing on the edge right now,'' Horford said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Millsap, who missed five games near the end of the season with a sprained right shoulder, ditched a pad that he felt restricted his shooting motion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He responded by hitting 7 of 11 shots and finished with 19 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Horford also looked fine, scoring 14 points while leading the Hawks with 13 rebounds and seven assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He did it all with his right hand taped, after dislocating his pinky finger in Game 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''Once the game started, I was good,'' Horford said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kyle Korver chipped in with 17 points, knocking down three shots beyond the arc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But overall, the Hawks made only 39 percent from the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''We feel fortunate that we made just enough plays, just enough stops,'' said Atlanta's Mike Budenholzer, recognized before the game for winning the NBA Coach of the Year award.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Squandering an early 12-point lead, the Hawks spent much of the game struggling to put away the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>8 seed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It went down to the wire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Deron Williams missed an open 15-foot jumper that would've tied it with about 10 seconds to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Korver rebounded, was fouled and made two free throws to clinch Atlanta's win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The best-of-seven series shifts to Brooklyn for the next two contests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Game 3 is Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Jarrett Jack led the Nets with 23 points off the bench, and Brook Lopez had 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''All is not lost,'' Jack said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On a night when the Hawks announced an agreement to sell the team to a group led by billionaire businessman Antony Ressler for $850 million, Atlanta got off to another quick start in a repeat of Game 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Horford's jumper made it 27-15 late in the first quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Nets fought back, just as they did in the opener won by the Hawks 99-92.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Brooklyn ripped off 12 straight points in the second period to take its first lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Hawks hardly looked like a team that set a franchise record with 60 wins and finished 22 games ahead of Brooklyn in the East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They missed nine straight shots and turned it over three times before Millsap's layup broke the skid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Even after the Hawks pushed back out to an 11-point lead in the final quarter, Brooklyn wouldn't go away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Jack hit another 3 from the corner to bring the Nets to 90-89.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>After DeMarre Carroll scored his only basket of the night off a slick pass from Millsap, Alan Anderson made a reverse layup off the baseline to again make it a one-point game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Millsap was fouled but made only one of two free throws, giving the Nets a chance to tie it or grab the lead with a 3-pointer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>They couldn't have asked for a better look.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Williams faked a 3 from the corner, sending Kent Bazemore flying by, and stepped up for a shot with no one around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It spun out and was snatched by Korver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Two free throws later, the Hawks finally prevailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>''This ain't no pushover team,'' Millsap said of the Nets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Nets: F Mirza Teletovic played his first game in three months after being treated for multiple blood clots in his lungs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He missed his only two shots while playing just under 4 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>... Joe Johnson scored 19 points, but Brooklyn's other three starters - Williams, Bojan Bogdanovic and Thaddeus Young - combined for only 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Hawks: Carroll had a tough night after scoring 17 points in Game 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He went 0 of 5 from 3-point range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>... Dennis Schroder scored 12 points to lead the reserves, but the remaining backups contributed only 16 points on 5-of-20 shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Ressler, who made an unsuccessful bid for the Los Angeles Clippers last year, leads a group that also includes former NBA star Grant Hill and Spanx founder Sara Blakely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>They still must be approved by the league's owners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>''We are honored and thrilled to have been chosen to become the new stewards of the Hawks,'' said Ressler, who did not attend the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The Nets have dominated the boards, helping them stay close to the Hawks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Brooklyn held a 49-41 edge, led by Williams with 10 rebounds, and leads 96-80 in the series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Atlanta failed to get much help from its guards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Outside of Horford, Carroll (eight rebounds) and Millsap (seven), no one on the Hawks had more than three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>''We've not been great at it all year,'' Horford said.</td></tr>
