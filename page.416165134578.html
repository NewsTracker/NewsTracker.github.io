<h3>Mets reliever Jenrry Mejia suspended for positive drug test (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA (AP) -- New York Mets relief pitcher Jenrry Mejia was suspended 80 games by Major League Baseball on Saturday after testing positive for the performance-enhancing substance Stanozolol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This is the fourth penalty for a positive Stanozolol test reported by MLB in less than a month, following Minnesota pitcher Ervin Santana, Seattle pitcher David Rollins and Atlanta pitcher Arodys Vizcaino.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mejia began the season as New York's closer, but he was placed on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday with posterior elbow inflammation, without having pitched in a game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mejia apologized to the organization, his teammates, fans and family while also maintaining his innocence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''I have been through a lot in my young career and missed time due to injury,'' Mejia said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Mets said in a statement that the team was disappointed when told of the positive test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''We fully support MLB's policy toward eliminating performance enhancing substances from the sport,'' the Mets said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mejia began 2014 as a starter but moved to the closer role about six weeks after Bobby Parnell tore an elbow ligament in the first game of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The right-hander from the Dominican Republic had 28 saves, 18 after the All-Star break to tie for second-most in the NL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Parnell is expected to return next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>New York manager Terry Collins said on Friday that Jeurys Familia is the team's closer for now.</td></tr>
