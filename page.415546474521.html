<h3>Bhutan celebrates after shocking win in World Cup qualifiers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bhutan, ranked 209th by FIFA, defeated the Sri Lankans 2-1 in the capital Thimphu on Tuesday for an aggregate 3-1 victory and a pass to the second round of qualifying beginning in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chencho Gyeltshen, known as the "Ronaldo of Bhutan" in the landlocked Himalayan kingdom, scored both goals in the home victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're totally overwhelmed with the win," Needrup Zangpo, a former editor of Bhutan Observer, told The Associated Press by phone on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The win has helped the Bhutanese people to come together and share the moment of happiness. The result is still being celebrated, talked about in offices and on social media."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Changlimithang National Stadium, a multi-purpose sports facility in the heart of the city, was filled to its capacity of 30,000 for Tuesday's match, with hundreds more waiting outside trying to get in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hopes were high in the country after Bhutan surprised Sri Lanka in the first leg last week in Colombo on a goal from Tshering Dorji.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay gave residents the afternoon off work to watch Tuesday's match and the celebrations continued in the city's markets late into the night.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>Bhutan Football Federation chief Ugen Tsechup Dorji said the team's low ranking was due to lack of matches against other sides and he believed it can build on its success to promote soccer further in the nation of 800,000, where archery is the national sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Even if we play 10 matches and lose all of them our ranking will still go up as there are points for the losing team. But given our limited resources we can't play much international matches," he was quoted as saying by The Bhutanese newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Bhutan team's preparations for the World Cup qualifiers included one month of training in the Thai capital of Bangkok to get used to the heat in Sri Lanka.</td></tr>

<h3>Investors cheer Nintendo move to smartphones</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Japanese video game maker Nintendo Co on Wednesday notched their biggest daily gain since listing as investors cheered the decision by the creators of Super Mario to venture into smartphones in a bid to retain users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the stock's biggest daily gain since Nintendo became public in 1983, adding some $4 billion to the company's market capitalization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nintendo is now worth $24 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Finally, Nintendo has turned a corner and embraced a huge strategic shift," said Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal, who raised his recommendation on the stock to "buy" from "hold" and its price target to 30,000 yen from 12,400 yen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company had so far resisted these calls, pinning hopes on hit games such as "Mario Kart 8".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But in January, it halved its operating earnings target for the current fiscal year to 20 billion yen ($169 million), citing weak 3DS sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The move into smartphone apps could further dent console sales, some analysts said, despite assurances by President Satoru Iwata that Nintendo was committed to making gaming machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nintendo, however, may be shifting away from hardware, with Iwata saying it was developing a new gaming platform, the NX, as well as an online membership service to be launched this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Nintendo is not in a position to simply drop its legacy console businesses given the investments made in software," said CLSA analyst Jay Defibaugh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"But the writing is on the wall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Defibaugh forecast Nintendo to exit the console business in three to five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Before the tie-up with DeNA, Nintendo's shares had fallen over 30 percent in the past four years, lagging a more than doubling in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>DeNA shares, heavily shorted prior to the announcement, also rose on Wednesday limit-up to 1,707 yen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The company, which mainly develops games played on browsers, had also lost market share in the past two years as users moved to mobile apps.</td></tr>
