<h3>Why Germanwings flight might have crashed over the Alps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Germanwings plane that crashed Tuesday in France was at the safest part of flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yet, something went horribly wrong, leading to the death of 150 passengers and crew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The first clue about what could have happened will be the wreckage itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If the debris field is pretty compact, the plane most likely hit the mountains intact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If, it is scattered, the plane probably broke up midair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If you see a wing here and three miles later you see a fuselage, one doesn't have to be an expert to speculate that it didn't happen on the ground - that something happened before it impacted," says Todd Curtis, a former Boeing safety engineer who is now director of the Airsafe.com Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>People comfort each other as they arrive at the Barcelona airport in Spain, Tuesday, March 24, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A Germanwings passenger jet carrying 150 people crashed in the French Alps region as it traveled from Barcelona to Duesseldorf in Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Germanwings Flight 9525 from Barcelona, Spain, to Duesseldorf, Germany, was flown on an Airbus A320, a workhorse of modern aviation, similar to the Boeing 737.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There are over 3,600 of them in operation worldwide, according to Airbus, which also makes nearly identical versions of the plane: The smaller A318 and A319 and the stretched A321.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An additional 2,500 of those jets are flying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The A320 family has a good safety record, with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs, according to a Boeing safety analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This particular jet was delivered to Lufthansa - the parent company of Germanwings - in 1991 and had about 58,300 flight hours over 46,700 flights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is way too early to know for sure what happened, but here are some options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This jet averaged more than 5.3 flights a day over its 24 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That isn't unusual for a plane making short trips around Europe but is on the higher end of what is normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Each takeoff and landing cycle and the pressurization and depressurization associated with it adds stress to the skin of the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Aircraft that fly short, frequent routes go through more of these cycles than planes flying long distances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In 1988, a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines Boeing 737-200 that had made frequent, short hops among the Hawaiian islands lost a large part of its roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Corrosion and metal fatigue were to blame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Flight 9525 reportedly descended at 3,000 feet per minute from its cruising altitude of 38,000, twice the normal speed of a descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If there was some type of rapid decompression - whether from metal fatigue or a bomb - the pilots' first move would be to get the plane down below 10,000 feet, where the air is breathable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The masks that come down from the overhead bins provide about 10 minutes worth of oxygen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>So, a decent rate of 3,000 feet per minute would get the plane down to breathable air just in time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Curtis says that initial rate of decent is consistent with what you would see in a decompression situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Airbus jets have one of the most sophisticated cockpits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>However, there have been issues in the past with some of the instruments there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 started because pilots were getting false air speed indications as it flew through a storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ultimately, pilot error led the plane into a stall but only after they were getting bad data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>More recently, a Lufthansa A321 - the slightly larger version of the A320 - dropped about 4,000 feet in one minute after the autopilot unexpectedly lowered the jet's nose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Following the November incident, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a safety directive warning pilots about the possibility of an error with the angle of attack sensors on the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Pulling up on the jet's sidestick - a device similar to a yoke - would not pull the jet out of the dive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The safety agency noted the only way to stop it was to turn off two of the three air data reference units in the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>These units process the flight speed, up or down angle of the nose, and the altitude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>There is no indication that this crash is tied to any criminal act but such actions can't yet be ruled out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The pilots might have somehow accidently put the plane into a dive or stall and not be able to recover from it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Separately, the pilots could have been so focused on getting the plane below 10,000 feet that they didn't realize how close they were to the mountains until it was too late.</td></tr>
