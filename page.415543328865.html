<h3>Novogen soars on cancer drug milestone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Shares in cancer treatment developer Novogen have soared after it announced that one of its drugs could help destroy a cancer cell's "skeleton".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Novogen says the development of its anti-cancer drug Anisina has reached a major milestone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A proof-of-concept study has shown that Anisina, in combination with other drugs used in chemotherapy, can destroy a cancer cell's cytoskeleton and deliver a powerful anti-cancer effect in animal models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This could lead to a more effective treatment for some cancers and lower dosages of some drugs when treating cancer in children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Its (Anisina's) promise lies in its ability to make the most widely-used chemotherapy drugs work better and safer in more forms of cancer and in more patients," Novogen chief executive Dr Graham Kelly said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Our objective is to see Anisina become one of the most widely used drugs in chemotherapy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shares in Novogen had jumped 3.5 cents, or 20.59 per cent, to 20.5 cents on the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Novogen said the results from the proof-of-concept study represented a crucial step in bringing Anisina towards clinical trials in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The most commonly used drugs used in chemotherapy target the cancer cell's cytoskeleton - the cell's skeletal structure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The drugs, called anti-mitotics, destabilise one of the cytoskeleton's two key components, the microtubules, but leave the other major component, the microfilaments, intact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This incomplete destruction of the cytoskeleton resulted in a low rate of patient response for many tumour types and in a generally short-term response to therapy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Anisina has been developed specifically to destroy the microfilaments and to work in combination with the anti-mitotic drugs to comprehensively destroy the cancer cell's cytoskeleton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Novogen will be looking to use Anisina to boost treatment of cancers such as prostate, ovarian, lung, breast, colorectal and haematological cancers, and cancers such as melanoma where anti-mitotics currently show little benefit.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>HOUSTON (AP) - Authorities on Tuesday carried away two boxes after searching the Houston home of real estate millionaire Robert Durst after his weekend arrest in New Orleans on a murder warrant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Durst, 71, is charged with murder in a killing in California 15 years ago, and has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His arrest in New Orleans came shortly before the finale of an HBO series about his links to the three killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Seven officers spent hours Tuesday searching Durst's home in a 17-story condominium building in a posh Houston neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>About 8:30 p.m. the officers, including one wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge, carried two white cardboard document boxes to six vehicles and left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The officers declined to comment, except for one who confirmed they were done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>FBI spokeswoman Shauna Dunlap confirmed that FBI agents participated in the operation at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Harris County district attorney's office spokesman Jeff McShan said the Los Angeles Police Department contacted his office last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Neither Dunlap nor McShan would elaborate on what was happening inside the building and referred questions to Los Angeles police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>LAPD spokesman Sgt. Barry Montgomery said the department is not commenting until Durst is in its custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Durst is being held in Louisiana, where he faces drug and weapons charges, and it's not clear how soon he will be returned to California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"This is an investigation that's being handled by multi-jurisdictions," Montgomery said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"At this juncture the only thing the LAPD is doing is waiting for the extradition. We are just waiting on him to make it into our custody."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Durst, 71, was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Susan Berman, his confidante and the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster, in Beverly Hills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Dick DeGuerin, Durst's longtime Houston defense attorney, said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condo building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In the documentary "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" that just wrapped up, Durst mumbled about how he "killed them all," providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Analysis linked a letter Durst wrote to Berman a year before her killing with one that pointed police to her body, and that was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Bob Martin, who has lived with his wife, Carol, in the Houston building for 1 years, said he would occasionally say hello to Durst and discuss the real estate market with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He described Durst as no quirkier than anyone else in the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He added that Durst would occasionally attend the building's homeowners' association meetings and that the building staff reported Durst was courteous to them, as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Durst waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him with being a felon in possession of a gun and with having marijuana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Assistant District Mark Burton said investigators found more than a quarter-pound of pot and a revolver in his hotel room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The judge in New Orleans scheduled another hearing for next Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Associated Press writers Tami Abdollah and Brian Melley in Los Angeles, Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans and Emily Wagster in Jackson, Miss., contributed to this report.</td></tr>
