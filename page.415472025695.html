<h3>Cyclone Pam: 'It was like a velociraptor', as Australians survive Vanuatu cyclone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They face long queues, piles of debris and patchy phone reception - but two Australian television producers are thankful they survived Tropical Cyclone Pam in one piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Former Channel 10 morning television director Adam Boland and his partner Kenny Ang were evacuated from their home on Wednesday and took shelter with Boland's mother on the country's main island, Efate, as the worst of the storm hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>So far, eight people are confirmed dead, twenty have serious injuries, and an estimated 10,000 people are homeless in the wake of the category five storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Though gale-force winds battered the home where Mr Ang sheltered in Havannah, uprooting trees and ripping away the gutter, he says he got off lightly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Once the storm had passed, he had one message for his friends on social media: "Alive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It will be a long time until this place is back to normal," Mr Ang posted on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While the worst of the storm lasted for just twelve hours, the cyclone has left a lasting mark on the people and infrastructure of Vanuatu, Mr Ang told Fairfax Media while he queued for petrol on the Kumul Highway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It was quite scary," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Where we were, we didn't even get the worst of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It sounded like a velociraptor shrieking and all we sort of saw was black, things [were] just banging. There's devastation everywhere... we got hit hard, but drive into town and everyone's been hit so much harder," Mr Ang said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As day broke, the pair realised the extent of the damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>To get fuel for cars and generators, they had to swim across a river and get a lift from a friend to join an hours-long queue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Because there's only one ring road around the island of Efate, that was - and is - the only way to get you out of the north of the Island into town, into Port Vila. During the cyclone, that was ripped up and washed away. So we had to swim across that this afternoon to get to my friend's car," Ang said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On the way into Port Vila, they saw villages "decimated" and their occupants sitting in the debris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"A great deal of them have just been demolished," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"You see people on the side of the road just sitting, they don't know what to do now. There is no support. I know the aid agencies are here, but I haven't seen many of them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Australia has pledged $5 million of aid and humanitarian support to the island nation, including fresh water which was flown in by defence force planes on Sunday from Brisbane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Those distributing government and non-government aid have their work cut out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"In town at the moment, the picture I can paint for you is there are roofs and parts of roofs off buildings," Mr Ang said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"A lot of timber, a lot of wood, a lot of trees, power lines are down, everything along the shoreline of Vila Harbour has basically been washed up and demolished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Ang and Mr Boland have tried to get back to their home on the island of Iririki to survey the damage, but access is severely limited after jetties on either side of the island were washed away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It's pretty bad," Mr Ang said, shortly before he had to leave for an area with little to no phone reception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"There are about 20 boats that have been washed up onto the shore of Iririki Island."</td></tr>

<h3>The Fate Of The World's Chocolate Depends On This Spot In Rural England</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Before a cocoa variety from one country can be planted in another, it first makes a pit stop here, at a quarantine center in rural England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Walk into a row of greenhouses in rural Britain, and a late English-winter day transforms to a swampy, humid tropical afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>You could be in Latin America or sub-Saharan Africa, which is exactly how cocoa plants like it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's all right this time of year. It gets a bit hot later on in the summer," says greenhouse technician Heather Lake as she fiddles with a tray of seedlings - a platter of delicate, spindly, baby cocoa plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Since she started working here at the International Cocoa Quarantine Centre, eating chocolate doesn't feel the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You certainly know all the work that goes into producing that chocolate bar, and all the potential threats that could be there in the future," Lake says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Those potential threats are the focus of this research center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Every cocoa tree that travels the world starts with a vacation here in the British countryside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The facility is part of the University of Reading, about 40 miles west of London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And a big chunk of the funding comes from America, via the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The ruler of this little tropical kingdom is a cocoa researcher named Andrew Daymond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He oversees the 400 or so varieties of cocoa in these greenhouses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Asked if he has a favorite, he pauses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There are one or two varieties that have quite interesting-shaped pods on them. This one here, for example, has got a particularly large pod," he says, crouching next to a papaya-shaped fruit the size of a cantaloupe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The pods stick out of the tree trunk like something in a Dr. Seuss illustration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Inside the pods are beans, which are ground into cocoa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Every plant in these greenhouses has some kind of special power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>One might be resistant to a fungus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Another might produce lots of fruit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Cocoa producers all over the world want and need these plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But, there are those potential threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Cocoa is unusually susceptible to disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Every year, a third of the crop is destroyed by fungi and pests with names like "Witches' Broom," "Frosty Pod Rot" and "Vascular-streak dieback."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A few years ago, one of these cocoa diseases hit Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>At the time, "Brazil was one of the world's largest cocoa-producing countries," says Laurent Pipitone of the International Cocoa Organization in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"When this new disease came, it reduced their production by about half."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Green cocoa pods are split open and the beans inside harvested for chocolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>For a while, it looked like there might not be enough cocoa to feed the world's hunger for chocolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Today, global demand is growing fast, says Bill Guyton, president of the World Cocoa Foundation in Washington, D.C. "There's a concern in the future that we may not have enough supply if we don't improve productivity on the existing farms," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Europeans and Americans keep eating piles of chocolate, while people in China and India have a growing appetite for it, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>So all over the world, cocoa researchers are scrambling to come up with more productive, more disease-resistant plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Now imagine that a farm in Ghana produces a super-plant, with pods that contain twice as many beans as a normal cocoa tree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Every chocolate producer in the world would want a cutting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But, if those cuttings contained a fungus or pest currently found only in Ghana, the entire chocolate industry could come crashing down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>That's where the International Quarantine Centre in rural England comes in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"We have to check the plants very carefully during the first few days they're here to make sure that we've not imported any insects," Daymond says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He wanders through the neat rows of cocoa trees, flypaper hanging overhead to make sure nothing unexpected buzzes around the greenhouses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It is an incongruous sight in the middle of rolling English farm country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Which raises the question, why here?</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Daymond says chocolate makers wanted to put this center in a place with weather so dreary, none of those awful cocoa diseases could possibly survive outdoors.</td></tr>
