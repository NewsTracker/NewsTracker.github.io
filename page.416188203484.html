<h3>Big Bend ranchers, landowners will fight planned natural gas pipeline to Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A consortium of two companies owned by billionaire businessmen has won a $767 million contract to build a 143-mile pipeline through mostly private ranch land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rancher Mary Luedeke said talk about condemning something by eminent domain doesn't set well with West Texas landowners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She and about 150 others met for a community meeting on the proposed pipeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I'm here to try and find out where it's going and what their intent is, and to not be painted into a corner by my ignorance," said Luedeke, who is also a justice of the peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"When I come out fighting, I'll know the facts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The pipeline would deliver up to 1.4 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from the Permian Basin for Mexican Federal Electricity Commission's power generation and industrial use, according to a story in the San Antonio Express-News (http://bit.ly/1D9xak2).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The pipeline would run south between Alpine and Marfa toward Presidio, and connect with a large pipeline on the Mexican side near Ojinaga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There currently are no energy transmission pipelines in the Big Bend region, or any oil or gas production.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lisa Dillinger, a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners, one of the two companies, said construction is expected to begin later this year or early in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The two companies are Carso, owned by Carlos Slim, the richest man in Mexico, and Energy Transfer, led by CEO Kelcy Warren, who Forbes says is worth $6.7 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Energy Transfer said in a fact sheet released recently that the pipeline will provide millions of dollars of financial benefits to local communities in construction jobs, goods and services and taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Landowners will be compensated for easements along the pipeline, which will follow existing power lines and railroads where feasible, according to the sheet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Big Bend region holds vast state and national parks, high peaks and scenic river canyons, pronghorns by the roadside, and a rich cultural history that includes ghost towns and real Texas cowboys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Not everyone in the Big Bend area is opposed to the pipeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In Presidio, along the Mexican border, the project looks alluring, the city's economic director said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We're hoping to get a feeder line off of it and run it into town. We have no natural gas in Presidio," Brad Newton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We have propane tanks in everyone's backyard. It's inconvenient. It's expensive and people can run out."</td></tr>
