<h3>Inbee Park wins third straight Women's PGA Championship (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>HARRISON, N.Y. (AP) -- Inbee Park won her third consecutive Women's PGA Championship on Sunday - and accomplished a whole lot more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Park also regained the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1 ranking in the word, surpassed idol Se Ri Pak for the most majors by a South Korean player with six, tied the LPGA Tour record for the lowest score in a major in relation to par at 19 under and, in her own mind, cemented a place in women's golf history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''Obviously, putting my name alongside like Annika Sorenstam or Patty Berg, legends of golf, just being a part of history of this golf tournament, I feel extremely honored, and I can't believe that I just did it,'' Park said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 26-year-old Park closed with a bogey-free 5-under 68 at Westchester Country Club, finishing the season's second major five strokes ahead of 22-year-old compatriot Sei Young Kim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Park had 22 birdies and only three bogeys in 72 holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I played great the last three days,'' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''I couldn't believe myself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Park and Sorenstam (2003-2005) are only players to win the event previously called the LPGA Championship three consecutive years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It also was Park's fifth victory in the last 12 majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Park won the previous two years in playoffs in Pittsford, New York, taking the 2013 event at Locust Hill and the 2014 tournament at Monroe Golf Club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Park birdied the par-5 final hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was her 56th consecutive hole without a bogey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kim, a two-time winner this season as a rookie, started the day two strokes back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She bogeyed the third and the fourth holes, then reeled off four consecutive birdies, holing a long putt on the eighth to pull within a shot of the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A three-stroke swing on the ninth hole put Park in charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She made a birdie putt, then watched as Kim three-putted for double bogey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Kim finished with a 71.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''Everything fell apart at the ninth hole,'' Kim said through an interpreter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lexi Thompson was third at 12 under after a 66.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She had eight birdies on her first 13 holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Thompson pulled within two strokes with her birdie on the 13th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But she missed a chance on the par-5 15th hole, hitting her tee shot well right and scrambled to make par.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She then bogeyed the 16th to end her chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''(I) just take a lot of positives from it knowing that I can pull off a round on Sunday here,'' Thompson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Brittany Lincicome, the winner of the first major of the year at the ANA Inspiration, finished fourth at 11 under.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She birdied the final hole for a 68.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Seventeen-year-old Canadian Brooke Henderson tied for fifth with Morgan Pressel at 10 under.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Her $132,725 check will help in Henderson's bid to earn a tour card for next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>She needs to either win a tournament or finish with the equivalent of the 40th player on the money list to avoid qualifying school after being denied an age exemption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The shot of the day came from Hyo Joo Kim with a hole-in-one on the 149-yard 14th hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>She finished with a 71 to tie for ninth at 8 under.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>With No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>1 Lydia Ko missing the cut for the first time in 54 tries, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>2 Park needed to finish just 29th or better to retake the top spot she last held in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It will be her third stay at the top of the rankings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>She was to the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>1 for 59 weeks in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Park earned $525,000 for her third LPGA Tour victory of the season and 15th overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>She joined Sorenstam, Pak, Patty Sheehan, Nancy Lopez, Kathy Whitworth and Mickey Wright as the only players to win the event at least three times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Wright won it four times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>''I think I always dreamed myself being a part of history, leaving my name, even before I die, there is my name on this trophy'' Park said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>''There's a name on the U.S. Open trophy.</td></tr>
