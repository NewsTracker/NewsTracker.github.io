<h3>Microsoft books $8.4 billion write-down on phones in 4Q</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Microsoft booked an $8.4 billion charge in the fourth quarter, swallowing a bitter pill by writing off the Nokia phone business it bought just over a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It narrowly beat analysts' depressed expectations for a quarter that also saw a steep decline in personal computer sales even as it prepares to launch its latest operating system, Windows 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Redmond, Washington-based software giant posted a net loss of $3.20 billion, or 40 cents per share, reversing a profit of $4.61 billion, or 55 cents per share, a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Adjusted to exclude the charges, the company posted a quarterly profit of 62 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research of 31 cents per share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The write-down was expected after CEO Satya Nadella announced 7,800 job cuts two weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company will continue to make phones on a smaller scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The difficult quarter comes ahead of the launch of Windows 10 on July 29, a free upgrade for users of Windows 7 or 8 for the next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The company hopes that better integrating its store into the revamped Start button and powering more Internet searches through Bing will compensate for the temporary dip in Windows revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the quarter through June, Windows revenue fell 22 percent, hurt by a decline in PC shipments that researchers at IDC pegged at 11.8 percent globally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The decline was exacerbated by a temporary bump last year when Microsoft ended support for Windows XP, which resulted in a one-time boost to Windows 7 sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Offsetting some of the decline was its booming cloud computing business and positive contributions from Xbox, Surface tablets and Bing search ads, which gained more than a percentage point for a U.S. market share of 20.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Phone hardware sales were worse than expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Overall revenue fell 5 percent to $22.18 billion, slightly higher than the $21.98 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Zacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Shares dipped $1.73, or 3.7 percent, to $45.55 in after-hours trading, down nearly 2 percent since the start of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.</td></tr>
