<h3>Google embeds engineers as professors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google software engineer and Google In Residence Sabrina Williams, center, talks with students including freshman Alanna Walton, left, during a Google Student Development class on Impostor Syndrome, at Howard University in Washington, Tuesday, April 14, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In ongoing efforts to diversify Silicon Valley's tech sector, Google is embedding engineers at a handful of Historically Black Colleges and Universities where they teach, mentor and advise on curriculum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google software engineer and Google In Residence Sabrina Williams, right, talks with students including, from left, freshmen Lucretia Williams, Alanna Walton, and Christopher Hocutt, during a Google Student Development class on Impostor Syndrome at Howard University in Washington, Tuesday, April 14, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Howard University freshman Alanna Walton knew something was different about the professor teaching her introduction to computer science course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>First, there was her name: Professor Sabrina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She was an African American woman, kept office hours until 2 a.m. if that's what it took to see everyone, and had an additional title: Google In Residence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It was an awesome class," said Alanna who has already chosen her major at the Washington D.C.-based university: computer science.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Today 35 percent of African Americans receiving computer science degrees come from those schools, but they don't make their way to Silicon Valley's top tech firms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Google is typical - about 1 percent of its technical staffers are black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Last year a push by civil rights advocate Jesse Jackson prompted several dozen tech firms to release workforce diversity data which showed under-representation of African Americans, Latinos and women in the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In response, businesses, universities and community leaders have launched initiatives aimed at diversifying their ranks, both ethnically and by gender.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Anita Borg Institute and the National Center for Women and Information Technology have partnered with many companies to support female engineers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Facebook offers "Facebook University," an internship for low income minority college freshmen interested in computer science.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Intel has committed $300 million over the next five years toward diversifying its workforce, while Apple has a $50 million partnership with nonprofits to support women and minority computer science majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Google decided to go to the source, sending a handful of software engineers to teach at Howard, Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia, Fisk University in Nashville, and Spelman and Morehouse colleges in Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They taught introductory courses, but they also trained students on everything from how to send a professional email to how to make it through a software engineering job interview, which can involve a lot of time solving coding questions at a white board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This summer, 30 of those students will be Google interns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And Howard University graduating senior Christopher Hocutt, 21, whose friends jokingly call him Mr. Google, will be starting at the company full-time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Hocutt said the Google In Residence professors convinced him to apply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"What they discovered was a lot of people weren't even applying to Google because we didn't believe we were skilled enough to do it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Once we realized we have the skills, we just needed mentorship to make our resume look good, get through the interview, have confidence to try."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Google software engineer Sabrina Williams, who took a semester away from her Mountain View campus this year to mentor and teach at Howard, is thrilled to see her student becoming a colleague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I'm inspired," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Change is slow, this is going to take time, but I think what's interesting about this program is that it's a different way of attacking the problem of lack of diversity in tech."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Fifteen years ago, Williams was the only female African American computer science major at Stanford University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I kind of felt awkward so I kind of hid a lot," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"It was very difficult."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>She said that while "teaching is hard" and the hours at Howard were grueling, she welcomed the opportunity to offer students an experience different from her own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>This included taking female computer scientists aside early in the semester, telling them she was available for any questions, and encouraging them to support each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Legrand Burge, who chairs Howard University's computer science department, welcomes the temporary addition of Google engineers to his faculty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"They're not academics but they have domain expertise that students could definitely learn a lot from," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The word got out and it actually got a lot of students interested in computer science who didn't initially plan to study it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Indeed, class sizes have doubled in intro courses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Williams had 70 students in one class; about 250 were taught so far this year by Google engineers at all five schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In the 1970s and 80s a similar program partnered the university with AT&T, Bell and Hewlett Packard, Burge said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>This time, he said, Google is bringing a disruptive, Silicon Valley mentality to their campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"The issue with the East Coast and West Coast ecosystem, is that in the West there's a fail fast, fail often mentality," Burge said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"And there's a disconnect between academia, which does not have that try things out, dare to experiment, fail and learn about why you failed, come back and do better, culture."</td></tr>
