<h3>Pixar celebrates Cannes return with original 'Inside Out'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>From left, Mindy Kaling, Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith pose for photographers during a photo call for the film Inside Out, at the 68th international film festival, Cannes, southern France, Monday, May 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After a two-year hiatus, Pixar has made a sensational return to the Cannes Film Festival with "Inside Out," the kind of fresh take on animation that the studio built itself on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Inside Out" premiered Monday at Cannes and was among the most enthusiastically received films of the festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Because Pixar delayed its planned 2014 release, "Good Dinosaur," it was the Disney studio's first new film since 2013's "Monsters University" and first non-sequel since 2012's "Brave."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Inside Out" is a Pixar-styled "Inception" where the story unfolds both in reality and in the mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It partly take place inside the head of an 11-year-old girl, where voices like Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith) and Anger (Lewis Black) compete for the girl's emotions and memories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The high concept is sometimes rather abstract, but nevertheless packs an emotional wallop that left many teary-eyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The story is by Pete Docter, who also co-directs, and it contains some of the tenderness of his 2009 Pixar release "Up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Hollywood Reporter said it "ingeniously personifies the furiously erupting sensations associated with the onset of adolescence as a bunch of emotionally competitive cartoon characters."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Variety wrote that although "Inside Out" sounds like "another lunatic gamble," it proves to be "the greatest idea the toon studio has ever had."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Such a strong response was much needed for Pixar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Although the animation studio had an unparalleled run of critical and box-office successes with the "Toy Story" films, "Wall-E," "Up" and "Ratatouille," doubt in Pixar's ability to sustain its nearly unblemished record began to creep in after the less well-reviewed "Brave" and the studio's increasing output of sequels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Inside Out," which Disney will release on June 19, is Pixar's second original film in a row to feature a female protagonist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's very important for us, both at Pixar and at Disney, of having female and ethnic characters - protagonists and all through," said John Lasseter, Pixar's chief creative officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"You'll see in future films we really are paying attention to that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The reception to "Inside Out" was so good that some at Cannes wondered whether it should have been included in the festival's prestigious Palme d'Or competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Poehler quixotically hoped for the impossible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's not up for the ... what do you call it?" said Poehler, referring to Cannes' top film honor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"But it could still win, right?"</td></tr>
