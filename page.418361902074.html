<h3>Dempsey scores twice, US beats Honduras 2-1 to open Gold Cup (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FRISCO, Texas (AP) -- Clint Dempsey didn't view a wild sellout crowd as a pro-Texas bunch celebrating two goals by what amounts to a hometown kid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The East Texas native thinks American soccer supporters are a lot more fervent than that now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dempsey scored twice on headers not far from where he trained as a youth, and the United States opened defense of its CONCACAF Gold Cup title with a 2-1 victory over Honduras on Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I think the crowd was behind the whole team,'' said the 32-year-old, who is up to 43 international goals, 14 behind Landon Donovan's American record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''I remember when I first started with the national team and they'd be more fans for the other team sometimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dempsey's goals in the 25th and 64th minutes were created from crosses from Michael Bradley, wearing the captain's arm band in his 100th international appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The goals oosted the Americans to 13-0 in Gold Cup openers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Carlos Discua scored his first international goal in the 69th minute for Honduras, a semifinalist in the last three Gold Cups, and the Catrachos came close to tying the score.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''It wasn't our best performance, but we're happy to get three points from our first game,'' Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It was the first competitive match for the U.S. since losing to Belgium in overtime in the second round of last year's World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Americans, 29-1-2 in Gold Cup group play, meet Haiti on Friday and Panama on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Haiti tied Panama 1-1 in the doubleheader opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>U.S. goalkeeper Brad Guzan had a couple of tough saves in the first few minutes on a muggy night before 22,357 at the home of Major League Soccer's FC Dallas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''They came out and put us under a bit of pressure and we had to find a way to weather that storm, which we did,'' Guzan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''I don't think we were at our best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The first U.S. goal developed when DeAndre Yedlin played a short corner kick to Bradley, who crossed on a bounce to the far post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Henry Figueroa's clearance attempt back to Bradley's side was picked up at the side of the 6-yard box by Jozy Altidore, who took a touch and shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Goalkeeper Donis Escobar kicked the ball out with his right foot and it popped up to Dempsey, who nodded it in from 6 yards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Bradley's free kick from the flank led to the second goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Escobar stayed on his line and an unmarked Dempsey jumped 4 yards out and headed inside the far post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After a sluggish start, the U.S. controlled the pace in the second half until Discua took a nifty pass from Wilmer Crisanto and touched the ball past a standing Ventura Alvarado before beating Guzan over the keeper's left shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Alvarado, who also had been eligible to play for Mexico, played his first competitive match for the U.S. and became tied to the American national team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Honduras had a couple of good opportunities in the final 20 minutes, including when Guzan knocked a ball toward Eddie Hernandez, who had an open net but couldn't control the ball before it went out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''I feel like we played a good match,'' said Honduras coach Jorge Luis Pinto, who led Costa Rica to the quarterfinals at the World Cup in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''But in football, sometimes the small details are what determine the matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Bradley, a son of former U.S. coach Bob Bradley, became the 16th American male to make 100 international appearances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>At 27 years, 341 days, he is the fourth-youngest American after Donovan (26-96), Cobi Jones (27-239) and Marcelo Balboa (27-320).</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''Great atmosphere and a very special moment for Michael Bradley,'' U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Bradley replaced Dempsey, who lost the captaincy going into the Gold Cup after getting suspended by MLS and the U.S. Soccer Federation for a confrontation with a referee in a U.S. Open Cup match for Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Those questions persist for Klinsmann, who considers them more irrelevant each day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''As a striker, what do you want to do the most is scoring,'' said Klinsmann, tied for fourth on Germany's career scoring list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>If the U.S. wins the Gold Cup, it would qualify for the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>If another nation wins, it would meet the Americans in a playoff for the Confederations Cup berth.</td></tr>
