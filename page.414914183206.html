<h3>Tentative contract reached in West Coast ports dispute</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The volume of cargo that West Coast dockworkers and their employers must clear, now that they've reached a tentative contract agreement Friday evening, is staggering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Put in a line, the containers would stretch 579 miles (930 kilometers).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Stacked up, they'd rise nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers)" about the orbiting altitude of the International Space Station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And those are just the ships waiting for dock space at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There are smaller, though substantial, backups in San Francisco Bay and Washington's Puget Sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Port of Oakland reckoned it would take up to eight weeks to recover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In recent weeks, companies that operate marine terminals cut night, weekend and holiday shifts " saying they did not want to pay overtime for what amounted to a "strike with pay." That was a reference to what they said was a worker slowdown that began in November. The union said longshoremen were abiding by all safety rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was the kind of brinksmanship familiar from past negotiations between two sides with a history of conflict that dates to the killing of striking dockworkers during the Great Depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While the ports never shut down fully, the problems in the supply chain were acute " and growing. All told, West Coast ports handle about $1 trillion worth of cargo annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The contract deal will, eventually, restore the free flow of cargo across docks at 29 seaports that handle about one-quarter of U.S. international trade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>U.S. exports, particularly from farms, also are waiting to reach Asian markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Seroka wants to prioritize ships serving U.S. military bases on the Pacific Rim or carrying perishables such as produce, autos or goods for major retailers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The sense of urgency in the industry right now is as good as I've ever seen it," Seroka said of both sides' willingness to speed cargo into the stream of commerce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The tentative contract still must be approved by the 13,000-member International Longshore and Warehouse Union's rank-and-file, as well as the full Pacific Maritime Association of employers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A vote by union members could come in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was not immediately clear when employers would vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Neither side released details, but in a recent letter, maritime association President James McKenna outlined what he called employers' "last, best and final" offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It included maintenance of nearly no-cost health coverage, an $11,000 increase in the maximum pension benefit to $91,000, and a $1-per-hour wage increase over each of the five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Though dockworker wages vary by job and skill level, the average exceeds $50 per hour, according to the maritime association, which represents ocean-going shipping lines and the companies that load and unload cargo at port terminals.</td></tr>

<h3>News24.com | White House tries to counter Netanyahu visit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There are limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Administration officials have discarded the idea of President Barack Obama himself giving an Iran-related address to rebut the two speeches Netanyahu is to deliver during his early March visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But other options remain on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Among them: a presidential interview with a prominent journalist known for coverage of the rift between Obama and Netanyahu, multiple Sunday show television appearances by senior national security aides and a pointed snub of America's leading pro-Israel lobby, which is holding its annual meeting while Netanyahu is in Washington, according to the officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The administration has already ruled out meetings between Netanyahu and Obama, saying it would be inappropriate for the two to meet so close to Israel's 17 March elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the White House is now doubling down on a cold-shoulder strategy, including dispatching Cabinet members out of the country and sending a lower-ranking official than normal to represent the administration at the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Vice President Joe Biden will be away, his absence behind Netanyahu conspicuous in coverage of the speech to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other options were described by officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss internal deliberations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Netanyahu's plan for a 3 March address to a joint meeting of Congress has further strained already tense ties between the US and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Congressional Republicans orchestrated Netanyahu's visit without consulting the White House or State Department, a move the Obama administration blasted as a break in diplomatic protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some Democratic lawmakers say they will boycott the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>US officials believe Netanyahu's trip to Washington is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, Obama's signature foreign policy objective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While Netanyahu has long been sceptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions that would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His opposition has intensified as negotiations go into overdrive with an end-of-March deadline for a framework deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I think this is a bad agreement that is dangerous for the state of Israel, and not just for it," Netanyahu said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The difference of opinion over the deal has become unusually rancorous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The White House and State Department have both publicly accused Israeli officials of leaking "cherry-picked" details of the negotiations to try to discredit the administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And, in extraordinary admissions this week, the administration acknowledged that the U.S. is withholding sensitive details of the talks from Israel, its main Middle East ally, to prevent such leaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The rebukes have only emboldened the leader of Israel, whose country Iran has threatened to annihilate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He has a double-barrel attack on the Iran talks ready for when he arrives in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Not only will he address Congress, he will also deliver similar remarks at the AIPAC conference, an event to which administrations past and present have traditionally sent top foreign policy officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>An AIPAC official said Friday that the group has not yet received any reply to its invitation for senior administration figures to attend the meeting that starts March 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The official stressed that last-minute RSVPs are not unusual, but the White House has been signalling for some time that a Cabinet-level guest may not coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Instead, the administration is toying with the idea of sending newly installed Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken to speak to the conference, according to officials familiar with internal discussions on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But it's possible Treasury Secretary Jack Lew could attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, who have both previously addressed AIPAC, will be out of the country on foreign travel that appears to have been arranged to make them unavailable to speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Biden will be visiting Uruguay and Guatemala on a trip that was announced after Netanyahu's speech was scheduled, while the State Department announced abruptly this week that Kerry will be traveling to as-yet-determined destinations for the duration of the AIPAC conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Obama spoke to AIPAC in 2012, while he was in the midst of his re-election campaign.</td></tr>
