<h3>Islamic State Fighters Clash With Tripoli-Based Faction In Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Libya has been wracked by conflict since the 2011 armed uprising, with two governments and powerful militias battling for control of key cities and the North African country's oil riches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>TRIPOLI, March 14 (Reuters) - Clashes erupted in central Libya on Saturday between Islamic State fighters and a force loyal to a Tripoli-based faction, a military official and residents said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Islamic State, the militant group which has seized much of Iraq and Syria, has expanded in Libya in recent months, helped by the chaos and lawlessness of a fight for control between two rival governments and their respective allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Local supporters of the militants executed a group of Egyptian Christians and have claimed attacks on a luxury hotel, foreign missions and police stations in the capital Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Saturday, Islamic State militants clashed with the al-Shorooq force allied to a Tripoli-based government that was established by the armed faction Libya Dawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Libya Dawn seized the capital in August, forcing the internationally recognized government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni to operate from the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Clashes between Shorooq forces ... and a terrorist group calling itself Islamic State have killed one and wounded two from Shorooq forces," Shorooq spokesman Ismail Shukri said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Residents confirmed the fighting, some 60 km east of Sirte, a major city where Islamic State have taken over government buildings, a university and a radio station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The clashes started when a report arrived that the terrorist group had set up a checkpoint at a coastal road and started inspecting motorists," Shukri said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Shorooq forces went to the location to see what was going on but they were attacked by the terrorist fighters," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The region east of Sirte has been a battlefield since December when Shorooq forces moved in to try seize Libya's two biggest oil ports, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, which are held by forces loyal to Thinni's government.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Western powers and Libya's neighbors worry that if the OPEC member is divided up between two governments, Islamic State and other local armed groups could carve out fiefdoms.</td></tr>
