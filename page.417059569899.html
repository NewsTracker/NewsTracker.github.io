<h3>Egypt hangs six convicted militants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The six men, who were hanged, were accused of being members of militant group Sinai Province, which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They were found guilty of killing of two officers during a gunfight in March 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, rights groups had called for a retrial for the six men, arguing that the court process was flawed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said that three of the men were in custody at that time, and could not have carried out the attack in Arab Sharkas, a village north of Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Amnesty described the men's trial as "grossly unfair" and said the men said they were tortured into confessing to the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Sinai Province group has carried out a series of attacks against military targets in Egypt's Sinai peninsula since the army ousted President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The group was previously called Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Champions of Jerusalem), but announced a name change in November 2014 after pledging allegiance to IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The execution comes a day after a court handed down death sentences to Mr Morsi and more than 100 other people, over a mass prison break in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Shortly after the ruling, gunmen shot dead four people, including three judges, in the northern Sinai city of al-Arish.</td></tr>
