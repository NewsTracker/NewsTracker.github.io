<h3>Police: Maryland shootings suspect arrested near 1st scene</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A man accused of firing at five public places in Maryland, including a building at the National Security Agency, chose his targets at random, police said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Anne Arundel County Chief Timothy Altomare said the shootings over the past week evoked memories of two snipers who killed 10 people in 2002 in the Washington area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Despite the fear created by the latest shootings, Altomare said everyone is "alive and well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Most of us here probably, in some way, shape or form, are aware of the events 15 years ago with the D.C. sniper case," Altomare said at a news conference with officers from the FBI and Howard and Prince George's counties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"As soon as we started to hear about the possibility of this stuff being linked, we kicked every effort we had into overdrive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That spurred a large-scale manhunt that ended Tuesday in the capture of Hong Young, 35, of Beltsville.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was charged with attempted murder and assault in the first shooting Feb. 24 near Arundel Mills mall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Police said the other shootings were linked by ballistic evidence or surveillance video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prince George's County Police searched Young's two-story, red-brick home Wednesday and said they found ten weapons, including several handguns, a cross bow, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Anne Arundel police spokesman T.J. Smith said Young was being monitored at a local hospital and was under police guard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Two Anne Arundel officers took him into custody after spotting a 1999 Lincoln Town Car seen near the site of the first shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Smith said stores were closed, so the vehicle's presence was suspicious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The officers approached the car and saw shell casings and a handgun inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Investigators later matched the casings and a .380 semi-automatic handgun to last week's shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One person was hurt by broken glass from a vehicle window in that case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Another person was similarly injured Tuesday in a shooting along a busy highway in Prince George's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>No one was hurt Tuesday in the NSA shooting or in Monday's shootings outside at Walmart in Laurel and a movie theater in Columbia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The sites are within a 12-mile radius in the Baltimore-Washington area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Clearly, he was continuing to do it until he got caught," Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"This guy apparently has some other issues going on (that) our detectives continue to follow up on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Smith declined to give details, citing health privacy laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Smith said he was taken into custody without incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Young filed for divorce in September after nearly seven years of marriage, but the case was dismissed Monday because his wife had not been served with documents in the case, according to court records in Prince George's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Secretary Stephen Moyer said Young was a prison guard from January 2012 to May 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"There was nothing significant about his employment," Moyer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"He was assigned to one of the medium (security) facilities in Jessup. He resigned. There was nothing remarkable about his file."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Smith said investigators were working to determine a motive, but did not believe the shootings were terrorism.</td></tr>

<h3>Mexico captures Zetas drug cartel boss in second kingpin arrest in a week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Trevino, brother of captured ex-Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevino, was caught by members of the army and the federal police in the northern city of Monterrey in the early hours of Wednesday, a senior government official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His arrest comes just days after the capture of Servando Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug gang.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Mexican government had offered a 30m peso ($2m) reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The US Drug Enforcement Administration had offered a $5m reward for his capture, saying he was wanted on drug-trafficking charges, but listed "Omar" as an alias and his given name as Alejandro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano "El Lazca".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Zetas carved a path of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among the grimmest incidents pinned on the Zetas are the massacres of dozens of migrant workers, an arson attack on a Monterrey casino in 2011 that killed 52 and the dumping of 49 decapitated bodies near the same city in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Founded by army deserters in the late 1990s, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, based along the border with Texas and one of the oldest organized crime groups in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the group struck out on its own in early 2010, setting off the most violent phase in Mexico's drug war.</td></tr>
