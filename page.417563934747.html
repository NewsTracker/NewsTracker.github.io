<h3>FAI release detailed statement explaining ?5m payment from FIFA in wake of Thierry Henry handball to show they acted legally</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The FAI have released a statement detailing the circumstances of the 5million payment they received from FIFA in the wake of Thierry Henry's infamous handball that cost the Republic a place at the 2010 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The association said on Friday night that because the payment had been confirmed by FIFA they were no longer bound by the confidentiality agreement made with football's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And the FAI, in a detailed statement, have demonstrated that they 'acted at all times in the best interests of Irish football, and in full compliance with Irish company law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This action is being taken because FIFA has confirmed the transaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As such, it is the view of the FAI Board who met today, that they are no longer obliged to abide by the confidentiality agreement with FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This is also being done to demonstrate that the Board of the Association acted at all times in the best interests of Irish football, and in full compliance with Irish company law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The FAI also produced a copy of the agreement with FIFA on their official website as well as a bank transaction displaying the payment to their account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The arbitrary payment - around 3.6m - was made after Delaney complained about Blatter making public a confidential meeting with an Irish delegation who were chasing compensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Blatter ridiculed the Irish for wanting a 33rd wildcard spot in South Africa, after Henry's deliberate handball set up France's decisive goal in the play-off second leg in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nevertheless, FIFA agreed the pay-out to head off legal action by the Irish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While Delaney did not specify the sum, he told RTE Radio 1: 'We felt we had a legal case against FIFA because of the Henry handball; also the way Blatter behaved, having a snigger and laugh at us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'I told him how I felt about him, there were some expletives used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>We came to an agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's a very good and legitimate agreement for the FAI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I'm bound by confidentiality from naming that figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>You've put a figure out there and fair play to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The FAI say the money was fully accounted for and spent on building the Aviva Stadium, where they play England in a friendly on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>FIFA admit they paid the money to avoid legal action but claim it was a loan towards construction costs that was waived after Ireland failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But Jim Boyce, who stepped down as Britain's FIFA vice-president last week, said there should be a full investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'Further to FIFA's statement in relation to the 5m settlement with the FAI, the Association can now confirm that a legal settlement agreement was reached with FIFA following the threat of a legal case by the Association against world governing body in early 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'The matter has been reported before in the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>However, the Association has, until now, abided by the confidentiality agreement required by FIFA as part of the settlement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'The settlement was reached following strong legal advice given to the Association regarding the case against FIFA, and was a legitimate payment that enabled the Association to put 5m into the Aviva stadium project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This is fully reflected in our financial statements which are audited independently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'The Association accepted FIFA's settlement offer to avoid a long, costly and protracted legal case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The offer given to the Association was fully written off by FIFA in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>'FIFA's settlement has at no time influenced FAI criticism of FIFA as demonstrated by our consistent criticisms of Sepp Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'On 18 November 2009, there was a play-off match between France and the Republic of Ireland for a place in the 2010 World Cup finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>'During the match, a handball by France's Thierry Henry led indirectly to a goal against the Irish team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>'Ireland did not qualify for the World Cup finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>'While the Referee's decision is final, and the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) ultimately accepted it as such, in January 2010 FIFA entered into an agreement with FAI in order to put to an end any claims against FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>'FIFA granted FAI a loan of $5 million for the construction of a stadium in Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'At the same time, UEFA also granted the FAI funds for the same stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>'The terms agreed between FIFA and the FAI were that the loan would be reimbursed if Ireland qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>'Ireland did not so qualify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Boyce, from Northern Ireland, said: 'I have never heard anything as ridiculous in my life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Meanwhile, Jack Warner, one of Blatter's closest aides for over 20 years, pledged to release an 'avalanche' of evidence relating to FIFA's financial transactions - including the president's dealings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Warner, who is on bail in Trinidad facing US Department of Justice corruption charges, said: 'I fear for my life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>At the age of 73 I have no intention of allowing them to deprive me of my freedom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>I will no longer keep secrets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>'I have compiled a comprehensive series of documents, including cheques and corroborated statements and I have placed them in respected hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>These documents also deal with my knowledge of certain transactions at FIFA including but not limited to its president Sepp Blatter.</td></tr>
