<h3>Blatter disgraced FIFA, says former vice-president</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>No one brought more shame on FIFA than its president Sepp Blatter and he should step aside for a younger leader, the organisation's former vice-president Jack Warner has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Warner, who has been accused of soliciting bribes as part of a US-led corruption case against senior FIFA officials, left jail in Trinidad and Tobago on Thursday after he was granted bail, according to local media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Why are there no investigations in Asia, or in Europe?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Warner told German magazine Stern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Why are there no investigations into Sepp Blatter?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Why are there no investigations into Sepp Blatter? No other person has brought so much shame and disgrace on FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Warner is among nine FIFA officials and five corporate executives charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with running a criminal enterprise that involved more than $150m in bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I only know this: he was elected FIFA boss five times in succession. Is he corrupt? I don't know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If I were his age... I'd retire and pass the presidency of FIFA on to someone younger. But everyone has different ideas of what to do with their lives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Once one of the most powerful men in FIFA, Warner surrendered to authorities on Wednesday after US officials sought his extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Prosecutors say Warner solicited bribes worth $10m from the South African government for them to host the 2010 World Cup and diverted bribes for personal use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>South Africa, meanwhile, have confirmed a payment was made but denied it was a bribe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Warner issued a statement protesting his innocence on Wednesday as FIFA reeled from police raids in Switzerland and the U.S. and a second investigation opened by the Swiss authorities into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Warner, who faces 12 charges, including racketeering and bribery, said on Wednesday he was innocent and noted he had left football activities four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The 72-year-old resigned from FIFA after ethics investigations were begun into a meeting he held with former Asian Football Confederation chief Mohammed Bin Hammam where payments were made to Caribbean soccer officials ahead of the election for FIFA president in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A defiant Blatter, who won his fifth term as FIFA president on Friday, has come out fighting against allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>FIFA: Culprit or victim?</td></tr>
