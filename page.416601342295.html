<h3>Greece's finance minister attacked by anarchists but unhurt while dining in central Athens</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - Greece's outspoken finance minister says he and his wife came under attack by anarchists while dining in a central Athens restaurant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yanis Varoufakis said Wednesday he and his wife were in the Exarhia district, a neighborhood popular with extreme leftists and anarchists, Tuesday night when a group barged into the restaurant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The group, who had their faces covered, demanded the minister leave the area and threw glass objects at the couple, Varoufakis said, without either of them being hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said that when some of the group moved in a threatening manner against him, his wife embraced him so that the potential attackers could not get at him without hitting her first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Varoufakis eventually spoke with the group outside the restaurant, he said, and tempers were calmed.</td></tr>
