<h3>US boosting ?anti-propaganda? budget, mulling ?increase of lethality? for Ukraine support ? Nuland</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"We have, over the last 14 months, provided $118 million in security assistance" to the authorities in Kiev, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland told the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In addition to training, the aid included high-end defensive systems such as artillery radars and communications equipment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"All 28 NATO allies have provided some form of security assistance to Ukraine," said Nuland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While visiting Hungary in mid-February, Russian president Vladimir Putin told reporters that the West had been supplying Kiev with weapons, but that he was still optimistic about the ceasefire agreed at Minsk days earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the time, the claim was rejected as "incorrect" by State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to Nuland, however, the US is "giving a significant amount of nonlethal security support, defensive weapons, to the Ukrainians. The issue is whether to increase the lethality, the issue is the kinds of systems."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Asked whether Washington might rather send Ukraine money to buy weapons, Nuland said the government in Kiev has had "a lot of difficulty" getting countries to sell it weapons "in the absence of the US providing" them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She could not, however, say whether or when the White House may decide to send weapons to Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile, the US has been ramping up its information campaign which Nuland says is aimed at "countering lies with truth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Washington will spend over $23 million on Russian-language programming in 2015 - an increase of 49 percent from last year, and over 100 percent from 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In addition, the Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia spoke of her requests for "more than $20 million in foreign assistance and public diplomacy funds."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This would involve "training" for Russian-speaking journalists, "support" for civil society watchdogs and independent media, and "exchange programs" for students and entrepreneurs, among other things, Nuland explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At the same time, Nuland alleged Russia was using "nefarious, dirty money" to fund "false NGOs" in Europe and financing political candidates "out of Kremlin coffers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nuland tried to have it both ways, claiming in her prepared remarks that the "Kremlin's pervasive propaganda campaign" was "poisoning across Europe", but alleging the existence of a "strong public backlash" in Europe against Russian media, and in the US against RT, "because people want truth, not Kremlin fabrication."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The US' truthful information campaign efforts seem to have had some effect - particularly in the Capitol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Congressman Eliot Engel (D-NY) recently referenced a recent Radio Free Europe story, and cited as fact the unsubstantiated claim by US Army General Ben Hodges that 12,000 Russian troops were allegedly present in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And RFE is just a small part of the international broadcast service of the US government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The US assistant secretary did not bother to back her sweeping statements and strong rhetoric against Russia with much evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At one point she even seemed to have thrown her own piece of propaganda by gluing together various statements in one very long sentence, apparently designed to create the feeling that Russia was to blame for everything happening in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"In eastern Ukraine, Russia and its separatist puppets have unleashed unspeakable violence and pillage; hundreds and hundreds of Russian heavy weapons and troops have poured across the border; a commercial airliner was shot down this summer; Donetsk airport was obliterated," Nuland said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Nuland's testimony included the claim that "hundreds" of Russian tanks and other weapon systems have entered Ukraine to support the militias in Donetsk and Lugansk, all as Washington or any of its allies are yet to prove any of those hot headed statements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>When, back in December, Americans planned to publish photos allegedly of Russian vehicles entering Ukraine - they turned out to be 2008 photographs from South Ossetia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The only objective international monitoring force, the OSCE, has never detected any crossings of Russian military or its equipment into Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine suffered a reign of terror," said the chief strategist of US foreign policy in Ukraine, simply neglecting the fact that it was the chaos in Kiev that forced the Crimean referendum and subsequent ascension of the peninsula into Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The US diplomat also neglected to mention the thousands of civilian casualties which have occurred as a result of Kiev's so-called anti-terrorist operation in the east, launched after people in the region refused to recognize the coup in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Nuland implied that it was Moscow's actions that forced some 1.7 million Ukrainians to flee their homes - most of whom by coincidence ended up moving to Russia, the country taking care of the massive inflow of refugees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"This is a manufactured conflict - controlled by the Kremlin; fueled by Russian tanks and heavy weapons; financed at Russian taxpayers' expense and costing the lives of young Russians whose mothers, wives and children are told not to investigate their deaths too closely if they want to receive benefits," Nuland said failing to take into the account Washington's role in the Ukrainian tragedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>READ MORE: Ceasefire violations on decline in E.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Nuland's statement seemed to have resonated with equal passion inside the committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The committee chair, Representative Ed Royce, said the Kremlin "has recruited every skinhead and every malcontent in the Russian-speaking world and tried to bring them into the east" of Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Representative Eliot Engel accused Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, of spreading "lies, lies and more lies" and representative Albio Sires called the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, "a KGB thug who happens to be the head of another state," as quoted by the Guardian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>And while a number of Congressmen insisted that the Minsk ceasefire was not holding, and Nuland claimed the OSCE had confirmed "about a hundred" violations - the OSCE itself has just confirmed ceasefire violations over the past week have been on the decline in east Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Daniel McAdams, executive director of the Ron Paul Institute, told RT that "Victoria Nuland completely disregards the role of the US in starting the conflict in Ukraine. She completely glosses over the fact that the army supported by Kiev has been bombarding eastern Ukraine, as if these independence fighters are killing themselves and their own people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"What we are looking at is pure rhetoric and propaganda in the service of a preconceived geopolitical project, which has as one of its objectives that Minsk-2 doesn't work - that Russians are 'violating it.'", adds foreign affairs editor at the Chronicles magazine, Srdja Trifkovic.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali nine executions: Why Indonesians and Australians have different views on the death penalty for drug dealers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For many Indonesians, drug smuggling is akin to cold-blooded murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Narcotics offences are considered among the worst crimes against humanity in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While murderers - and even terrorists - kill a finite number of people, many Indonesians view drug dealers as mass murderers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Drug trafficking is considered a serious offence in Australia, but drug abuse tends to be viewed through the prism of personal choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Why the merry dance of a prolonged death march, complete with smiling selfies by those guarding the men on the plane to Death Island?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Indonesians are more likely to see drug users as victims of evil dealers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As heroin and other drugs are often smuggled into the country by international traffickers, the scourge is seen as a foreign one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This is a cultural difference that goes some way to explaining why the executions of Bali nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan have been treated so differently in the Indonesian and Australian media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Australian media has focused on the extraordinary rehabilitation of the two men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Their metamorphosis from naive, selfish young men into the painter and pastor who transformed a once notorious jail has been well documented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To the frustration of Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers and supporters, the Indonesian media has largely ignored the almost biblical narrative of their reformation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Instead it has concentrated on the "drug emergency" in Indonesia and the need for capital punishment as a deterrent to narcotics smuggling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>President Joko Widodo is often quoted saying 40 to 50 Indonesians die a day due to drugs, although it has been pointed out by some commentators that these figures are dubious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Asked in an interview with the television network al-Jazeera how he could justify taking another's life, Mr Joko talked about 4.5 million Indonesians whose lives are "in ruin" because of drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Don't just look at the people who sell drugs, look at their victims," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This is a refrain echoed by ordinary Indonesians, who constantly point to the deaths by overdose, the young lives lost to addiction and the anguish of their parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Cilacap undertaker Suhendro Putro has first-hand experience of executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He provides the coffins and has the grisly task of washing the bodies after they are shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Suhendro described to Fairfax Media waiting in the prison compound on Nusakambangan island with families of the condemned prisoners, who screamed when they heard the shots that killed their loved ones ring into the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Despite witnessing this horror, he still believes in capital punishment for narcotics offenders because he says drugs destroy the lives of many.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rosita, who runs a clothes stall at Teluk Penyu, the strip of beach in Cilacap just 200 metres from Nusakambangan, where Chan and Sukumaran will be executed, holds a similar view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I agree with the death penalty for drug criminals as drugs are very dangerous," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This difference in perspective helps to explain why Australian media saw the display of military force in the convicted duo's transferral from Bali on Wednesday as over the top and ludicrous for two reformed drug dealers, while Indonesian media seemed unsurprised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There are some voices of dissent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Indonesia's former foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda warned the Indonesian government to tone down its seemingly gleeful rhetoric about plans to execute foreign nationals on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"It's as if we enjoy killing people," he told the Jakarta Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But the divergent views of many Indonesians and Australians in relation to the death penalty for drug offences highlights stark cultural and political differences between the two nations despite our proximity.</td></tr>
