<h3>Donald Trump briefly kicks Univision's Jorge Ramos out of press conference</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Made-for-cable-TV Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump held a press conference Tuesday in Iowa -- and made news by kicking out Jorge Ramos, the star anchor of Miami-based Spanish-language TV giant Univision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the exchange -- aired on CNN, which was broadcasting the presser live from Dubuque -- Ramos tried to ask a question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Sit down," Trump said, dismissing him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You haven't been called."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I have the right to ask a question," Ramos countered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Go back to Univision," Trump said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"You cannot deport 11 million people..."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ramos continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A security guard came to escort him out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ramos was subsequently let back into the press conference and engaged with him -- "I have a bigger heart than you do," Trump told Ramos about how he plans to deal with immigrants in the country illegally -- and Trump even suggested there could be more to come later: "We'll talk," he concluded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The back and forth will likely prompt even more media exposure -- if that's possible -- for Trump, and some robust ratings for Ramos as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The two sides have a complicated history: Trump's Doral resort abuts Univision's headquarters (the company has an office in New York but its studios are in South Florida).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Univision severed ties with the Miss Universe Organization partly owned by Trump as a result of Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Trump banned Univision workers from his golf property and sued the network for breach of contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Miami-Dade County then publicly condemned Trump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In a statement, Univision President Isaac Lee said he hoped Ramos will get to see more of Trump -- which would undoubtedly be a boon for the network and its struggling English-language sister, Fusion: "We'd love for Mr. Trump to sit down for an in-depth interview with Jorge to talk about the specifics of his proposals."</td></tr>
