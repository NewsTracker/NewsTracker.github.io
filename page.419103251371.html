<h3>New IS affiliate claims responsibility for Saudi bombing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An alleged new affiliate of the Islamic State group in Saudi Arabia has claimed responsibility for an attack that targeted a mosque used by police special forces in the kingdom's southwest on Thursday, killing 15 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was one of the deadliest attacks in years against Saudi security forces that battled a wave of al-Qaida attacks about a decade ago and which have come under sporadic attacks in recent weeks in the capital, Riyadh, by militants purportedly linked to the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The claim by the so-called Hijaz Province of the Islamic State appeared hours after the attack in the city of Abha, close to Saudi Arabia's southern border with war-torn Yemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was carried on IS-affiliated Twitter accounts and was also reported by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks militant messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The statement says an IS suicide bomber targeted a "monument of the apostate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was the first claim by the purportedly new IS branch, which has not been heard of previously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The "Hijaz" in its name is a reference to the historic western part of Saudi Arabia that is home to Islam's holiest sites of Mecca and Medina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Previous attacks in the kingdom by Islamic State militants have been claimed by a group calling itself Najd Province, a reference to Saudi Arabia's central region, where Riyadh is located.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Interior Ministry said that an initial investigation indicated the suicide bomber wore an explosive belt and struck a mosque inside an Interior Ministry compound in Abha as members of the special forces and trainees were in the middle of afternoon prayers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The ministry's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, told The Associated Press it was too early to confirm whether IS or its supporters were behind the attack and that the police were still investigating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Local reports suggested the bomber entered the police compound disguised as a janitor, but al-Turki said this has also not been confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>According to state media, the mosque belongs to an Interior Ministry emergency services post in Abha, the provincial capital of Asir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>State TV carried images of the aftermath of the attack, showing blood splattered on the mosque walls and ceiling and debris scattered about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Islamic State's other affiliate in Saudi Arabia claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in the kingdom in recent months, including various deadly shootings and smaller attacks against police at checkpoints in Riyadh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The group claimed it was also behind a suicide bombing in May that struck a Shiite mosque in the eastern village of al-Qudeeh, killing 22 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That was the deadliest militant assault in the kingdom in more than a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A week later, a second suicide bombing claimed by the group outside another eastern Shiite mosque left four dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Saudi Arabia is part of a U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against the IS group in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The group has called on supporters in Saudi Arabia to stay and fight the Western-backed monarchy there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In November, police said IS sympathizers were behind the shooting at a Shiite place of worship in the eastern Saudi village of al-Ahsa that killed eight people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Saudi authorities last month announced the arrest of more than 400 suspects in an anti-terrorism sweep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In April, they announced the arrest of more than 90 suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They said in both sweeps that police had thwarted other IS attacks being plotted in the oil-rich kingdom, including a suicide bombings and attempts to attack diplomatic missions and security bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The kingdom is also leading a coalition targeting Iran-allied Shiite rebels in neighboring Yemen, not far from Abha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The rebels have carried out a number of cross-border attacks against military targets.</td></tr>
