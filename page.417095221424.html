<h3>Anti-Muslim Film: US Court Sides With Google</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A federal appeals court overturns an earlier ruling that ordered Google to remove Innocence Of Muslims from YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>YouTube should not have been forced to remove an anti-Muslim film that sparked violence in the Middle East, a US federal appeals court has ruled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The decision, seen as a victory for free speech advocates, overturned an earlier 2-1 ruling that ordered YouTube to scrub Innocence Of Muslims from its site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The film inspired rioting in 2012 by those who considered it blasphemous to the Prophet Mohammed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was initially cited by the Obama administration as the cause of an attack on a US mission in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>President Barack Obama and other world leaders asked Google, which owns YouTube, to take the film down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The low-budget movie also prompted death threats against actors who took part in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cindy Lee Garcia, who received threats, argued she had a copyright claim to the film because she believed she was acting in a different production.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Garcia said she had been paid $500 ( 319) to perform in a movie called Desert Warrior that she thought had nothing to do with religion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She ended up appearing in a five-second scene in Innocence Of Muslims, during which her character's dubbed-over voice asked if Mohammed was a child molester.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Google said Garcia had no claim because the filmmaker wrote the dialogue, managed the production and even dubbed over her lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The tech giant also argued that requests to pull the film down amounted to censorship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The film's creator, Mark Basseley Youssef, was imprisoned in 2012 for violating probation stemming from a 2010 cheque fraud case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He was released on probation in September 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Google has not said whether the film would be reposted on YouTube.</td></tr>
