<h3>Kenya destroy 15 tons of ivory taken from poachers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Twenty-five years since ivory trade was banned, new demand from emerging markets threatens Africa's elephants and rhinos, President Uhuru Kenyatta said at the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>African countries are concerned about the scale and rate of the new threat to endangered wildlife species, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Many of these tusks belonged to elephants which were wantonly slaughtered by criminals. We want future generations of Kenyans, Africans and the entire world to experience the majesty and beauty of these magnificent beasts. Poachers and their enablers will not have the last word," Kenyatta said before setting a blaze an almost 10 feet high pile of huge elephant tusks doused with petrol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Higher demand for ivory is fueling elephant killings by poachers across Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Save The Elephants said last year that 100,000 elephants were killed in Africa between 2010 and 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Thursday, China imposed a one-year ban on ivory imports amid criticism that its citizens' huge appetite for ivory threatens the existence of Africa's elephants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Save the Elephants founder, Ian Douglas Hamilton, said research released by his organization showed that the price of elephant ivory has tripled in China since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hamilton said Kenya has a long way to go before it can be clear of the poaching menace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The elephant populations in Tanzania, Gabon, Cameroun, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Republic of Congo and Congo are the worst hit by poaching, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The years 2011, 2012 and 2013 witnessed the highest levels of poaching since a poaching crisis in the 1980s, Kenya's Wildlife Service has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Poaching declined last year with 164 elephants and 35 rhinos killed, down from 302 elephants and 59 rhinos killed in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Officials attributed the decline partially to stiffer penalties adopted last year for those involved in the illegal wildlife business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We would like to tell the world to stop the trade in ivory because it is destroying our economy, our heritage, our environment," said Paul Udoto, a spokesman for the Kenya Wildlife Service.</td></tr>

<h3>Mystery Greek shipping magnate footing Amal Clooney?s bill to fight for repatriation of Elgin Marbles</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>That's why it needed bailing out by the rest of Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But then, the cash-strapped Greek government hires the high-profile and expensive London law firm that employs Amal Clooney, American actor George Clooney's glamorous new bride, to represent it in its never-ending quest to get the Elgin Marbles back from the British Museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With no public tender.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What's missing from this picture?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A Greek shipping magnate, of course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A former official in Greece's culture ministry said Monday that an unnamed Greek shipping tycoon who operates in both Athens and London wanted to make a "grand gesture of patriotism" by paying the London-based lawyers' legal fees, according to the London Times newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The official said the fees had been deemed "too extravagant" by the Greek government, which is in the midst of a financial crisis, the paper reported Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The official quoted by the newspaper worked for Konstantinos Tasoulas, a former Greek culture minister who was responsible for handling Greece's claims to the sculptures from the Parthenon in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Elgin Marbles sculptures are owned by the British Museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He refused to say whether the shipping tycoon first approached the Greek government, or the other way around, but he talked of the timing of the hiring of Amal Clooney and the rest of the team from the Doughty Street chambers in central London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The arrangement came immediately after Mrs. Clooney and her boss Geoffrey Robertson visited Athens three months ago," the paper quoted him as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said the offer of outside aide allowed the Greek government to sidestep a public tender for the work, which he said would have been "controversial for both sides."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tasoulas was culture minister at the time of Clooney's high-profile visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The ship owners' involvement proved pivotal," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Ever since, billing fees have been going straight to him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Clooney and the other members of her legal team visited Athens last October at the invitation of the Greek government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The visit came quickly on the heels of the lawyer's glamorous and well-publicized Venice wedding to actor George Clooney, which quickly lent the case some added notoriety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Asked about this financial aid from a Greek shipping tycoon, Robertson, Clooney's superior, said their fees would be paid by "a group of philanthropists at no expense to the Greek people," the paper reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The official said the London lawyers were due to present an estimated 300-page report to the Greek government in the coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"This opinion will be delivered after March 30, which is the deadline for the United Kingdom to reply to the UNESCO request for it to enter into mediation over the future of the Parthenon sculptures," Robertson was quoted by the newspaper as saying, referring to the U.N.'s culture agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The statues were removed from Athens and brought to Britain in the 19th century by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the then-Ottoman Empire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The British Museum argues that that was done with the full permission of the relevant authorities at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Athens has been trying for years to get the Greek sculptures back, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Unless the government wants to drop the restitution case altogether, it would be foolish to scrap this arrangement (between the shipping magnate and Mrs. Clooney's legal team), " the official was quoted by the newspaper as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It's free publicity and legal advice."</td></tr>
