<h3>Government to rush through guidelines to stop police snooping on journalists</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a letter to Labour MP Jack Dromey, Karen Bradley, a Home Office minister, said the government does not have time to bring through primary legislation until the next parliament, but confirmed it would introduce interim guidelines that will require the police to gain judicial approval before they can obtain information about journalists' sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The government has agreed to the changes after it emerged that the police have systematically been using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa) to require phone companies to hand over phone records and internet email logs of reporters, which has had the effect of discouraging both whistleblowing and challenging journalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Under the new guidelines, the police would be required to use production orders, which are judicially authorised, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Pace) for applications to see communications data that reveal journalistic sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Bradley said that the government would shortly publish draft clauses that would form the basis of new legislation early in the next parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Campaigners welcomed the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Evan Harris, campaign director at Hacked Off and a former Liberal Democrat MP, said: "The Tories talk grandly about press freedom but do nothing concrete. Since source protection is a critical part of the public interest role played by newspapers and broadcasters, Hacked Off decided to force the question. We are delighted it has succeeded."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A spokesman for deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said he was "glad the Tories have finally found some sense and have at the least agreed to ensure temporary measures are put in place to protect journalist sources".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sajid Javid, the culture secretary, previously signalled that he would like to see Ripa amended before the election in May after it emerged 608 journalists' phone records had been accessed by police in order to investigate leaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The revelation was contained in a report by the interception of communications commissioner Sir Anthony May. Since then, Clegg has written to Theresa May, the home secretary, urging her to bring forward changes in the law within the next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The review of surveillance powers was ordered after it emerged Scotland Yard accessed the phone records of the Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn to find who had leaked information on the Plebgate row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>May's report found that Ripa did not "provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources" and recommended that "judicial authorisation is obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Speaking at a lunch for political journalists in Westminster in early February, Javid confirmed he backed a change in the law: "I want to see the law changed to make it happen during this parliament, because there is no excuse for using anti-terror legislation to threaten legitimate reporting, no matter how awkward that reporting might be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Blowing a whistle on council corruption doesn't warrant undercover surveillance. A front page that embarrasses a senior politician is not a threat to national security. Journalism is not terrorism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Javid told the lunch that he was "shocked" by the extent of official snooping on the confidential sources of journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Democracy needs journalists to function," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"That is why last month's attacks in Paris struck a chord around the world. They weren't just an attack on a magazine, they were an attack on the ideals that underpin our way of life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Our journalists also face insidious threats from other quarters, be they commercial, judicial or political. Yesterday, we learnt the full extent to which Ripa was used to monitor journalists and their contacts. Like many of you, I was shocked by what was revealed."</td></tr>

<h3>White House mulls how to counter Netanyahu on Iran</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>President Barack Obama does not intend to be silent or out of sight when Netanyahu addresses Congress in a visit that was arranged by Speaker John Boehner behind the administration's back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The breach of protocol has grown to what seems like a grudge match between two men who dislike each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Vice President Biden will be out of town during Netanyahu's speech, leaving an empty chair behind the Israeli leader's podium and Secretary of State John Kerry may conveniently find a foreign trip to be on that day as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - In what is becoming an increasingly nasty grudge match, the White House is mulling ways to undercut Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming trip to Washington and blunt his message that a potential nuclear deal with Iran is bad for Israel and the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There are limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Administration officials have discarded the idea of President Barack Obama himself giving an Iran-related address to rebut the two speeches Netanyahu is to deliver during his early March visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But other options remain on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among them: a presidential interview with a prominent journalist known for coverage of the rift between Obama and Netanyahu, multiple Sunday show television appearances by senior national security aides and a pointed snub of America's leading pro-Israel lobby, which is holding its annual meeting while Netanyahu is in Washington, according to the officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The administration has already ruled out meetings between Netanyahu and Obama, saying it would be inappropriate for the two to meet so close to Israel's March 17 elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the White House is now doubling down on a cold-shoulder strategy, including dispatching Cabinet members out of the country and sending a lower-ranking official than normal to represent the administration at the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Vice President Joe Biden will be away, his absence behind Netanyahu conspicuous in coverage of the speech to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Other options were described by officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Netanyahu's plan for a March 3 address to a joint meeting of Congress has further strained already tense ties between the U.S. and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Congressional Republicans orchestrated Netanyahu's visit without consulting the White House or State Department, a move the Obama administration blasted as a break in diplomatic protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some Democratic lawmakers say they will boycott the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>U.S. officials believe Netanyahu's trip to Washington is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, Obama's signature foreign policy objective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While Netanyahu has long been skeptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions that would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His opposition has intensified as negotiations go into overdrive with an end-of-March deadline for a framework deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I think this is a bad agreement that is dangerous for the state of Israel, and not just for it," Netanyahu said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The difference of opinion over the deal has become unusually rancorous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The White House and State Department have both publicly accused Israeli officials of leaking "cherry-picked" details of the negotiations to try to discredit the administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And, in extraordinary admissions this week, the administration acknowledged that the U.S. is withholding sensitive details of the talks from Israel, its main Middle East ally, to prevent such leaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The rebukes have only emboldened the leader of Israel, whose country Iran has threatened to annihilate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He has a double-barrel attack on the Iran talks ready for when he arrives in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Not only will he address Congress, he will also deliver similar remarks at the AIPAC conference, an event to which administrations past and present have traditionally sent top foreign policy officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>An AIPAC official said Friday that the group has not yet received any reply to its invitation for senior administration figures to attend the meeting that starts March 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The official stressed that last-minute RSVPs are not unusual, but the White House has been signaling for some time that a Cabinet-level guest may not coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Instead, the administration is toying with the idea of sending newly installed Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken to speak to the conference, according to officials familiar with internal discussions on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But it's possible Treasury Secretary Jack Lew could attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, who have both previously addressed AIPAC, will be out of the country on foreign travel that appears to have been arranged to make them unavailable to speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Biden will be visiting Uruguay and Guatemala on a trip that was announced after Netanyahu's speech was scheduled, while the State Department announced abruptly this week that Kerry will be traveling to as-yet-determined destinations for the duration of the AIPAC conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Obama spoke to AIPAC in 2012, while he was in the midst of his re-election campaign.</td></tr>
