<h3>Greece Says It Will Never Accept Wage, Pension Cuts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece will never accept cuts in pensions and wages or extra taxes on necessities such as electricity, a government official says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The official says representatives of the International Monetary Fund insist on pension and wage savings worth about 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) and an equal amount of extra revenue from Value Added Tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"These measures concern the popular classes and employees," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing talks in Brussels between Greece and its creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He added that Greece will no longer accept measures that undermine growth and has submitted proposals that cover creditors' demands for a primary budget surplus without doing so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece and its creditors resumed talks on a bailout deal in Brussels Saturday.</td></tr>
