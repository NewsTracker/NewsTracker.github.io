<h3>Michael Brown's parents sue over son's death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLAYTON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - The parents of Michael Brown filed a wrongful-death lawsuit Thursday against the city of Ferguson over the fatal shooting of their son by a white police officer, a confrontation that sparked a national protest movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Attorneys for Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., filed the complaint at the St. Louis County Courthouse and called a news conference to announce the case, which had been expected for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Messages seeking comment from Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III, city spokesman Jeff Small and an attorney for Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, were not immediately returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brown, 18, was unarmed and walking in the street with a friend on Aug. 9 when Wilson told them to move to the sidewalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That led to a heated confrontation and a scuffle between Wilson and Brown inside Wilson's squad car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Wilson shot Brown after the scuffle spilled into the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some witnesses said Brown was trying to surrender, but Wilson said Brown was moving toward him aggressively, forcing him to shoot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national "Black Lives Matter" movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the end, local and federal authorities ruled that the shooting was justified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But the Justice Department released a scathing report citing racial bias and profiling in the Ferguson Police Department and a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targets black residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Two decades ago, football star O.J. Simpson was acquitted of the killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But a civil jury awarded the Brown and Goldman families $33.5 million in wrongful-death damages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The family of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man killed by police in 1999, settled with New York City for $3 million in 2004 after filing a $60 million lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The city did not admit any wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The settlement came after four officers indicted in his shooting were acquitted of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Wrongful-death lawsuits have been filed in other recent high-profile cases, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In New York, the family of Eric Garner is seeking $75 million in damages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Garner, who was black and had asthma, died in July after a white plainclothes officer applied what a medical examiner determined was a chokehold after Garner was accused of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes on a city street.</td></tr>
