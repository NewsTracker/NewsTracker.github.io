<h3>Netanyahu Urges U.S. To Hold Out For Better Nuclear Deal With Iran</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a controversial address to Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Obama administration's negotiations on limiting the Iranian nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Israel's prime minister urged the U.S. Congress today to hold out for a better nuclear deal with Iran, but President Obama says Benjamin Netanyahu offered no viable alternative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>We're going to begin this hour with reaction to Netanyahu's speech, including the view from Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That's where Secretary of State John Kerry negotiated with his Iranian counterpart today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>First, here's NPR's Michele Kelemen on how Netanyahu's address was received in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: While Netanyahu began his speech with a nod to President Obama's support for Israel, he quickly turned to his major critique of U.S. foreign-policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He says the U.S. is giving Iran too many concessions, negotiating a deal that would leave Iran with - in his words - a vast nuclear infrastructure and facing restrictions that would only last about a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: It doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It paves Iran's path to the bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>So why would anyone make this deal?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>KELEMEN: He says Iran's regime is, quote, "radical as ever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Israeli prime minister says he thinks the greatest danger in the world today is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So he wants the U.S. to hold out for a deal that would prevent Iran from acquiring them and threatening Israel's very survival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>NETANYAHU: A better deal that won't give Iran an easy path to the bomb, a better deal that Israel and its neighbors may not like, but with which we could live - literally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>KELEMEN: The members of Congress who attended this speech gave him numerous standing ovations, but dozens of Democrats stayed away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>REPRESENTATIVE JOHN YARMUTH: This speech was straight out of the Dick Cheney playbook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This was fear mongering at its ultimate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>KELEMEN: That's Kentucky Congressman John Yarmuth, who says he resents the Israeli prime minister's attempts to tell the Obama administration how to negotiate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Illinois Democrat Jan Schakowsky adds, she thinks Netanyahu is trying to, quote, "stampede the U.S. into war once again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>REPRESENTATIVE JAN SCHAKOWSKY: We should be able to continue to lock down and roll back in a verifiable way Iran's ability to achieve a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That's the goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>We can't achieve it Bibi Netanyahu's way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>KELEMEN: President Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, made a similar case to the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC last night, telling them, quote, "we cannot let a totally unachievable ideal stand in the way of a good agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>SUSAN RICE: I know that some of you will be urging Congress to insist that Iran forgo its domestic enrichment capacity entirely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>KELEMEN: That was clearly not meant as an applause line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Rice had to wait for the crowd to sit back down to finish her thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>RICE: But as desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic nor achievable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>KELEMEN: No one, she says, can make Iran unlearn the expertise it already has.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Netanyahu, in his speech to Congress, says it's the infrastructure that matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>NETANYAHU: Nuclear know how without nuclear infrastructure doesn't get you very much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A racecar driver without a car can't drive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A pilot without a plane can't fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Without thousands of centrifuges, tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities, Iran can't make nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>KELEMEN: President Obama says he didn't watch Netanyahu's speech, but read the transcript and didn't find anything new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: On the core issue, which is how do we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, which would make it far more dangerous and would give it scope for even greater action in the region, the prime minister didn't offer any viable alternatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>KELEMEN: He says Netanyahu made almost the same speech last year when the U.S. and other world powers reached a temporary agreement with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>That deal has held, Obama says, and he calls the current negotiations the best chance the U.S. and its partners have to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington.</td></tr>
