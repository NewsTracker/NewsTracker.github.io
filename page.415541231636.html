<h3>Ariana brings fun, but there are some problems</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Her Tuesday night performance drew a high-pitched crowd of 75,068, good for 10th in all-time paid attendance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Even the pre-show screams were louder than usual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She was flanked by eight dancers and a DJ, who played Grande's R&B-and-EDM-flavored pop tracks in place of a live band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He took over when she left the stage, more than once, for a makeshift dressing room just off the main stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She returned in the same outfit - black thigh-high boots, clear plastic miniskirt - minus a pair of cat ears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They reappeared during a second trip offstage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>(Maybe her ponytail needed brushing.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was a precisely choreographed show, from the dance moves to the costumes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There were lots of energy and vocal runs Grande clearly picked up at the Mariah Carey School for Divas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kickoff "Bang Bang" was a blast of energy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Things lagged a bit, however, during an early string of non-singles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It would have been smarter to front load the show with at least one more hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Things picked back up during early hits "Right There" and "The Way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But Grande doesn't really know how to fill space between songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Her banter amounts to little more than cries of "Let's go!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And her oft-criticized enunciation is indeed a distraction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It was almost impossible to understand more than a few words during "Tattooed Heart" and "One Last Time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>(Ramen? Did she say ramen?)</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It was undeniably fun, however, to see her turn the dirt arena into a neon rave during the pulsing grooves of "Love Me Harder," "All My Love" and standout "Break Free," which showcased a range that floated to the heavens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She seemed a bit winded during set closer "Problem," though the crowd didn't seem to care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>All that ponytail flipping is hard work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>See photos of fans and the pop star in the slideshow above.</td></tr>

<h3>Johnson, Chievous score 15 to keep Pirates alive, 74-64 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>1 Kentucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>''Jesus on speed dial,'' he kidded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>So after Hampton extended its unlikely run, beating Manhattan 74-64 Tuesday night in the First Four to dial up a date with the mighty Wildcats, Joyner grabbed a cell phone and pretended to make a really, really long-distance call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''Hello?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hello?'' he said at a postgame news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Reginald Johnson scored 15 points and made two critical defensive plays down the stretch and Quinton Chievous added 15 points and 13 rebounds before leaving with a sprained ankle in the final minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Pirates (17-17) scored the first seven points, led by as many as 12 in the opening half and then, after Manhattan had rallied within a point, pulled away at the finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Johnson sealed the game with two huge steals, the second leading to his floor-length assist pass to Emmanuel Okoroba for a layup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Okoroba then hit a scoop shot on a drive and the lead was 67-58 with 90 seconds remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Manhattan (19-14) never threatened again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 68th team in a 68-team field, Hampton won as an underdog yet again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''We love that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>We take that head on,'' said Brian Darden, who scored 13 points including clinching free throws at the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Shane Richards scored 17 points and Emmy Andujar 11 for the Jaspers, champions of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''You have to give Hampton credit,'' said coach Steve Masiello, who played four years at Kentucky and would have been the center of attention in Louisville had his team won.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''I know we're all caught up in whether they had a losing record, (the fact that) they're 68th and we're 67.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>ABOUT THOSE WILDCATS: Chievous said Hampton will have to have an attitude when it tackles Kentucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''It's really just going in with a great mindset,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''Not being intimidated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And just playing as hard as we can and knocking down all our shots and just never giving up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When adversity hits us, we can't get down on ourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>NO LOSERS' LAMENT: Hampton is the 24th team to make the NCAA Tournament field with a losing record - and became the third in four years to win a game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Pirates started the season 1-5, won only two of 10 games during one span in the heart of the schedule, and closed the regular season just 12-17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They won four in a row to win the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Tournament's automatic NCAA berth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''As a team we never stopped believing,'' Joyner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''Yeah, it's a heck of a reversal for us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>BIG QUESTION MARKS: Chievous went down hard after being fouled at the 2:59 mark and his team leading 62-58.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>After he was helped off the court, Ke'Ron Brown replaced him and hit the second of two free throws to push the lead to five - touching off a 6-0 run that put the game away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Pirates were already without leading scorer (13.0) and rebounder (7.5), Dwight Meikle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He was sidelined five games ago with a high ankle sprain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''I just couldn't go any more, and my team ended up pulling it out,'' said Chievous, a Tennessee transfer in his first year with the Pirates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Joyner said Meikle was day to day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Hampton: No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>15-seeded Hampton shocked second-seeded Iowa State 58-57 in the 2001 tournament's first round in Boise, Idaho, when Tarvis Williams hit a 4-footer with 6.9 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It ranks as the greatest win in program history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Manhattan: The Jaspers won't get a chance to create a bracket racket as they have twice before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Seeded 12th, they surprised No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>5 Florida 75-60 in the 2004 first round, and also pinned fourth-seeded Oklahoma with a 77-67 loss in the first round in 1995.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>They fell to 3-9 in their eight trips to the NCAAs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Hampton: Mighty Kentucky awaits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Manhattan: The Jaspers return two starters, juniors Ashton Pankey who averaged 13.5 ppg and Richards at 13.1, along with several top freshmen and sophomores.</td></tr>
