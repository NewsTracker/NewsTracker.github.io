<h3>Agent: Tiger to play this week's Wyndham for 1st time (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Tiger Woods will play the Wyndham Championship for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In an email to The Associated Press on Monday, agent Mark Steinberg confirmed that Woods will play in Greensboro this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That ends a few days of uncertainty around Sedgefield County Club, the site of the final tournament of golf's regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Woods created a stir by entering the field just ahead of the deadline last Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But after closing out a 73 and missing the cut at the PGA Championship in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, he hedged a bit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Monday morning, Wyndham tournament director Mark Brazil sent out a brief tweet: ''Bam!</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The first round begins Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Wyndham annually is the last chance for the PGA Tour's bubble players to play their way into the FedEx Cup playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They begin next week at The Barclays in New Jersey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Woods - who's at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>187 on the points list - comes to Greensboro rather far from the bubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Only the top 125 players reach the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mathematically, Woods will need to either win (and earn 500 points) or finish alone in second place (300 points) to crack the top 125.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Last year, only one player outside the top 125 - Sang-Moon Bae - earned enough points here to move into the playoffs, jumping from No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>126 to No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>120 after his tie for 14th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nobody did it in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Now the question is how long Woods will stick around at Sedgefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In 10 events this year, Woods missed the cut in four of them and withdrew from another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He missed the cut in the last three majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He had three rounds in the 80s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>His best finish was a tie for 17th at the Masters, a remarkable effort coming off a two-month break to fix a short game that turned shockingly bad in Phoenix and San Diego.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>His best week was The Greenbrier Classic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>While he tied for 32nd, he finished six shots out of the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In the other four events where he made the cut, he was no closer than 10 shots.</td></tr>
