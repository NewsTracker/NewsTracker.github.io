<h3>Islamic State militants claim attack on checkpoint in Libya's capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Militants loyal to Islamic State claimed an attack at a checkpoint in a suburb of the Libyan capital on Sunday, according to a statement on social media, days after a similar attack on a police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A bag of explosives went off at a checkpoint next to a Janzour security directorate building, west of Tripoli, wounding five policemen, said Essam Nas, a local security spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One of the wounded policemen is in a serious condition, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Islamic State militants published on social media a picture of a security directorate building next to the checkpoint which they said was the location of an explosion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Militants loyal to Islamic State, the group that controls much of Syria and Iraq, have been exploiting the chaos in Libya where two governments allied to armed factions are vying for power four years after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Groups of Islamist militants, who have declared loyalty to Islamic State over the past six months, have claimed responsibility for several high-profile attacks in what appears to be an intensifying campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They claimed responsibility for an attack on the Corinthia luxury hotel in Tripoli in January, which killed five foreigners and at least four Libyans, as well as a group of Egyptian Copts in the central city of Sirte, triggering air strikes by Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The site of Sunday's explosion is close to the Palm City compound, which used to be a favorite place of accommodation for diplomats and expatriates until last summer when most left due to the deteriorating security situation.</td></tr>

<h3>Shifting how veterans are portrayed in TV, film</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Called "6 Certified," after the military term that means "I've got your back," the program is being launched with the support of First Lady Michelle Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The campaign seeks to shift perception of veterans in pop culture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Studios, producers and other content creators will be eligible for the certification badge if the work contains "a representative and balanced depiction of veterans" and fulfills at least one of six pledges: to research or consult with veterans, family members or experts in the subject; to cast a veteran; to hire a veteran as a writer; to portray a veteran character; to tell a veteran story, or to use veterans as resources on set or in writers' rooms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Studies show that the public can have skewed views of veterans based on what's seen in film or on television, said Chris Marvin, executive director of Got Your 6, the group launching the new program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They are heroes on one end of the spectrum or broken veterans on the other end of the spectrum," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Marvin, an Army veteran, cited Ed O'Neill's role as Jay Pritchett on "Modern Family" and Bradley Cooper's depiction of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle in "American Sniper" as accurate portrayals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In "Modern Family," Pritchett is "first and foremost a small-business owner, father and grandfather" who happens to be a Navy veteran, Marvin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"American Sniper," he said, tells "a great story that American audiences were anxious to hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I think the American public is thirsty to have a conversation about the war, about returning veterans, about the issues and about opportunities that surround that group of people," Marvin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Veterans a lot of the time are everyday people but not many take the time to incorporate that into their content development."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Skewed portrayals of veterans in pop culture can "get in the way of veterans re-integrating to life," Marvin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"When that's the only view that the civilian population gets of veterans, that tends to be how they think all veterans are."</td></tr>
