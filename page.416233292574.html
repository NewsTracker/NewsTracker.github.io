<tr><td>4</td><td>Russia also backs rebels in the eastern part of Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It marks a significant escalation in Canada's military involvement in the region and could spark questions about whether Canadian troops are being drawn into a dangerous conflict with Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Canada continues to stand with the people of Ukraine in the face of the Putin regime's ongoing aggression," Harper said in a written statement accompanying the announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The Canadian military contribution being announced today will help Ukrainian forces' personnel to better defend their country's sovereignty and territorial integrity."</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>The government said the Canadian Armed Forces members will be deployed "on both a sustained and periodic basis" - depending on the type of training being conducted.</td></tr>
