<h3>MABS helps 300,000 deal with debt problems</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Figures released by MABS to RTE News indicate that since 2009, close to half its clients were helped face-to-face to deal with debts amounting to 2.5bn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The service - which is free and confidential - says it's concerned that many people are paying other organisations for advice on indebtedness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to official figures, to date this recession has pushed over half a million people into enforced deprivation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service has acted for many of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Half its clients have mortgages, and inevitably some fall into arrears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>MABS criticised the mortgage-to-rent scheme for being too restrictive and also for the veto it says has been given to lenders over its operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Department of the Environment says about 2,600 applications have been made for the housing association-based scheme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But only 64 have been successful to date and another 442 are being processed actively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A further 1,000 are with lenders who are seeking the borrowers' consent for independent valuations and other actions to be carried out.</td></tr>
