<h3>Little certainty 1 year after airliner shot down in Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FOR STORY UKRAINE MH17 WHERE THINGS STAND - FILE - In this Saturday, July 19, 2014 file photo emergency workers carry the body of a victim at the crash site of a Malaysia Airlines jet near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A year since a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was blown out of the sky over war-ravaged eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people, there has been little definitive progress in determining what brought down Flight MH17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>MOSCOW (AP) - A year since a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was blown out of the sky over war-ravaged eastern Ukraine - killing 298 people - there has been little official word of progress in determining what brought down Flight MH17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One of the probes under way reportedly points toward a ground-to-air missile fired from a village held by Russia-backed separatist rebels, but the report isn't to be public for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Another investigation trudges forward with painful slowness, and contradictory theories emerge from Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A fog of vehement allegations, macabre claims and self-serving rhetoric shrouds the tragedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Within hours of the July 17, 2014 crash, a crucial fact appeared clear - the wreckage was strewn over such a wide area that the plane must have broken into bits long before it fell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Most evidence points to the plane, which departed from Amsterdam en route to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, being taken down by a missile over an area controlled by pro-Russia rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But whether the missile was fired from a warplane or from the ground remains unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As is the question of who fired: the Ukrainian army, the separatist rebels or Russian forces allegedly backing them with troops and arms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An international investigation may be able to answer the first question, but not until at least October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Another probe addressing the second is likely to take until at least next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The investigation led by the Dutch Safety Board aims only to determine the crash cause, not to ascribe blame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That's likely to produce a report loaded with esoteric technical detail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A preliminary report from the board in September was able to say only that the plane was destroyed by "high-energy objects" that pierced it from outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A draft version of the final report was circulated this month to representatives of Malaysia, Ukraine, the U.S., Russia, Britain, Australia and the Netherlands for their comments and suggested revisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Oleg Storchevoi, a deputy chief of the Russian aviation agency, said the agency has complaints regarding both the technical data and the arguments in the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He did not give details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But a U.S. official told The Associated Press that the draft says the plane was destroyed by a Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile fired from the village of Snizhne, which was under rebel control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The official, who wasn't authorized to comment publicly, spoke on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The probe is being led by The Netherlands because 196 of the victims were Dutch, and Ukraine agreed to give Holland formal responsibility for the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A probe by the Dutch national prosecutor's office aims to establishing who was responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This investigation includes authorities from Ukraine, Malaysia and other countries whose nationals were among the victims, but Russia is not a participant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It is unclear whom the investigators are questioning, or the extent of the evidence they've collected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The prosecutor's office released a video calling on witnesses to come forward and indicated the probe is focusing on rebel or Russian involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The video asks for information about a Buk-11 missile system that was spotted moving through the rebel territory before and after the crash, then possibly heading for the Russian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The investigative organization Bellingcat also has devoted attention to this missile-launcher, claiming it can be traced to one that was stored in the rebels' main stronghold of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Rebel officials at the time denied having any such missile systems, although Russian news agencies had reported rebel claims of seizing some from Ukrainian forces a few weeks earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Russia is opposing a proposed UN Security Council resolution to establish an international criminal tribunal for the crash; Moscow has veto power in the security council.</td></tr>
