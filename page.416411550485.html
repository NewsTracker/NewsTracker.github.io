<h3>US 'concerned' by sentencing of Egypt's Morsi, 14 more</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington (AFP) - The United States expressed its concern on Tuesday after an Egyptian court sentenced Islamist former president Mohamed Morsi and 14 of his supporters to hefty jail terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Washington would "review the basis" for the court's decision to imprison Morsi for 20 years and was "concerned by these sentences."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Morsi was convicted of ordering the arrest and torture of demonstrators involved in clashes in 2012 when he was still Egypt's elected president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fourteen others were convicted of the same charges, with most also sentenced by the Cairo court to 20 years in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the court acquitted the defendants of inciting murder during the December 5, 2012 clashes -- and thus removed the threat of the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Egypt's first freely elected leader, Morsi came to power following the 2011 ouster of veteran strongman Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But, after just a year in power, Morsi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following more mass street protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has been banned and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail.</td></tr>
