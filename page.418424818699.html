<h3>Facebook Looking to Stream Music Videos</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook is considering to add music videos to its news feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The social networking giant has had preliminary discussions with record companies about licensing music videos for its platform, according to a New York Times report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Initially, Facebook apparently just wants to test the waters, adding just a limited amount of videos to its news feed, and keeping tabs on their performance until the end of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Labels would be able to choose the videos in question, and Facebook share any resulting advertising revenue with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Music videos could help Facebook to grow its video views, and in turn steal more eyeballs from YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Facebook is already delivering more than four billion video views a day to its users, and has in recent months put a lot of efforts into further growing that view count as well as ramping up monetization of all of those eyeballs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Just this week, reports surfaced that Facebook was testing a kind of picture-in-picture mode: Select users are now able to keep a video in the foreground while still browsing their news feed -- something that should bode particularly well for music videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We've heard from some people that they'd like to watch videos while they scroll through News Feed. We're running a small test where you can create a smaller floating screen which continues playing the video while you scroll through your News Feed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on its music video plans.</td></tr>
