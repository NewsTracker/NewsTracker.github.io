<tr><td>2</td><td>The 25-year-old songstress took to Twitter on Thursday to reveal her album will indeed be featured on the new streaming service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"After the events of this week, I've decided to put 1989 on Apple Music ... and happily so," Swift wrote to her close to 60 million followers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"In case you're wondering if this is some exclusive deal like you've seen Apple do with other artists, it's not," she continued.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>"I find it to be shocking, disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company," she wrote, vowing to keep her successful album "1989" off of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"#AppleMusic will pay artists for streaming, even during customers' free trial period," Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, wrote later Sunday following Swift's declaration.</td></tr>
