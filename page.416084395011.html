<h3>Who are the 'Bali Nine'?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australians Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, center, part of the "Bali Nine" await trial in 2010 in Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called "Bali Nine."</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation.</td></tr>

<tr><td>35</td><td>During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year: "A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, "The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the "extensive rehabilitation" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to "use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution."</td></tr>
