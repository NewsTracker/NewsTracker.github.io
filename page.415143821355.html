<h3>UN says death toll in eastern Ukraine passes 6,000, cites Russian involvement</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>More than 6,000 people have died in eastern Ukraine since the start of the conflict almost a year ago that has led to a "merciless devastation of civilian lives and infrastructure," the U.N. human rights office said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hundreds of civilians and military personnel have been killed in recent weeks alone after an upswing in fighting particularly near Donetsk airport and in the Debaltseve area, the Geneva-based body said in a report covering the period from December to February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The strategic railroad town of Debaltseve was captured from Ukrainian government forces last month by pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While Russia denies its troops are fighting in Ukraine, the U.N. cited "credible reports (that) indicate a continuing flow of heavy weaponry and foreign fighters" from Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This has sustained and enhanced the capacity of armed groups of the self-proclaimed 'Donetsk people's republic' and 'Luhansk people's republic' to resist Government armed forces and to launch new offensives in some areas, including around the Donetsk airport, Mariupol and Debaltseve," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>U.N. rights chief Zeid Raad al-Hussein said many civilians stay in embattled areas "because they fear for their lives if they try to move."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Many others stay to protect children, other family members, or their property," while some are forced to stay or unable to leave, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The report cited "credible allegations of arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearances, committed mostly by the armed groups but in some instances also by the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It noted video footage appeared to support allegations of summary executions by the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The displacement of 1 million people has also increased the risk for women from sex traffickers, the report found.</td></tr>

<h3>Army National Guard Soldier surprises daughters for youngest's second birthday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Army National Guard Sgt First Class Joseph Kern flew home to Cherry Hill, New Jersey during his fifth deployment on Thursday and will be with his family for five days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His first stop after he touched down on American soil was his two-year-old daughter Pearl's classroom, where he had the chance to surprise her and his other daughter, three-year-old Estelle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He surprised the girls in Pearl's (front) classroom on her second birthday on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kern's wife, Sarah Woldoff, a neuro-psychologist in Princeton, said that the military no longer offers leave, so the couple had to pay out of pocket for him to come home, according to ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He left for Qatar in June and had already missed Estelle's birthday, so Woldoff said her husband's plane ticket was 'worth every dollar'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She added that seeing Kern reunite with their daughters was 'breathtaking'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Estelle was 'a little bit confused and in shock' when she saw her dad, according to Woldoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Unfortunately, Pearl didn't seem to recognize her dad when he walked in, and instead when to hug her grandpa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'We were both slightly disappointed with Pearl's response,' Woldoff told ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the mom-of-two hopes that having the reunion on video will help her daughter remember it when she get older.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'In hindsight, I'm really glad we did it the way we did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pearl's too little to have the memory of it, but I think Estelle will remember,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'And it'll ease the transition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His daughters weren't the only ones he had the chance to surprise during his time home, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kern surprised his mom at a restaurant by dressing up like a waiter and walking around the dining room as she ate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'My mother-in-law didn't even realize it was him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>We had to point it out,' Woldoff said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'She lost it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kern will likely be in Qatar until June, making it a year-long deployment, according to NorthJersey.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kern left for Qatar last June and will likely stay until this upcoming June, making it a year-long trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Estelle and Pearl apparently have a pillow with their dad's picture on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>This is Kern's fifth deployment with the Army National Guard.</td></tr>
