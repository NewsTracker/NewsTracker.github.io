<li>CIA plans major reorganisation and a focus on digital espionage</li>
<li>CIA Director John Brennan has outlined a plan for the reorganisation of the agency.</li>
<li>The plans were unveiled by CIA director John Brennan to a workforce in which thousands of employees are likely to see changes in which departments they work for, the lines of authority they report to and even where they sit.</li>
<li>The CIA will also create a new directorate focused exclusively on exploiting advances in computer technology and communications.</li>
<li>The Directorate of Digital Innovation will rank alongside the agency's operations and analysis branches, and be responsible for missions ranging from cyber-espionage to the security of the CIA's internal email.</li>
<li>After the reorganisation, Mr Brennan said, the CIA should be in position to "cover the entire universe, regionally and functionally, and so something that's going on in the world falls into one of those buckets".</li>
<li>The head of the CIA's clandestine service recently decided to retire abruptly in part because of opposition to a plan that would strip his position of much of its authority over the agency's covert operations overseas and the teams of spies that it deploys.</li>
