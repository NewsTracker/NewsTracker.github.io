<li>CIA failing to recruit and promote minorities, study finds</li>
<li>FILE - In this Dec. 11, 2014 file photo, CIA Director John Brennan pauses during a news conference at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.</li>
<li>The CIA's senior executive ranks are only 10.8 percent racial and ethnic minorities, the studied concluded, in a nation where non-whites comprise about 30 percent of the population.</li>
<li>But Brennan, who is fluent in Arabic and led the CIA station in Saudi Arabia, spoke of a pressing, mission-driven need for more diversity.</li>
<li>While the CIA has done a good job integrating white women into its upper ranks, minority women have not fared nearly as well, the study found.</li>
