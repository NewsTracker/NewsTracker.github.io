<h3>Uninsured rate drops again under ObamaCare</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Gallup-Healthways survey released Monday finds that the rate of people lacking health insurance fell one percentage point, from 12.9 percent, at the end of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Since ObamaCare's coverage expansion went into effect at the beginning of 2014, the rate has fallen from 17.1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gallup notes that some of the decrease could also be due to the improving economy, but that the health law appears to be playing a major role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The rate is lower than its 14.6 percent mark at the beginning of 2008, which was before the economy crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Obama administration has been using the declining numbers to argue that the law is working.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It touted its estimate in March, based on Gallup data, that 16 million people had gained coverage because of the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The evidence shows that the Affordable Care Act is working, and families, businesses and taxpayers are better off as a result," HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The coverage expansion faces a threat from the Supreme Court, which could gut the law by invalidating the subsidies that help about 7.5 million people afford coverage, in the case of King v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The data released Monday shows that the drop in the uninsured rate appears to be slowing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the first enrollment period, in 2014, the rate fell 1.5 percentage points, but in this year's enrollment period, it fell one point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The uninsured rate among Hispanic people has dropped at a higher rate, down 8.3 points since the beginning of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hispanics have a higher uninsured rate, at 30.4 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The uninsured rate for African Americas dropped 7.3 percentage points to 13.6 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Burwell said in March that for African Americans and Latinos, the statistics are "not probably exactly where you want to be because the numbers are still high."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She noted that she hit the road to boost enrollment, including a stop at a largely African-American church in Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The administration has also purchased advertising targeting hispanics, and has put messages on receipts at 7-Elevens.</td></tr>
