<h3>Israeli election chief puts curbs on Netanyahu speech to Congress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The speech has caused controversy in Israel and the United States, where Democrats and the White House are angry that the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, invited Netanyahu to speak at a sensitive time in the nuclear negotiations between Iran and six big powers including Washington, and only two weeks before Israel's closely fought March 17 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Following complaints from opposition parties, election chief Salim Joubran decided that Netanyahu's address should be broadcast with a five-minute delay in Israel, giving news editors time to cut any statements deemed partisan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Editors-in-chief of broadcast channels will watch and make sure that nothing the prime minister says can be construed as election campaigning," Joubran said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Any campaigning will be omitted from the broadcast."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>President Barack Obama, at odds with Netanyahu over the Israeli prime minister's criticism of the nuclear talks, will not meet him during his visit, saying it is a breach of protocol to receive a foreign leader before an election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In Israel, Netanyahu has been roundly criticised even by some of his right-wing allies, mostly for appearing to put his ties to the Republican Party ahead of the close relationship Israel has always had with the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In an apparent rebuttal of domestic criticism of his intention to address Congress, Netanyahu began a speech in English to American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem on Monday night in which he questioned -- in Hebrew - why the details of a possible deal with Iran were being hidden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Just as Iran knows what deal it has been offered, naturally, Israel also knows what are the details of the deal that is being formulated... But if somebody thinks that this is a good deal, why is it being hidden?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Netanyahu asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After weeks of negative commentary, officials close to the prime minister's office said last week the format of the speech could be changed, with Netanyahu possibly speaking behind closed doors or in smaller groups of congressmen rather than in a primetime televised address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But Netanyahu appeared to rule out to any change of plans, saying he was determined to honour the invitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Israeli leader has vowed to foil what he says would be a "bad and dangerous agreement" on Iran's nuclear programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With a month until the election, some polls suggest voters are unhappy about his appearance in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A survey by Army Radio showed 47 percent thought Netanyahu should cancel the address, while 34 percent said he should go ahead with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Overall, however, Netanyahu's Likud party remains marginally ahead, with most polls expecting it to win 24 or 25 seats in the 120-seat parliament, just ahead of the centre-left opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even if the centre-left wins, most analysts expect Netanyahu will be the only one able to form a workable coalition among right-wing and religious parties, allowing him to return as prime minister for a fourth term.</td></tr>

<h3>Channel 4 film 'Ukip: The First Hundred Days' imagines life under PM Nigel Farage</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>UKIP: The First 100 Days has already become Britain's second most complained-about one-off show of the past five years since it aired at 9pm last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The broadcaster was accused of anti-democratic fear- for airing the drama, which painted a country divided by race riots, mass unemployment and a crashing economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Channel 4 said it ordered the drama - which lampooned Ukip, its leaders and its supporters - as a way of engaging people in politics in the run-up to the May General Election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>By 4.30pm today Ofcom said it had already received 1,656 complaints about alleged political bias, while an online petition calling for Channel 4 to apologise reached 2,500 signatures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Channel 4 also received 250 complaints.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A spokesman did not say what they referred to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That makes the show one of the most complained-about one-off programmes of recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Only a Channel 4 Cutting Edge documentary about dog fighting last year prompted more Ofcom complaints since 2010, with a total of 1,805.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Aside from that, only regular shows such as Big Brother, The X Factor, This Morning and ITV News have received more complaints.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The film showed Ukip winning a slim majority in May's Election, before the country sits on the brink of collapse three months later under Mr Farage's leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However, many viewers felt that the drama was highly biased against the party and even undermined the broadcaster's impartiality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Viewers immediately took to Twitter to express their fury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Several Ukip supporters, meanwhile, shared details of how to complain to Ofcom with other party members as criticism mounted today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Comedian Jason Manford also expressed his concern with the programme on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said: 'I hate Ukip as much as the next sensible human but that just wasn't very good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nigel Farage, leader of Ukip, criticised the show before it aired, but said he thought it had on Channel 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>[It is] a biased, partisan depiction of the only party that Believes in Britain, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Suzanne Evans, Ukip deputy chairman, wrote on Twitter after the show aired: 'First three mins was brill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Rest was just daft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Won't do us any harm at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The only truth the documentary revealed was the bias of the commentariat class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>I think it will magnify Ukip's appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Douglas Carswell, who became Ukip's first elected MP last October, said: 'We are doing a great deal of work in the key seats that Ukip is focused on winning and the Channel 4 mockumentary reinforces the view amongst those voters that we are presided over by a smug, arrogant, out-of-touch commentariat class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'The mockumentary was supposed to damage Ukip but I think it's reinforced the sense of cultural alienation and I think it makes people more likely to vote for Ukip against the cartel in Westminster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mr Carswell said he found it interesting that the programme did not focus on Ukip's 'success built on credible, liberal policies' demonstrated in recent by-elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Clacton MP added: 'It's the most egregious of bias but we have that from the state-funded and state-backed mainstream media every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mr Carswell said he could not imagine a similar programme being made about the Green Party, adding: 'The only truth the documentary revealed was the bias of the commentariat class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Channel 4's head of documentaries Nick Mirsky said the controversial drama just showed the party having 'a bit of a bumpy ride'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Many people were ready to disagree with him before the show had even aired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>By Monday afternoon, 20 people had already complained to Ofcom, amid fears that the drama was too heavily skewed against Ukip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mr Farage - who was not allowed to watch the drama before its broadcast - also dismissed the show as liberal 'poppycock'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>However, Mr Mirsky argued that the drama was fair, and that the timing was not an issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'We're not in an election window so it is [not a problem],' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>'We did take care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A filmmaker credited as the show's director is due in court on Friday as one of 13 people accused of taking part in a 2.5million tax fraud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Chris Atkins, 38, of Hampstead, North London, is charged with one count of conspiring to cheat the revenue over five years to 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Prosecutors claim there was a complex scam centred on a now-dissolved film investment firm, Edinburgh and Walsh LLP, which conspired to submit false tax returns so it could claim tax relief on the firm's losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>After Friday's brief hearing, a six-week trial is due to begin in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Atkins is an established filmmaker who has made documentaries criticising tabloid journalism and celebrity culture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He was nominated for a Bafta in 2007 for Taking Liberties, which examined the erosion of civil liberties under Tony Blair's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The credit under his name for directing the Ukip drama was listed by Channel 4 and on his agent's website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The case was previously reported by The Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Atkins could not be reached for comment today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Channel 4 said it could not comment on ongoing court proceedings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>But Mr Mirsky admitted the film did not have to be 'politically balanced' because was being shown outside of the official General Election campaign period, which starts on March 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>He said: 'Our job is to reflect and explore contemporary British life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Nothing represents what's different and unique in British political life now more than the rise of Ukip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The film combined acted scenes with actual news footage and showed race riots breaking out in Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>It centred on Deepa Kaur, an Asian MP played by Priyanga Burford, who is embraced by Ukip as the face of its anti-immigration stance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Kaur is tipped for a Cabinet post but faces furious demonstrations when the largest employer in her constituency is put out of business by Farage's decision to pull Britain out of the EU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>She then decides she has been 'used' by Mr Farage, and condemns forced removal raids as 'aggressive and un-British'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The provocative scenes played out against the backdrop of smoky pubs because Mr Farage had lifted the smoking ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Archive footage was used to portray Mr Farage, his Deputy Prime Minister - former Tory MP Neil Hamilton - and Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom, who was seen repeating his infamous remark about Africa being 'bongo bongo land'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Border guards were also seen forcibly repatriating illegal immigrants amid race riots, as the UK prepared to pull out of the European Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The film showed Ukip winning a slim majority in May's Election, but within three months, society was on the brink of collapse under Mr Farage's Right-wing policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Weaved into the plot were references to some of the many racism and sexism scandals which have hit the party in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Mr Farage was initially invited to discuss the scenario in a Channel 4 interview with Jeremy Paxman, but negotiations broke down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>A Channel 4 spokesman defended the film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>He said: 'The rise of Ukip's electoral support and their prominence in opinion polls is the political phenomenon of recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>'This is a timely and innovative exploration of the effect their policies might have on Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>'As a public service broadcaster, we will comply with Ofcom rules on due impartiality within the programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>But a Ukip official said: 'The idea that this is what would happen is simply preposterous, but it shows that we have got the liberal establishment quaking.</td></tr>
