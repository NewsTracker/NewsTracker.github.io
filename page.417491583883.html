<h3>What next for the 7 men detained in the FIFA raids in Zurich</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ZURICH (AP) " One week after an American investigation of soccer corruption erupted at FIFA, seven men remain detained in Zurich prison cells.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The seven officials " including two FIFA vice presidents, one member-elect of the FIFA executive committee and one FIFA staffer " were arrested in early morning hotel raids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>All face extradition to the United States in a process which could last months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Only then could they be questioned about involvement in alleged racketeering, money-laundering and wire fraud in a $150 million bribe scheme spanning more than two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The seven in Zurich have until next Monday to appeal being detained by Swiss authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Their best chance of being released on bail lies with their lawyers either finding flaws in how American and Swiss agencies processed and handled the arrests, or a lenient judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Release on bail is possible, but it's very, very rare," said Folco Galli, spokesman for the Swiss Federal Office of Justice in Bern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The next deadline in the Swiss extradition process is July 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.S. must submit its formal extradition request by then and may be in no hurry to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We will publish a press release as soon as these requests have been submitted," Galli said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Swiss justice office will examine the merits of each request and likely issue an extradition order within a month or two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>One condition is that the allegations each faces in the U.S. would also be punishable in Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Swiss authorities will not have an opinion on the likely guilt or innocence of each detainee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That is for the American courts to decide, Galli said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>An order granted can be appealed to the Swiss Criminal Court in Bellinzona, in the Italian-border canton (state) of Ticino.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A further appeal route goes to the Swiss Federal Tribunal in Lausanne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That whole process could last at least six months, depending on how much resistance is put up by the seven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The outgoing FIFA president will not be detained in his home country on behalf of American prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As a Swiss national, Blatter cannot be extradited by Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>FIFA tournaments are being played this month in New Zealand and Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Under normal circumstances, FIFA protocol would require Blatter to attend the Under-20 World Cup final in Auckland on June 20 and the Women's World Cup final on July 5 in Vancouver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>FIFA said Wednesday that Blatter does not have any confirmed travel plans in the next two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In a separate case, Swiss federal authorities are looking at possible criminal mismanagement and money-laundering in FIFA's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Swiss police last week questioned some of the 10 non-Swiss residents who voted in the process and still held their FIFA seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>On Wednesday, the Swiss attorney general's office said it could not confirm which of the 10 were spoken to as "persons providing information."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>One voter who claims not to have been spoken to is FIFA senior vice president Issa Hayatou of Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Hayatou, the Confederation of African Football president, told media in his home country this week that no authorities approached him in Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"His announced resignation will have no influence on the ongoing criminal proceedings," the attorney general's office said.</td></tr>
