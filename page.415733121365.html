<h3>Yankees extend reign as most valuable, Blue Jays 22nd -- Forbes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 27-time World Series champion Yankees were valued at $3.2 billion, a 28% jump from last year and comfortably above the second-ranked Los Angeles Dodgers, whose value rose 20% to $2.4 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The average MLB team is now worth $1.2 billion, a 48% spike from last year, which Forbes attributed to richer national broadcasting deals and higher overall profitability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Yankees, who last year missed the playoffs for only the third time since 1994 yet saw their revenue rise 10% to an MLB-high $508 million, have topped the list since Forbes began tracking MLB team valuations in 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Boston Red Sox ($2.1 billion), World Series champion San Francisco Giants ($2 billion) and Chicago Cubs ($1.8 billion) rounded out the top five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Toronto Blue Jays, who have the longest playoff drought at 21 seasons, were valued at $870 million in 22nd spot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The two Florida franchises, Miami Marlins ($650 million) and Tampa Bay Rays ($625 million), were at the bottom of the list in 29th and 30th respectively.</td></tr>
