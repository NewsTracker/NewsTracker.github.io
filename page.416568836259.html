<h3>James Holmes' Colorado theater shooting jurors weep at photos of victims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jurors in Colorado sobbed at the sight victims' photographs on the first day of James Holmes' murder trial as District Attorney George Brauchler said in his opening statement that the gunman entered the Aurora movie theater in 2013 with the intent to murder as many people as possible to make himself feel better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The remarks by Brauchler marked the start of a long-awaited, lengthy and emotionally wrenching trial to determine if he'll be executed, spend his life in prison, or be committed to an institution as criminally insane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Holmes, 27, pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to 166 counts, including first-degree murder, attempted murder and an explosives offense, after the mayhem he caused in suburban Denver on July 20, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It remains one of America's deadliest shootings, and that Holmes was the lone gunman has never been in doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was arrested at the scene, along with an arsenal of weapons on his body and in his car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His fate depends on whether a jury agrees that he was unable to know right from wrong because of a mental illness or defect three years ago, when he slipped into the midnight Batman premiere, unleashed tear gas and marched up and down the aisles, firing at people who tried to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'Through this door is horror.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Through this door are bullets, blood, brains and bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Through this door, one guy who thought as if he had lost his career, lost his love life, lost his purpose, came to execute a plan,' said Brauchler, standing before a scale model of the theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'Four-hundred people came into a boxlike theater to be entertained, and one person came to slaughter them,' the prosecutor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Brauchler immediately went on the offensive, challenging the defense's insanity claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The prosecutor declared that two separate mental health evaluations carried out by forensic psychiatrists found James Holmes to be sane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was the first public word on what different psychiatrists determined after examining the former neuroscience student.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'Both of them said the same thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That guy was sane,' said Brauchler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Citing the results of two exams administered to Holmes, including a full IQ text, the prosecutor said that psychiatrists have concluded that the promising neuroscience graduate student at the University of Colorado School of Medicine has a superior intellect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'He is smart,' Brauchler said of Holmes calmly sitting at the defense table in front of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Relying on a large TV screen hanging on the wall opposite the jury box to present snippets of evidence, including passages from Holmes' journal and clips from videotaped interviews with the suspect, George Brauchler methodically detailed how the aspiring researcher spiraled out of control over the course of a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Quoting from transcripts of Holmes' text message and email exchanges with his parents and his ex- girlfriend, Brauchler described a socially awkward, uncommunicative man who was struggling with his studies and had his heart broken by his first love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Brauchler also quoted extensively from Holmes' journal, referred to as 'the notebook,' in which the defendant started meticulously planning a mass shooting back in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In his diary, Brauchler said Holmes talked about his long-standing hatred of mankind and laid out his plan to attack a movie theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The prosecutor said early on, Holmes ruled out an attack at an airport because he did not want to be associated with terrorism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>After setting his heart on a movie theater just 4 miles from his home, Holmes drew detailed maps to pick the perfect theater at the multiplex: some had too many exits, others had too few.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Eventually, he narrowed it down to theaters 9 and 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He then began buying up weapons, additional magazines and enough body armor to cover himself from head to toe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A month before the massacre, Holmes drove several times to a remote, unsupervised gun range to practice firing weapons, including on moving targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In preparation for the mass killing, Holmes dyed his hair red and purchased contact lenses to make his pupils look bigger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He would later tell a psychiatrist that he changed his appearance so he would be remembered because someone who looks different stand out more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He noted that the hue of his hair had nothing to do with the character of Joker from the Batman franchise, as initially thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Prosecutor Brauchler described for the jurors how each victim was killed in the theater at the hands of James Holmes and showed them poster-size images of the casualties, leaving some of them in tears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Inside the silent courtroom, the district attorney detailed how Holmes fired on men, women and children, including 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan who was struck four times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Brauchler said he would show a photo of Moser's body later in the trial, but didn't show it during opening statements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He said they should only have to look at that photo once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Holmes watched the screen with the photographs but showed no visible reaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>There was a box of tissues at the feet of Holmes' parents but they didn't use them during the opening statements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Defense attorneys were beginning their opening statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Brauchler described how Holmes shot some people in the head and face, riddled others with multiple bullets and hunted down those who tried to escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>'I shot at people trying to get away,' Brauchler quoted Holmes as telling a psychiatrist after the fact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>But according to DA Brauchler, that tragic night in July had a silver lining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>'The greatest mass murder in our memory was intended to be far worse but four providential things kept that from happening,' Brauchler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>One was a neighbor who decided not to open the door of Holmes' apartment filled with booby traps where a stereo was blasting and call the police instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The second was the fact that Holmes 'fumbled' one of the two canisters of tear gas used inside the theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>A jammed rifle was the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The fourth providential thing, Brauchner noted, were the 'heroes' who rushed to the rescue of the victims in the blood-spattered theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Brauchler concluded his emotional two-hour presentation, interspersed with personal stories of each of the 12 slain theater goers, with an impassioned plea addressed to the men and women of the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Holmes, 27, appeared calm throughout the prosecutor's opening statement on Day 1 of a trial to determine if he'll be executed, spend his life in prison, or be committed to an institution as criminally insane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>His clown-like red hair grew out long ago, and the bushy beard he wore before the trial was gone, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Instead, Holmes appeared with a neat haircut and trimmed beard, wearing a button-down shirt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Discreetly, so that others can't see, Holmes was restrained by a harness under his light-blue shirt and khaki pants, tethered to the floor of the courtroom where his trial is expected to take months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>His fate depends on what the jury learns about his mental state three years ago, when he slipped into a midnight Batman premiere, unleashed tear gas and marched up and down the aisles, firing at people who tried to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Holmes acknowledges killing 12 people and wounding 70 more inside the packed theater, but has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>At around noon Monday, Judge Carlos Samour Jr, addressed the jury, explaining what will be expected of them and detailing what will happen during the course of the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Before issuing the instructions, the presiding judge told the 12 jurors, plus 12 alternates, he has ordered the media not to identify them by name or contact them or their friends or family members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Judge Samour reminded the jurors tasked with deciding Holmes' fate that the burden lies on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the gunman was sane during the commission of the crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The 24 people will not know if they are jurors or alternates until deliberations are about to begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>At that point, the remaining alternates will be dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Prosecutors were to spend two hours making their opening arguments on the first day of the trial proper, before a presentation of the same length by public defenders Daniel King and Katherine Spengler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>The defense on Monday was still fighting the judge's decision to let the jury see girsly images of the crime scene, including a 90-minute silent video of the inside of the theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Witnesses said Holmes threw smoke bomb-type devices before opening fire randomly with weapons, including an AR-15 military-style rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and a .40-caliber pistol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Unlike most other states, Colorado puts the burden on prosecutors, who must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Holmes was sane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Colorado has already spent millions seeking that verdict, managing an outsized number of victims, witnesses and more than 85,000 pages of evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Experts say Holmes faces long odds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Insanity defenses are successful in only 25 per cent of felony trials nationally, even less so in homicides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>'Lay people tend to think of people with mental illness as extremely dangerous, and that also influences jurors, especially if someone has killed someone,' said Christopher Slobogin, who teaches law and psychiatry at Vanderbilt Law School.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Winning a trial on mental-health grounds is rare, but then again, so are jury trials for mass shooters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Most are killed by police, kill themselves or plead guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Signature look: In this July 23, 2012 file photo, James Holmes sits in Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colorado.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Just one won a mental-health case in the last two decades, Duwe said: Michael Hayes, who shot nine people, killing four, in North Carolina in 1988.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Based on that, Holmes 'faces some pretty long odds,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Holmes was arrested almost immediately, while stripping off his body armor in the parking lot outside the Century 16 movie theater where he replaced Hollywood violence with real human carnage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>His victims included a 6-year-old girl, two active-duty servicemen, a single mom and an aspiring broadcaster who had survived a mall shooting in Toronto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Several died shielding friends or loved ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Nearly three years passed as both sides filed hundreds of motions in legal debates over capital punishment and insanity pleas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Prosecutors will argue that the once-promising doctoral candidate in neuroscience plotted and planned for months, amassing guns, ammunition, tear gas grenades and enough chemicals to turn his dingy apartment into a potentially lethal booby trap that could have caused even more carnage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>They'll ask jurors to find him guilty, and if so, sentence him to death rather than life without parole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>If jurors decide instead that Holmes was insane at the time of the shooting, he would be committed indefinitely to a state psychiatric hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Dueling mental health evaluations could influence their deliberations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. ordered a second exam after prosecutors said the first was biased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Defense attorneys have objected to the results of the second one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Holmes faces 166 counts, including first-degree murder, attempted murder and an explosives offense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>It took nearly two hours for the judge - who is presiding over his first death penalty trial - to reach each charge, naming each victim, out loud during a pretrial hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Holmes' trial could take at least four months or more and is sure to be emotionally wrenching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>The 12 jurors and 12 alternates - chosen from a pool of 9,000 because it was so difficult to find people who weren't personally affected - won't know if they'll join the deliberations until after the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Some survivors want Holmes executed, even if that means reliving horrific details.</td></tr>
