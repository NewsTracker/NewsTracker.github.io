<h3>Islamic State may be harvesting organs, Iraq envoy to U.N. says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have bodies. Come and examine them," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It is clear they are missing certain parts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also said a dozen doctors have been "executed" in Mosul, the largest Islamic State-controlled city in Iraq, for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of "crimes of genocide" in targeting certain ethnic groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that "it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>ISIL is an acronym for the jihadi group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Shariah law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control," Mladenov said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Elsewhere, Human Rights Watch has called the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians by an Islamic State group affiliate in Libya a war crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The New York-based international organization called Tuesday on Libya and the United Nations to catch and prosecute the militants who published a video of the beheadings on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It called in a statement for the U.N. to create an investigative mechanism or appoint a special rapporteur for Libya, and for the International Criminal Court to examine the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The watchdog said the murder of civilians by combatants in an armed conflict is a war crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It says Coptic Christians have been targeted by militants in Libya as they carry goods from Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At least three Libyan groups have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group over the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The beheadings of the 21 Egyptians prompted Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to order his nation's air force to bomb Islamic State targets in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In an interview aired Tuesday, el-Sissi also called for a United Nations resolution mandating an international coalition to intervene in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There is no other choice, taking into account the agreement of the Libyan people and government and that they call on us to act," he told France's Europe 1 radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We have to work together to defeat terrorism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>El-Sissi said a 2011 NATO operation, which played a critical role in toppling former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, was an "unfinished mission."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Western alliance imposed a no-fly zone on Libya and used air power to try to prevent Gadhafi's forces attacking civilian areas held by rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But it then did little to prevent the country sliding into anarchy and chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We abandoned the Libyan people as prisoners to extremist militias," the Egyptian president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting on Wednesday on the situation in Libya, Egypt's foreign minister met Tuesday with ambassadors from the council's five veto-wielding powers - the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki noted the U.N. meeting and said, "Obviously, we all have a concern about the threat of (the Islamic State group) and there will be a range of proposals put out there, but we're not going to get ahead of any process."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The United States, Italy, France, Britain, Spain and Germany issued a statement on Tuesday saying a U.N.-led process to establish a national unity government in Libya provided the best hope for confronting the country's violence and instability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Libya is separated from the Italian island of Sicily by only a few hundred kilometers of sea, and has been the launch point in recent years for hundreds of thousands of African and Middle East migrants seeking a better life in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti have both said Rome would be ready to join any military intervention, but Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has struck a more cautious note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>El-Sissi urged the outside world to send weapons to Libya's internationally recognized government, which is based in the eastern city of Bayda after rivals seized power in Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Bayda government has also asked for the lifting of an arms embargo to help it take back control of the country.</td></tr>
