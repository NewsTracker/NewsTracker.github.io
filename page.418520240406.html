<h3>Greece needs debt relief far beyond EU plans: secret IMF report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A pedestrian walks through empty streets by a mural in Athens, Greece July 12, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(Reuters) - Greece will need debt relief far beyond what euro zone partners have been prepared to consider due to the devastation of its economy and banks in the last two weeks, a confidential study by the International Monetary Fund seen by Reuters shows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The updated debt sustainability analysis was sent to euro zone governments late on Monday, hours after Athens and its 18 partners agreed in principle to open negotiations on a third bailout programme of up to 86 billion euros in return for tougher austerity measures and structural reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability points to the need for debt relief on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date - and what has been proposed by the ESM," the IMF said, referring to the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>European countries would have to give Greece a 30-year grace period on servicing all its European debt, including new loans, and a very dramatic maturity extension, or else make explicit annual fiscal transfers to the Greek budget or accept "deep upfront haircuts" on their loans to Athens, the report said.</td></tr>
