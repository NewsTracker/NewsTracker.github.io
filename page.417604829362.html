<h3>'It's happening tomorrow': Sony Music CEO confirms Apple streaming service</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook now seems certain to unveil a new streaming service at WWDC on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ever since Apple paid $US3 billion ($3.8 million) for music company Beats, analysts and fans alike have been waiting to see the fruits of that purchase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Most have predicted a fully fledged subscription streaming service from Apple to rival the likes of Spotify and Pandora.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Now it seems a man integral to the operation of such a service has outed its launch a day ahead of the announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's happening tomorrow," Sony chief executive Doug Morris told an audience at the Midem music conference in Cannes, according to VentureBeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Tomorrow" refers to Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, taking place in San Francisco on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Morris, who has a long history with Beats co-founder and Apple music boss Jimmy , did not detail the service but predicted it would facilitate a mainstream shift towards music streaming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He also mentioned his strong preference for subscription streaming services over those that were free but served ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"[Apple has] $US178 billion in the bank. And they have 800 million credit cards in iTunes", Mr Morris said, pointing out the competitive advantage the iPhone maker will have over its streaming rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Spotify has never really advertised, because it's never been profitable. My guess is that Apple will promote this like crazy and I think that will have a halo effect on the streaming business".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Reports sayApple customers in the US are likely to be charged $US10 ($13.10) a month for the streaming service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If the service was baked into the upcoming iOS 9 software update as part of iTunes, and offered initially as a free trial, it would guarantee Apple hundreds of millions of customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Of course, the imposition could also spark a user backlash akin to the one Apple suffered last September, when it sent free copies of a U2 album automatically to all iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The company has reportedly been approaching big-name artists, including Taylor Swift, to sign up to guest DJ on a revamped iTunes Radio service, or enter into exclusive streaming partnerships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>All will be revealed at the conference, which begins at 3am on Tuesday, AEST.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'It's happening tomorrow': Sony Music CEO...</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>iOS 9 will make your iPhone run smoother, be more...</td></tr>
