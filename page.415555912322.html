<h3>Netanyahu Surges to Victory in Israeli Vote</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Wednesday, March 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Exit polls from Israel's national elections showed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party nearly deadlocked with Isaac Herzog's center-left Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's strong showing in national elections this week has come with a price: He has managed to antagonize friends and foes alike with hard-line rhetoric on the campaign trail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While the tough talk gave Netanyahu a last-minute boost in the polls, the Israeli leader could now face a difficult task convincing an already skeptical world that he is serious about reaching peace with his Arab neighbors - particularly if, as expected, he forms a new government comprised of religious and nationalistic parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Trailing in opinion polls, Netanyahu took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign to shore up support among his core nationalistic constituency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He vowed to increase settlement construction in east Jerusalem, the Palestinians' would-be capital, and rejected the idea of a Palestinian state in current conditions - putting him at odds with U.S. and European positions and reversing his own policy of the past six years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a last-ditch attempt to spur his supporters to the polls Tuesday, he warned that Arab citizens were voting "in droves" and endangering years of rule by his Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The comments drew accusations of racism from Israeli Arabs and a White House rebuke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Washington, the Obama administration said Wednesday that it was "deeply concerned" by the divisive language used by the Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest also said the U.S. would have to rethink the best way to bring about a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - a cornerstone of U.S. Mideast policy for years - after Netanyahu rejected the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Based on those comments, the U.S. will evaluate our position going forward," Earnest told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One on a flight to Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said Secretary of State John Kerry had called Netanyahu to congratulate him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But she refused to describe the conversation as "warm" or friendly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Netanyahu's controversial stance appears to have paid off at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Thought to be in danger of being voted out of office just a few days ago, the Likud emerged as the largest party in parliament when near-final results trickled in Wednesday, leaving it in position to lead the next coalition government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But the comments may have reinforced a belief in many world capitals that Netanyahu isn't serious about peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Dore Gold, a confidant and unofficial adviser to Netanyahu, said he was confident the prime minister could repair the relationship with the U.S., Israel's closest and most important ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The U.S. and Israel have had very sharp disagreements in the past about different aspects of Mideast policy but have usually been able to overcome the differences," Gold said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I suspect that is exactly what is going to happen this time as well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Gold declined to speculate on what Netanyahu might do, saying only that he is a masterful diplomat who knows "exactly how to address the U.S.-Israel relationship in a positive way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Elliot Abrams, a former adviser on Mideast policy to President George W. Bush, dismissed Netanyahu's campaign tactics as "hot rhetoric."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I'm not sure they give us much insight into how he's going to govern," Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, told a briefing for reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Likud led the election by capturing 30 seats in the 120-member parliament, according to near-final results released Wednesday.</td></tr>
