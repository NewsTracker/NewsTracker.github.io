<h3>What to expect from Zuckerberg at Facebook's F8</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This year the developer conference will be about just how broad and wide-reaching Facebook's family of products has become.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a sign of Zuckerberg's commitment to his strategy of building out a portfolio of apps, it's also featuring speakers and giving updates on Oculus, WhatsApp, LIveRail, Parse and Instagram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For the first time the conference will be two days instead of one, with more than 2,000 developers coming in from around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Here are some key topics that could make headlines-game changers for developers, and potentially investors as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>1) Ad tech will be in the spotlight; Facebook could launch a new mobile ad platform to compete directly with Twitter's MoPub.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last year Facebook acquired start-up LiveRail, a tool for publishers to sell video ad space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There's been a lot of speculation that it would be a natural extension for LiveRail to start auctioning off ad space for other companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That would put it in direct competition with Twitter's MoPub as well as Google's ad exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This would effectively allow Facebook's technology to own the entire life cycle of the ad-buying process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In addition to buying ads on Facebook and measuring their impact with Facebook's Atlas, marketers could buy across the Web through LiveRail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The big keynote Thursday is about virtual reality and Facebook's Oculus platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The key question there is whether the company will provide any updates on when the platform will be ready to hit the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Facebook is in talks with several media organizations to host articles within the social network, according to the New York Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On the heels of announcing the ability to send money to friends through Messenger, we could hear more about Facebook's plans to turn the app into a more of a platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In addition to enhancing the instant messaging with more info about callers, Facebook could also introduce ways to incorporate news and other content or services into the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Facebook has been making a big push for video content companies, like Buzzfeed, to publish videos directly into Facebook's video player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Now we could hear details on plans to integrate news content directly into Facebook, instead of making users click outside the site to NYTimes.com or BuzzFeed.com to finish an article.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The New York Times laid out this proposition in an article published Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The question is how Facebook lures publishers over to its site-and what kind of ad revenue split, or promotion it promises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Facebook will have to make it worth publishers' while to justify ceding control of the user experience, and their ownership over ad and subscription revenue.</td></tr>
