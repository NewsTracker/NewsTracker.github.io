<h3>Ian McKellen works his wizardry as a 93-year-old Sherlock in ‘Mr. Holmes’</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hattie Morahan and Sir Ian McKellen in "Mr. Holmes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bill Condon's "Mr. Holmes" is a delightful if somewhat minor addition to the supersleuth's ever-growing film and TV canon, providing a smashing role for Ian McKellen as a 93-year-old Sherlock trying to solve his final mystery in post-World War II England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>What prompted our elderly hero to abandon detecting and exile himself to England's Sussex coast 30 years before?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That's a mystery to Holmes himself, who hopes to reverse memory loss by consuming royal honey from his own bees - and prickly ash, another possible cure he's procured during a mysterious recent trip to Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As his time runs down, Sherlock finds an ally in Roger (Milo Parker), the bright 14-year-old son of his gruff, widowed housekeeper (Laura Linney).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Roger becomes hooked on the puzzle after sneaking a peek at Holmes' incomplete manuscript on his last case, which the great young detective deduces must have ended disastrously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In slowly unfolding flashbacks to 30 years ago, we see a 63-year-old Sherlock following the depressed wife (Hattie Morahan) of a client who fears she's fallen under the influence of a spiritualist (Frances de la Tour), who's giving her lessons on playing the glass harmonica.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That mystery is ultimately less satisfying than the plight of the elderly Sherlock, who's struggling simultaneously with the indignities of old age and the possibility of losing his long-suffering maid to another job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His memory may be faulty, but he's still capable of breathtaking deductive leaps when necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Mr. Holmes" is very much a companion piece to Condon's 1998 film "Gods and Monsters," in which McKellen played dying director James Whale, whose memories of directing "Frankenstein'' are jogged after meeting a younger man he desires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That film won Condon an Oscar for adapted screenplay and netted McKellen an Oscar nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Mr. Holmes,'' derived from a novel by Mitch Cullin, isn't quite as deep or as poignant, but amply rewards McKellen and Holmes fans willing to go with its leisurely pace.</td></tr>
