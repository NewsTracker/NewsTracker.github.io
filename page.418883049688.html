<h3>Baltimore boy gets historic double-hand transplant</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For the first time in Zion Harvey's life, he'll be able to throw a football with two hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Earlier this month the 8-year-old Baltimore boy underwent a medical milestone, becoming the first child in the world to receive a double-hand transplant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That historical accomplishment followed a 10-hour surgery at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where a donor's hands and forearms were attached to his limbs through tiny blood vessels, bones, nerve muscles and skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I just felt like he was being reborn," his mother, Pattie Ray, told NBC News of the incredible result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The highly-complex surgery, undertaken by a 40-member transplant team, followed Zion growing up for most of his life not only without hands but legs as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When he was just 2-years old, he underwent a quadruple amputation after suffering a life-threatening infection in his bloodstream that caused multi-organ failure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He spent years on dialysis until - at age 4 - he was given a kidney from his mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One thing he said he still longed to do, however: throw a football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>During an appointment for possible prosthetics, Zion's mom said they were surprised when doctors suggested he get hands instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Zion was found eligible for the transplant thanks to him already taking drugs for his past kidney transplant, which would prevent his body from rejecting a new organ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It was Zion's decision," Ray told the Baltimore Sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If he wanted them we were going to get them. If he didn't we weren't."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Zion, when asked, was in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While waiting for a donor match, Zion's doctors practiced the exact procedure on cadavers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When the surgery finally took place they then connected his forearm's bones to the donor's with steel plates and screws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The arteries and veins were then joined before blood was permitted to flow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Each muscle and tendon was then rejoined followed by the nerves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dr. L. Scott Levin, director of the Hand Transplantation Program at the children's hospital, recalled watching Zion's new hand turn pink from the successful blood flow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"That hand was now alive," he told NBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"That became, instantly, part of Zion's circulation, no different than my hand or your hand."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Zion is now recovering from the surgery, something that is expected to take several months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>His recovery includes visits with occupational therapist multiple times per day to practice moving his new hands, something he can't yet do without their help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some of the first things he said he looks forward to doing are throwing a football, climbing on the monkey bars and playing with his little sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"My favorite thing (will be to) wait for her to run into my hands as I pick her up and spin her around," he told NBC News.</td></tr>
