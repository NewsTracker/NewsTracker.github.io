<h3>Greek anti-austerity protesters hold finance ministry sit-in</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) " Greek left-wing demonstrators are staging a sit-in at the finance ministry building in central Athens, in a protest against the radical, left-led government, which they accuse of planning new austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Communist Party-affiliated protesters draped a large banner over the facade of the building, which is opposite Parliament, reading "We have bled enough, we have paid enough."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Thursday's protest came as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is engaged in a diplomatic offensive in Brussels to try to persuade European creditors to pay out the bailout loans the country needs to avoid default.</td></tr>
