<h3>Bail Set at $25 Million for 'Suge' Knight in Murder Case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Los Angeles prosecutors are asking a judge to set bail in a murder case against the former rap music mogul Knight at $25 million citing his violent history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The motion filed by Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes on Thursday, March 19, 2015, cites 31 incidents in which Knight is accused of threatening others or using violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Former rap music mogul Marion "Suge" Knight collapsed in a courtroom Friday shortly after a judge ordered him held on $25 million bail in a murder case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Bailiffs cleared the courtroom, paramedics arrived with a stretcher a few minutes later and an ambulance was seen leaving the courthouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Defense attorney Matthew Fletcher said Knight was unconscious when the lawyer left the courtroom and an update on his condition was not immediately available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fletcher said his client, who is diabetic and has a blood clot, previously told him that he hadn't received any medication since Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Knight hit his head on a chair when he fell after the bail hearing, Fletcher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 6-foot-4-inch tall Knight collapsed while deputies were bringing him back into the courtroom after Fletcher asked a judge to order that Knight be given his medication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The attorney said Knight was being kept in solitary confinement in jail without proper access to medication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He's being treated worse than Charles Manson," Fletcher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The collapse marked the fourth time that Knight has been taken by ambulance from a courthouse since he was charged with killing Terry Carter, 55, in early February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen set bail on Friday at $25 million for Knight, who is accused of running down and killing Carter with his truck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Coen made his decision after Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes noted that Knight was on bail in a robbery case when he struck Carter and another man in a parking lot in Compton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"He escalated his behavior and committed murder," Barnes told the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fletcher argued that Knight's bail should be set at $2 million, but Coen said the higher amount was warranted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The attorney said before the hearing that his client likely could not post bail if it was set at $25 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Knight, the 49-year-old co-founder of Death Row Records, has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Barnes filed a motion Thursday accusing Knight of being part of a scheme that has extorted more than $10 million from up-and-coming and established rappers in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Fletcher countered that prosecutors should file charges involving those extortion claims if they have enough evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Fletcher also said phone records and other evidence in the murder case would show that Knight was lured to the location where the men were hit by the truck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Knight was attacked when he arrived and hit the two men while trying to flee the scene, the lawyer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Fletcher said Cle "Bone" Sloan acknowledged to sheriff's investigators that he attacked Knight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The attorney argued his client wasn't required to remain at the scene and endure the attack, and that Sloan should be charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"If his name wasn't 'Suge' Knight, they wouldn't have filed this case," Fletcher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Knight was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, his label once listing Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy.</td></tr>
