<h3>Hesitant witness, fuzzy video: Hurdles in 'Suge' Knight case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Knight will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges after the former rap music mogul struck two men with his pickup truck in January, killing one and seriously injuring the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen made the ruling Thursday after concluding a hearing that focused heavily on testimony from Cle "Bone" Sloan, who was hit outside a Compton burger stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The judge also reduced bail from $25 million to $10 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) - On paper, the evidence in the murder case against Marion "Suge" Knight appears strong: Prosecutors have a surviving witness, video of the former rap music mogul running over two men and Knight's history of violence and intimidation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yet a hearing this week that ended with a judge ordering Knight to stand trial showed the difficulty prosecutors will face if they hope to convict the Death Row Records co-founder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The witness says he doesn't want to testify and be labeled a "snitch" and won't even identify Knight as the one who ran over him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The video is fuzzy and has elements that could help either side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And Knight is not the only one involved with a shady past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Experts say witness issues are common in prosecutions involving gang members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Cle "Bone" Sloan, the man who survived being run over, is a former gang member and Knight has ties to the Mob Piru Bloods, a gang that helped him maintain a fearsome image during the heyday of Death Row Records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sloan made clear that he is a reluctant witness, telling a prosecutor earlier this week he didn't want to be a snitch and refusing to identify Knight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Meanwhile, Knight's defense attorney used the video to show that several men with gang affiliations who Sloan hired for work on the film "Straight Outta Compton" were at the scene, when they should have been several blocks away preparing to shoot a promo video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Such behavior is common in cases involving gang members, in large part because testimony can mean physical harm or death for someone seen as a snitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"That is the hallmark of a gang case," said Alan Jackson, a former Los Angeles prosecutor who has written guidelines used nationwide in gang prosecutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Although it's a very daunting situation to be confronted with, it's one that can be overcome," Jackson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's usually overcome by the prosecutor explaining to the jury through a gang expert what these rules of the street are."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Video of Knight running over Sloan and Terry Carter could be used by both sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While the footage shows Knight's truck barreling over Carter, it offers a limited view of the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Knight's attorney Matt Fletcher has contended that Sloan was carrying a gun - the video shows one of Sloan's associates taking something off him after he was hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But a prosecutor implied during this week's hearing that it could have been a radio used by Sloan during the film shoot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Fletcher said Thursday that testimony from the hearing ruled out that it was a radio, cellphone or wallet that was taken off Sloan by an associate after he was hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We eliminated all the possibilities but the last remaining possibility which is the gun," Fletcher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"You never quite know what's going to happen with a video," said Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He noted that defense lawyers slowed down and painstakingly analyzed footage of Los Angeles police beating motorist Rodney King, successfully winning acquittal of the officers in a state criminal trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Convictions against two of the officers were later obtained through a separate federal case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Knight, 49, was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He has prior felony convictions for armed robbery and assault with a gun.</td></tr>
