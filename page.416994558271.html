<h3>Hillary Clinton woos donors visiting campaign headquarters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton is wooing an early group of major donors to her presidential campaign and visiting her Brooklyn campaign headquarters for the first time since getting into the White House race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hundreds of people who have raised at least $2,700 for Clinton's campaign received a series of briefings Thursday on polling, strategy and communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lunch was not included on their itinerary, part of an effort by campaign manager Robby Mook to demonstrate the campaign's frugal style to the people who will pay for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After the donors left, Clinton spent an hour mingling with the low-level staff who have recently joined her operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Next week, Clinton will return to more politically competitive terrain, with stops planned in Iowa and New Hampshire.</td></tr>
