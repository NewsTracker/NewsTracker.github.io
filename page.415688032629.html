<tr><td>10</td><td>The exact procedure Ms Sarmonikas was undergoing is not known, however the statement hints that Ms Sarmonikas, who was "filled with certain inadequacies" about her body, may have been undergoing cosmetic surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The family said the only response they had received from the hospital was to say Ms Sarmonikas had signed a waiver before surgery, which released them of any liability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There have been no answers and their only offer of 'co-operation' was an urgency to return her to us in the form of ashes," the family's statement says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The Australian embassy has strongly advised we do not allow this to happen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They are now frantically trying to raise funds so Ms Sarmonikas' sister, Andrea, and mother can travel to Mexico to bring her body home to Australia.</td></tr>

We are all born into family. Sometimes, we get to choose it. Rest now in eternal peace, my sister. I was truly blessed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ms Sarmonikas was a former school captain at Coombabah High School on the Gold Coast, and also worked as a receptionist at real estate company LJ Hooker in Surfers Paradise.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>Thousands of Australians are thought to travel overseas, often to Thailand, each year to undergo surgical procedures at a cheaper rate than in Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Stephen Parnis, urged those people to ask themselves: "What price is one's health?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"In general terms, we are concerned about the numbers of Australians heading overseas for medical procedures, and that's because we feel on balance that the risks significantly outweigh any potential benefits," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Dr Parnis said he could not comment specifically on Ms Sarmonikas' case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But as a Melbourne emergency physician, he had seen first-hand the complications that could arise when patients returned to Australia after undergoing surgery overseas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Some of those patients he had treated were very sick, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We have a system here which is subject to very rigorous scrutiny, and also has among the world's best outcomes, whether it's medical or surgical care," Dr Parnis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We can vouch for our services. We don't want to cast aspersions or doubts about our colleagues overseas, but we can't vouch for the standards that are in another part of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"If you have a surgical procedure, you really need to have the involvement of the surgical team before, during and after the procedure. If you have your procedure in another country, that clearly can't occur if you return to Australia, and it is not uncommon for Australian doctors to have to try to deal with complications that occur from procedures overseas. That has a number of issues, because the documentation is often inadequate. If it's, say, an infection, you've got a greater chance of having a superbug, a multi-resistant organism, because they are an even bigger problem overseas than they are in Australia."</td></tr>
