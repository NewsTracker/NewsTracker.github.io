<h3>Kerry in Russia to discuss conflicts with Putin</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin with an eye on easing badly strained relations over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kerry flew to the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday for the highest-level US visit to Russia in two years, to discuss issues including the Iran nuclear talks, Yemen and Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With relations between the two countries at their lowest level since the Cold War, the trip appeared designed as much to maintain contact as anything else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's important for us to keep these lines of communication open. It's important to try to talk to the senior decision-maker," said a senior US state department official who briefed reporters travelling with Kerry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We have a lot of business that we could do together if there is interest," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, welcomed the meeting as a positive step.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Through dialogue, it is possible to find ways for a normalisation - closer coordination in dealing with international problems," Peskov told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But he added: "Russia was never the initiator of this cooling of relations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kerry is also expected to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov while in Sochi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Relations between Washington and Moscow have sunk since Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula in March of last year and backed pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Moscow accuses Washington of orchestrating last year's overthrow of a Ukrainian president who was backed by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The US has accused Russia of failing to withdraw heavy equipment such as air defence systems, tanks and artillery from eastern Ukraine in violation of a peace plan agreed in February and known as Minsk 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Russia denies Western and Ukrainian accusations that it is arming the pro-Russian separatists battling the government and supporting them with its own military forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>More than 6,100 people have been killed since April 2014 in the Ukraine crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Arrival of 300 US Army soldiers to train Ukraine's national guard sparks warnings by Russia of escalation in conflict.</td></tr>
