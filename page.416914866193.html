<tr><td>3</td><td>TORONTO -- The Canadian government says it will again issue visas to people from Liberia, now that the West African country has been declared Ebola free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The World Health Organization announced Saturday that Liberia has gone 42 days without an Ebola infection, a milestone that signals the outbreak in that country is believed to be over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In late October, Canada made the controversial decision to close borders to people from Ebola-affected countries, saying it would not process visa applications from residents and nationals of countries with widespread and persistent or intense Ebola transmission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The policy did not impede the return of Canadian medical personnel or those working for international aid organizations who travelled to Ebola-affected countries to help combat the outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The World Health Organization and experts in global health law criticized the Canadian decision, saying it violated the International Health Regulations, a treaty to which Canada is a signatory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That treaty stipulates that in a global public health emergency, countries shouldn't take actions that impede international trade or travel beyond what the World Health Organization recommends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The WHO had urged countries not to restrict travel to and from the three West African countries at the heart of the outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Canadian officials insisted that because the visa policy did not affect the travel of Canadians helping to contain the outbreak it was not a general ban and therefore did not violate the International Health Regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Canadian visa restrictions still apply to Guinea and Sierra Leone, which are struggling to extinguish Ebola transmission more than a year after this unprecedented outbreak began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Liberia recorded 10,564 cases of Ebola, with 4,716 deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The most recent figures from the WHO put the total for the West African outbreak at 26,628 cases and 11,020 deaths.</td></tr>
