<h3>Iraq struggles with devastation in Tikrit after it was freed from the Islamic State group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Much of Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown and once a bustling city north of Baghdad, now lies in ruins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Islamic State extremists captured it during a blitz last June that also seized large chunks of northern and western Iraq, along with a huge swath of land in neighboring Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After a nearly 10-month Islamic State occupation, it took Iraqi forces and their allies, including Iranian-backed Shiite militias, a month of ferocious street battles to win the city back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They declared victory in Tikrit on Wednesday, and U.S.-led coalition airstrikes also helped turn the tide in the final weeks of the battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Today, the houses that still stand are pocked with bullet holes and Tikrit's streets are lined with potholes where mortars slammed down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The provincial headquarters in the downtown - now adorned with Shiite militia flags in place of the Islamic State group's black banner - is burned from fire and damaged from heavy fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Friday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi warned that the military will start arresting and prosecuting those who loot abandoned Tikrit properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He also urged security forces to quickly ensure that normalcy is restored so that Tikrit's residents, most of whom fled the Islamic State onslaught, can return home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The looting was first reported within hours of the military victory but authorities have refrained from blaming anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A number of human rights organizations have accused the Shiite militias of carrying out revenge attacks on Sunnis in newly-recaptured towns, or destroying their homes so they can never return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some Shiite militias have set up checkpoints on the southern approaches of Tikrit, and stop passing cars to check for looted goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A satellite image of Tikrit, released in February by the United nations, showed that at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Of those, at least 137 were completely destroyed and 241 were severely damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Iraqi offensive to recapture Tikrit also exacerbated previous damage, particularly in the city's southern neighborhoods where clashes were the most intense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>So much about life in Tikrit under the Islamic State group's rule remains unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On the city's outskirts, near Camp Speicher - a base once used by American forces - blood stains are splattered on a wall, next to a window offering a picturesque view of the Tigris River.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to journalists, say a mass grave was found on the camp's grounds with bodies of up to 1,700 Iraqi soldiers killed by the extremists in Tikrit and northern Iraq last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the heart of the city, Iraqi policemen are out in full force, along with explosives experts working to clear remaining roadside bombs and booby traps left behind by the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Evidence of the damage caused by the bombs is everywhere - charred military vehicles and remains of cars bombs have yet to be collected from the city streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But elsewhere, there is little law and order, and the Shiite militias roam Tikrit streets freely, spray-painting their graffiti and slogans on buildings and homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Much remains to be done before Tikrit residents, most of whom are Sunnis, can return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Services such as power and water are yet to be restored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The government says police and local Sunni tribes eventually will be empowered to maintain law and order in Tikrit, and the militias are expected to leave.</td></tr>
