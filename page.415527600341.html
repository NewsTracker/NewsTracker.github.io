<h3>?Apple plans web TV service in fall</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Will Apple Inc. be able to win over cable customers and cord cutters?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Stay tuned for a very special episode to debut this fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple is in talks with networks, including ABC, CBS and Fox, to offer a bare-bones bundle of TV programming on iOS devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing sources close to the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The company will announce its new service in June and launch in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While ABC, CBS and Fox are already in talks, discussions don't include NBCUniversal, for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In addition to its broadcast network, NBCUniversal also oversees channels like USA and Bravo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Why would NBC hold out?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>According to the Journal's sources, a recent fallout between Apple and NBCUniversal may be the reason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple was working on a streaming platform last year with Comcast, NBCUniversal's parent company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple backed out of the partnership once it realized Comcast might be stalling while the cable company developed its own set-top box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It's hard to imagine Apple would launch without NBC, or that NBC would allow other networks to gain an edge while it pouts over the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However, Dish Network recently launched Sling TV without Fox, NBC or Sony content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One of the primary reasons customers stick with cable is for the live action of NFL, NBA, MLB and college sports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The high programming fees for live events have made sports almost impossible to get online without a cable or satellite subscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Apple is already talking to Disney about putting ESPN on its basic bundle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In addition, the networks also carry a significant number of sporting events.</td></tr>
