<h3>Man recalls ?terrifying? carjacking at Boston bombing trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dun Meng testified that he had gone for a drive to relax after a long day at work on April 18, 2013, and had pulled over to check his phone when Tamerlan Tsarnaev tapped on his window, stepped into his car and pulled a gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"He pulled the magazine out of the gun to show me there's bullets in the gun. He told me, 'You know, I'm serious, so don't be stupid,'" Meng, who works at a tech company that develops cell phone apps for ordering food, said in federal court in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"After that, he asked me, 'Do you know the Boston Marathon explosion?' I said, 'Yes, I know.' He asked, 'Do you know who did it?' I said, "No, I don't.' He said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tamerlan, 26, died later that night after he and younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev engaged in a shootout with police in the Boston suburb of Watertown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The surviving Tsarnaev, 21, is accused of killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade bombs at the race's finish line on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev could be sentenced to death if a jury finds him guilty of the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His lawyers opened the trial last week by bluntly admitting that their client had carried out the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They hope to spare him from the death penalty by convincing the jury that the older brother was the driving force behind the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite the admission, Tsarnaev has maintained his official "not guilty" plea, leaving it to federal prosecutors to first prove his guilt before the trial can move on to its second, sentencing phase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Earlier on Thursday, the jury viewed autopsy photos of Sean Collier, a university police officer who prosecutors contend the brothers shot dead shortly before the carjacking, in an unsuccessful effort to steal his gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the first five days of testimony, the full court viewed gruesome photos and video of the injuries caused by the pressure-cooker bombs that ripped through the crowd at the finish line, causing more than a dozen people to lose legs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But U.S. District Judge George O'Toole ordered autopsy photos of Collier, 27, to be shown only to the jury out of respect for his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some jurors could be seen tearing up as they viewed the photos of Collier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The court also viewed pictures of blood pooled in his squad car's cup holders and on its floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Collier's death marked the start of a chaotic 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After Meng escaped the carjacking, when the pair stopped at a gas station, the Tsarnaevs hurled explosives at police during a gunfight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The shooting ended when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev roared off in Meng's Mercedes, running over and killing his brother before disappearing into a drydocked boat in the Boston suburb of Watertown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police found him the next evening, after a day-long lockdown of the Boston area when hundreds of thousands of people hid in their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, and graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, as well as 8-year-old Martin Richard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Meng said the most frightening moment of his carjacking came when he decided to escape while Dzhokhar shopped for snacks at a gas station and Tamerlan fussed with a navigation system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This seems the most terrifying moment, most difficult decision in my life," Meng said, adding that Tamerlan had told him he would not be killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I was struggling, should I trust him about that? Or should I take this chance by myself to run away?"</td></tr>

<h3>Islamic State accepts Boko Haram allegiance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Both groups appear to have suffered setbacks, with IS calling for some fighters to travel to West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A spokesman for "Islamic State" (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Thursday said the self-appoointed caliph accepted Boko Haram's pledge of allegiance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Our caliph, God save him, has accepted the pledge of loyalty of our brothers of Boko Haram so we congratulate Muslims and our jihadi brothers in West Africa," said IS spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Boko Haram has been fighting a six-year insurgency aimed at imposing Muslim Shariah law in Nigeria, and it has recently widened the scope of its operations to include Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the audio message, Adnani called on Muslims who could not join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to enter combat in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Instead, he said, the pledge by Boko Haram had opened a "new door for you to migrate to the land of Islam and fight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Boko Haram pledge to IS came on Saturday, when an audiotape surfaced that was attributed to Boko Haram leader Abubaktar Shekau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We announce our allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims," Shekau said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Boko Haram's violent insurgency has killed more than 13,000 people since 2009, and forced about 1.5 million from their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It appears that Boko Haram has lost territory in recent days, in part thanks to a four-nation military offensive involving Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>IS has attracted thousands of foreign fighters over the past year - many of them from the West - while Boko Haram is struggling to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As Stephen Calabria writes, experts see numerous reasons for the disparity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kurdish Peshmerga are being trained in Germany, honing their weapons and tactical skills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The battle against Islamic State militants in Iraq is a matter of life and death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Wolfgang Dick reports from Hammelburg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Iraqi forces and allies are fighting "Islamic State" (IS) militants for a second day in Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Capturing the northern Iraqi city is an important objective in rolling back the advance of the militant group in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nigeria has reportedly recaptured 36 towns from Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The successes come after the start of a four-nation military offensive with Chad, Cameroon and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The militant group "Islamic State" has threatened to attack famous sites around the world, such as the White House and the Eiffel Tower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The threats were part of an audio message purportedly from the group's spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Islamic State" militants have accepted a pledge of allegiance from Nigerian Islamists Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Although both groups are on the defensive, the new alliance has the potential to worsen the conflict in northern Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Nigeria's militant Islamist group Boko Haram has sworn allegiance to the "Islamic State" (IS).</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The group is the latest in a string of militant organizations to lend their support to the terrorist group.</td></tr>
