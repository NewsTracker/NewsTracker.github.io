<h3>Investigators: Arson suspected in Houston Islamic center fire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ahsan Zahid, assistant imam at the institute, said some items on the grounds were also vandalized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the fire started at the back of the building and moved through the 3,000-square-foot building that was being used to store computers, monitors, lights and everything else they planned to use in the renovations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The fire was so destructive that it completely destroyed our building - everything that was in the building and even the roof is falling in," he said on a video posted to Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Council on American-Islamic Relations called for state and federal investigators to monitor the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Given the unprecedented level of anti-Muslim rhetoric in our society, it would only be prudent to investigate a possible bias motive for this apparent arson attack," Ruth Nasrullah, a spokeswoman for the organization, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Post by Quba Islamic Institute.</td></tr>
