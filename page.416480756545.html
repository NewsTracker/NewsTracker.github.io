<h3>F1 technology moves into the supermarket fridge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One's cutting-edge aerodynamic technology is moving into the supermarket chill cabinet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Williams Advanced Engineering, part of the Formula One team, said on Friday they had partnered with start-up Aerofoil Energy to develop a device that will save money and energy by keeping more cold air inside open-fronted refrigerators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Such multi-deck appliances account for a significant proportion of supermarket operating costs, with cold air spilling out into the aisles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Williams said their aerofoil system, modeled with computation fluid dynamics and tested at their F1 factory in central England, can be attached onto each shelf to redirect the air flow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest supermarket chain with 1,100 stores, is among retailers testing the product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Aerofoils help the airflow around Formula One cars and can improve their performance -- and that's exactly how they help the fridges in our stores, by keeping the cold air in," said Sainsbury's head of refrigeration John Skelton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This Formula One inspired innovation has already shown it can cut carbon produced by major refrigerators."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Williams Advanced Engineering managing director Craig Wilson said the Formula One derived technology had global potential.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The savings in operational costs and emissions are extremely promising," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Williams estimated that supermarkets and convenience stores accounted for some five to 10 percent of Britain's total energy use, with 60-70 percent of that energy consumed by refrigerators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It said tests of the aerofoils had produced energy savings ranging from 18 to 41.5 percent.</td></tr>
