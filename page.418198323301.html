<h3>Google Photo App Labels Black Couple 'Gorillas'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google has said it is "genuinely sorry" after its image recognition software labelled photographs of a black couple as "gorillas".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Google Photos application, launched in May, uses an automatic tagging tool to help organise uploaded images and make searching easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the artificial intelligence software mistakenly described African-American computer programmer Jacky Alcine and his friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Monday, Mr Alcine, of Brooklyn, New York, spotted the egregious blunder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a series of tweets to Google, he said: "Google Photos, y'all f***** up. My friend's not a gorilla."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He added: "The only thing under this tag is my friend and I being tagged as a gorilla."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Alcine also remarked: "What kind of sample image data you collected that would result in this son?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He received a response from Google's chief social architect Yonatan Zunger later that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This is 100 percent not okay," said Mr Zunger, promising a fix later that evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google said in a statement: "We're appalled and genuinely sorry that this happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are taking immediate action to prevent this type of result from appearing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There is still clearly a lot of work to do with automatic image labeling, and we're looking at how we can prevent these types of mistakes from happening in the future."</td></tr>
