<h3>Intruder Dashes Across F1 Track During Practice</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An intruder dashed across the track during the second practice session at the Chinese Grand Prix on Friday before being apprehended by security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dressed in dark clothes, the man scaled a 10-foot fence separating the grandstand from the track, dashed across the starting grid and then leapt over the pit wall and through a gap in the fence toward pit road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He barely made it across the track in between cars that were racing down the main straight at top speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A spokesman for FIA, the sport's governing body, said the man was holding a grandstand ticket in his hand and wanted to "try the cars."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FIA said it was investigating the incident, which did not cause a delay to the practice session.</td></tr>
