<h3>Greece's governors agree to lend cash to central government</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's governors and other local officials agreed on Saturday to lend cash to the near-bankrupt central government after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras assured them the measure would last for only a short period of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek lawmakers approved a decree late on Friday to force state entities to lend cash to the central government in spite of protests by municipalities and labor unions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The measure, which was approved by 156 lawmakers in the 300-seat chamber, caused an outcry by local governors, who met Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Saturday to seek an explanation about the necessity of the action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We got assurances that the measure is an emergency and temporary one, so it will become optional in a short time," the head of the Greek group representing local government officials, Kostas Agorastos, told reporters after the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Since he (Tsipras) talked to us honestly, and since our country needs this negotiating tool now for the negotiations to be completed, we will give it this tool," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Just weeks away from running out of cash, Athens has been tapping the cash reserves of public sector entities through so-called repo transactions to cover its needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Monday it ordered entities including local governments to lend spare cash to the state while it tries to reach a deal with skeptical foreign creditors on new financial aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The state is committed to paying salaries and pensions," the government's parliamentary speaker, Nikos Filis, told lawmakers, defending the legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The money will be earning better interest rates (than what banks pay)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a symbolic protest, municipal workers walked off the job for three hours on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some local government officials have threatened to defy the orders, while others have said they need more information before contributing to central government coffers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The protests added to pressure on Tsipras, whose decision to battle lenders has become increasingly unpopular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A University of Macedonia poll this week showed 45.5 percent of Greeks approved of the government's negotiating stance, down roughly 30 percentage points from February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Athens is locked in a dispute with its EU and IMF creditors over its proposal for a deal to obtain cash in exchange for making reforms, and progress has been limited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Euro zone finance ministers said after the end of a meeting in Riga on Friday that the prospects for a deal were distant and time was running out and accused Greece of failing to move quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Athens must pay the International Monetary Fund almost 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in May. It has said it wants to honor its obligations and needs lenders to offer something in return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"For all this time, Greece and the Greek people have been bleeding to fulfill their debt obligations - a proof of the government's willingness to reach a solution," government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis told Mega TV on Friday.</td></tr>
