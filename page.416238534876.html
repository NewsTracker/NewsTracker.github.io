<h3>Durst pleads not guilty to federal gun charge in New Orleans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Real estate scion Robert Durst, who has been charged with murder in California, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to a federal gun charge stemming from his arrest last month in New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Durst's lawyers have sought his extradition to Los Angeles County, where prosecutors want him in connection with the 2000 killing of a longtime friend, Susan Berman, in a case recently chronicled in the HBO documentary series "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the federal charge and similar Louisiana state weapons charges mean that Durst, 72, is likely to remain in Louisiana for the foreseeable future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Appearing frail, Durst entered his not guilty plea before Judge Lance Africk in the Eastern District of Louisiana, who scheduled a hearing in the case on June 11, with a trial to begin on June 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I'm glad we have some dates," said his attorney, Dick DeGuerin, after the hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He declined further comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Durst, who remains incarcerated pending trial, is due in court on May 7 on the state charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The final episode of the HBO series aired a day after his March 14 arrest at a New Orleans hotel, where authorities said he was staying under an assumed name with $42,000 in cash, a revolver, about five ounces of marijuana and a latex mask.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Authorities have said Durst was likely seeking to flee to Cuba.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His attorneys say FBI agents who arrested him and initially searched his hotel room did so improperly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Durst was also indicted last week on Louisiana charges of possessing a weapon as a felon and carrying a firearm with a controlled substance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The federal charge, of being a felon in possession of a firearm, carries up to 10 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The HBO series documented several police investigations of Durst over the years, including the dismemberment killing of a male neighbor in Texas in 2003 for which he was tried and acquitted of murder, and the 1982 disappearance in New York of his wife, Kathleen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Toward the end of the series, Durst was presented with evidence of his handwriting appearing to match that of Berman's likely killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Durst's voice was subsequently captured on a microphone after the interview concluded as saying he had "killed them all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Durst has long been estranged from his family, known for its significant New York real estate holdings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Prosecutors say he is worth some $100 million.</td></tr>
