<h3>Gray 'victory rally' in Baltimore</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baltimore's mayor has lifted a citywide curfew six days after riots were sparked by the death of a black man who suffered a severe spinal injury while in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Protests since Monday's riots have been peaceful, and the announcement of charges against six officers involved in Freddie Gray's arrest eased tensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said today that her goal was not to maintain the curfew any longer than was necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The six officers face charges ranging from manslaughter to second-degree murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Baltimore's unrest came amid a fierce national debate over police treatment of minorities and follows the deaths of unarmed African-Americans in New York, South Carolina and Ferguson, Missouri.</td></tr>
