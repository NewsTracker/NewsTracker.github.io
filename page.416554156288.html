<h3>Families trying to visit Bali nine delayed by Indonesian authorities</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The families of Bali nine pair Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were delayed by an agonising three and a half hours as they attempted to visit the condemned Bali nine duo on Monday morning, after Indonesian officials required them to fill out new paperwork.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Although the visitors permit system has been the same for two months, a new supervisor changed procedures without advising the Australian embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The families were forced to report to the Cilacap prosecutor's office before being allowed to board the ferry to Nusakambangan Island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A self portrait of Myuran Sukumaran is taken from Kerobokan Prison to Wijaya Pura in Cilacap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The duo's families received the news they were dreading on Monday - they would be forced to say their final farewells on Tuesday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Australians have submitted requests for designated spiritual advisers who will be alone with them in their final hours before their death as well as being present as witnesses during the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sukumaran has asked long-time friend and supporter Christie Buckingham, a senior pastor from Melbourne's Bayside Church, who has been visiting both men for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While Chan nominated Salvation Army minister and family friend David Soper to oversee his final moments, pending Indonesian approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Coffins are loaded on trucks at the Bali;s port city Cilacap in central Java in anticipation of the Bali duo's execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The men's Indonesian lawyer, Leonard Arpan, said prosecutors had informed them they must leave Nusakambangan, known as death island, for the last time about 2pm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The men will be tied to wooden planks in a field and shot about midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If the first round of bullets doesn't kill the pair, they will be shot in the head by a Brimob commander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The pair have expressed their simple final wishes, with Sukumaran wanting to paint as long as possible while Chan wishes to go to church with his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Both prisoners are desperate to be outside in the fresh air away from the isolation cells on the 'Iron prison'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Personal items including a haunting self-portrait by Sukumaran were transferred from the prison to the nearby port city of Cilacap in a further demonstration of the grim reality that the pair will be executed in a matter of days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Military training near Nusakambangan Prison, where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be executed within days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Desperate claims by the former lawyer of the Bali nine pair, Muhammad Rifan, were revealed by Fairfax Media on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He claims he was asked to pay 1 billion rupiah, about $130,000 at the time, to judges to ensure Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran got a sentence of less than 20 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However the Attorney-General's office and the Supreme Court intervened with judges informed to impose the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, said Mr Rifan's allegations were "very serious".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"They call into question the integrity of the sentencing process," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"[It] underlines why we continue to request Indonesia to allow the judicial commission to finalise its review ... An execution is an irrevocable step and I believe that these hearings and these appeal processes should be concluded before any decision is taken."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Meanwhile, lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran echoed Ms Bishop's concerns about the "disturbing" allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"This is unfair," Indonesian human rights lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"People should not be executed if the judgment came from a defective process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We appeal to the Attorney-General. We appeal to the President. In the name of due process of law, fairness and justice, do not do the executions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>'They wanted $130,000 ... and then more':...</td></tr>
