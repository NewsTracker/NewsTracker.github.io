<h3>Baltimore Police: Man Arrested Near Scene of Recent Riots</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Days after riots crippled Baltimore, tensions again escalated after police said they arrested a man who appeared to be armed in a scuffle that drew a crowd of protesters who chanted "black community control the police!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Melvin Russell said police pursued a man who was spotted on surveillance cameras and appeared to be armed with a handgun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police said the man was taken into custody after a brief chase, during which a gunshot was heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russell said that police never fired their weapons and that no one was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Police recovered a handgun loaded with three rounds, one of which was spent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The suspect was not injured and did not want to be transported to a hospital but was taken to the hospital anyway in an ambulance, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Live television coverage and photos tweeted from the scene showed medics putting a man in an ambulance and a large police presence, with officers lining up to apparently block one street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The arrest happened in the same area where police first spotted Freddie Gray on April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was arrested and fatally injured in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Six officers were charged Friday in Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A few dozen police officers wearing helmets and carrying shields formed a line across North Avenue as crowds gathered across the street, occasionally shouting "control the police" at the officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Minutes after police briefed reporters, the line of officers left the street and police began to allow traffic to get through the intersection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Meanwhile, about a dozen protesters briefly blocked traffic while chanting "Kill the killer cop!" and "Black community control the police!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>State Sen. Catherine Pugh, who was nearby and arrived at the scene shortly after the incident, said she was trying to sort through conflicting narratives of what happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She said witnesses insisted that police had shot someone, which police denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said police did a good job defusing tensions after the incident by quickly breaking down a barricade and scaling back the number of officers on the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But she said police should consider using different enforcement tactics while tensions are still high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I think we need to keep police presence down at this time, especially in this area," said Pugh, a Democrat who represents west Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I think we ought to just dial it back a little. Let's give the community a chance to heal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>James Carter, manager of Metro PCS cellphone store, said the incident happened about 5 feet from his shop on North Avenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He heard a single gunshot and waited to hear another, but didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Carter said he looked outside and saw no sign of a gun on the sidewalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He went back into his shop, came back out and then saw a gun on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He said he also saw a young African-American man lying on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Carter said he saw no blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He said the young man yelled as he was put into the ambulance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Carters said people are "extremely" jumpy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>This is the biggest police presence at Pennsylvania and North avenues since Saturday, the last night of the curfew, he said.</td></tr>
