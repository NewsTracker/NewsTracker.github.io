<h3>Netanyahu says he gave 'practical alternative' to Iran deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a speech that stirred political intrigue in two countries, Netanyahu told Congress that negotiations underway between Iran and the U.S. would "all but guarantee" that Tehran will get nuclear weapons, a step that the world must avoid at all costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday his speech to the U.S. Congress offered a "practical alternative" to a possible Iranian nuclear deal, while opinion polls showed his party received a slight bump following his address ahead of the country's March 17 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama said the Israeli leader had offered no viable alternative to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons, saying "there was nothing new" in Netanyahu's speech Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a statement released after he landed in Israel, Netanyahu said the alternative deal he presented in Congress would make it harder for Iran to build a nuclear bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I proposed a practical alternative that through tougher restrictions would extend the breakout time, by years, that it would take Iran to reach a nuclear weapon if it decides to breach the agreement," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said his proposal also would maintain restrictions until Tehran stops "its sponsorship of terrorism around the world, its aggression against its neighbors and its calls for Israel's destruction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said he received "very encouraging" responses from Democrats and Republicans to his speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Netanyahu's contentious speech to Congress took place despite objections from the White House, aggravating his already-strained relations with Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The West fears Iran could build an atomic bomb with its nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iran insists its program is for peaceful purposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Iran and the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany reached an interim accord over the Islamic Republic's disputed nuclear program in November 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Now, negotiators hope to reach a rough draft of a permanent deal by the end of March and a final agreement by June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Wednesday night, a poll broadcast on Israel's Channel 10 showed Netanyahu's Likud party picking up two seats to 23, which puts it neck and neck with the dovish opposition, the Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It surveyed 952 people with a margin of error of 3.5 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Another poll on Channel 2 had Likud increase from 22 to 23 seats with the Zionist Union maintaining a slight lead at 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It surveyed 790 people with a 3.5 margin of error.</td></tr>
