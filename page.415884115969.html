<h3>Lausanne deal would pave way for nuclear-armed Iran: Netanyahu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The deal being hammered out between world powers and Iran on its nuclear programme would "pave the way" to a nuclear-armed Tehran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The greatest threat to our security and our future was and remains Iran's attempt to be armed with nuclear weapons," he said in a speech to parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The agreement being formulated in Lausanne paves the way to that goal," Netanyahu said, referring to talks between Iran and world powers in the Swiss city on a framework deal which he opposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We will do everything to protect our security and our future," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Netanyahu's remarks, made at the swearing-in ceremony of the Israeli parliament, came hours before the deadline for a framework agreement aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, in exchange for easing crippling sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to Netanyahu, the emerging agreement will "most likely leave Iran with underground facilities, the nuclear reactor in Arak, advanced centrifuges -- all those things that were just a few months ago rightly presented to us as not essential to a peaceful nuclear programme."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu said the "breakout time" for Iran to obtain fissile material for a bomb would not be "years" but rather "a year, possibly even much less than that," under the framework agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>According to Netanyahu, "most" Arab states shared Israel's concerns regarding a nuclear-armed Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They understand the Iranian threat, the share our perspective on other threats from extremist Islamist elements," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This also creates opportunities," said the Israeli premier.</td></tr>
