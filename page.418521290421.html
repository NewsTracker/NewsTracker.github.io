<h3>Liberia confirms new Ebola case as outbreak spreads</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Health workers gather at a clinic in Nedowein, Liberia, July 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A Liberian woman has died of Ebola in a hospital in Monrovia shortly after being admitted, becoming the sixth confirmed case of the virus since it resurfaced last month after a seven-week lull, a senior medical official said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The victim from Montserrado County, which contains Monrovia, is thought to be linked to the other five cases from neighboring Margibi County, where the disease reemerged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Her detection raised fears that the infection may be spreading in a new area of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There is one new case. This time, the response area is Montserrado county. The person died in Monrovia," Liberia's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Francis Ketteh told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A health report sent to officials in the anti-Ebola response said that the woman died a few hours after admission, indicating that surveillance of known contacts from the earlier cases had not been rigorous enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>More than 11,200 people have died from Ebola since the epidemic began in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Liberia was declared Ebola-free on May 9 but reported a new case nearly two months later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Health officials say the virus probably remained latent in the country during that period and could have been reactivated by a survivor, via sexual transmission.</td></tr>
