<h3>[video] Wall Street Traders Run for Cover as Brazilians Take the Streets</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Traders pushed up the cost to insure the nation's debt to an almost six-year high on Monday, one day after more than a million Brazilians took to the streets to protest government corruption, higher taxes and President Dilma Rousseff's handling of the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The credit-default swaps have risen faster this year than those for Russia, India and China, the three others that make up the BRIC group of nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With the economy on the brink of its deepest recession in a quarter-century, a growing chorus of lawmakers and citizens has come out in opposition of austerity measures that Levy says are needed to keep Brazil from losing its investment grade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>O Estado de S.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Paulo reported last week he threatened to quit, which rattled traders across all assets and deepened selloffs in Brazil's debt, equities and currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We're in a fragile moment," Joao Junior, a fixed-income trader at ICAP Brasil, said by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The pushback that he's facing "will generate stress in the market."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Finance Ministry's press office referred Bloomberg News to a March 13 report in Valor PRO where Levy said he and his team have no plans to leave the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Since entering office in January, Levy has capped some spending at ministries and raised taxes on items including fuel, credit and cosmetics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said Monday the belt tightening will rebuild investor faith in Brazil while leading to economic growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Credit-default swaps fell 17 basis points his first two weeks in office after rising 89 basis points during Rousseff's first term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The first step toward gaining confidence is getting the public accounts in order," the University of Chicago-trained economist said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rousseff's approval rating in a Datafolha poll fell to 13 percent, her lowest ever, as measures advocated by Levy to shrink the deficit contributed to increased unemployment and higher consumer prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The poll conducted March 16-17 surveyed 2,842 people and has margin of error of two percentage points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Latin America's biggest economy will contract the most since 1990 in 2015 as higher taxes and a weaker currency fan above-target inflation, according to the latest central bank survey of analysts and data from the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Brazilians marched in every one of the nation's 26 states Sunday, with more than a quarter of the protesters in the city of Sao Paulo calling for Rousseff's impeachment, a separate poll by Datafolha showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Vania Dias de Nascimento, 38, says she wanted to join the demonstrations in Brasilia but couldn't afford the bus fare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She lost her cleaning job in February when her employer said cost increases made it too expensive to keep her on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I shouldn't have voted for Dilma," said De Nascimento, a mother of two who is still looking for employment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We thought she was going to govern well, but that's not what she's doing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Many lawmakers in Congress have tried to block Rousseff's austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Senate President Renan Calheiros, a member of the ruling coalition, this month rejected the administration's provisional decree to unwind payroll tax breaks, forcing it to re-submit the proposal as a bill that will take longer to take effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The administration's conflict with Congress and the Estado report sparked speculation last week that Levy would leave office, contributing to a plunge in the real, according to Joao Paulo de Gracia Correa, head of currency trading at Correparti Corretora de Cambio, which trades $3.9 billion annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Brazil's currency on March 13 depreciated against the U.S. dollar to the lowest level since 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The government needs to try to rebuild bridges with Congress to be able to approve the needed measures," De Gracia Correa said by phone from Curitiba, Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"If Levy sees that he won't get it, it's very possible that he will give up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Levy was scheduled to meet with Fitch Ratings on Wednesday, according to his agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He will emphasize Brazil's commitment to meeting this year's primary surplus goal, according to a person close to the government's economic team who isn't authorized to speak publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Brazil for the first time last year posted a primary deficit, which excludes payments on interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Standard & Poor's last March lowered Brazil's credit rating to one level above junk, citing what it said were deteriorating fiscal accounts and a slowing economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"Levy is making some progress, but against very difficult political backdrop," Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income at Jefferies Group LLC, said by phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The main problem right now is governability and a weak government. Price performance when you have that main concern makes Brazil vulnerable to market risk."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>(A previous version of this story corrected poll results to show Rousseff's approval rating is her lowest ever, not the lowest since 1992.)</td></tr>
