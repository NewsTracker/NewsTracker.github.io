<h3>Netanyahu claims victory in Israel election after hard right shift</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Difficult coalition talks still lie ahead, in a politically divided country where no one party has ever won an outright majority in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Isaac Herzog, Netanyahu's chief opponent and head of the center-left Zionist Union, said "everything is still open" and that he already had spoken to party leaders about forming a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But after days in which Zionist Union appeared poised to defeat Netanyahu's Likud, the exit polls late on Tuesday put the two parties in a dead heat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu sought to seize the momentum, taking to Twitter to portray the photo finish as a triumph that defied earlier predictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Political commentators said Netanyahu seemed to have the easier path to forming a cabinet, with the support of traditional rightist allies - which would put him on course to becoming Israel's longest serving leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But he would also need the backing of kingmaking centrists, who were non-committal on their future moves after the polls closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu pulled off the feat with a pitch for ultranationalist votes in the final days of the hard-fought campaign, using tactics that could deepen a feud with the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Netanyahu has focused on Iran's nuclear program and militant Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But many Israelis had said they were tiring of the message, and the center-left campaigned on social and economic issues, surging in polls before election day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>An exit poll for Channel 2 TV gave Likud 28 seats and Zionist Union 27 in the 120-member parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Channel 10, revising its survey several hours after voting ended, put that margin at 27 seats for Likud to 26 for Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Channel 1 had both parties tied at 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Against all odds: a great victory for Likud," a beaming Netanyahu told cheering supporters in a speech at party election headquarters in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said he had spoken to leaders of other right-wing parties and urged them to form a "strong and stable" government with him without delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Opinion polls in the run-up to the ballot had shown Zionist Union with a three- to four-seat advantage over Likud, suggesting the public had warmed to Herzog, who won over voters with flashes of wit after enduring being lampooned for his short stature and reedy voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An initial count gave Likud a 32-24 seat lead over Zionist Union but that was based on votes from 57 percent of the polling stations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Final results were not expected until later on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A new centrist party, Kulanu, led by former communications minister Moshe Kahlon could tip the scales in coalition talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After the balloting ended, Kahlon said he did not rule out a partnership with either Likud or Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The exit polls gave right-wing and religious parties about 54 seats, and left-leaning factions, 43 - both figures still short of a governing majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It may be weeks before the country has a new government, and until then, Netanyahu will remain prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Turnout was around 72 percent, higher than the last election in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>After the final results are in, and following consultations with political parties, it will be up to President Reuven Rivlin to name the candidate he deems best placed to try to form a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The nominee will have up to 42 days to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Rivlin has called for national unity, signaling he favors a government that would pair both Likud and Zionist Union - a partnership Netanyahu rejected during the campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Naftali Bennett, leader of the ultranationalist Jewish Home party, said he had spoken with Netanyahu and agreed to open "accelerated" coalition talks with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But Zionist Union could find a lifeline from Kulanu and from Arab parties that united for the first time in a joint list of parliamentary candidates and came in third in the exit polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>While they are unlikely to join a government, the Arab parties could give a center-left coalition tacit support and create a block against Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>If the center-left is to assemble a government, it will also need the support of ultra-Orthodox parties, which the polls said would win 13-14 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Ramping up his bid for right-wing votes, Netanyahu on election day accused left-wing groups of trying to remove him from power by busing Arab-Israeli voters to polling stations, a statement that drew a sharp rebuke from Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Some political rivals accused Netanyahu of racism over the remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Obama administration has been angry at Netanyahu since he addressed the U.S. Congress two weeks ago at the invitation of Republican lawmakers, to oppose ongoing U.S. nuclear negotiations with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In the last days of campaigning as he sought to persuade supporters of smaller right-wing parties to "come home" to Likud, Netanyahu promised more building of Jewish settlements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Cautioning that yielding territory would open the way for attacks against Israel by Islamic militants, Netanyahu said the Palestinians would not get their own state if he were re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Those sweeping promises, if carried out, would further isolate Israel from the United States and the European Union, which believe a peace deal must accommodate Palestinian demands for a state in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator in peace talks with Israel that collapsed in April, told Reuters it appeared Netanyahu would form the next government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Citing the Israeli leader's rejection of a Palestinian state, Erekat said: "Mr. Netanyahu has done nothing in his political life but to destroy the two-state solution."</td></tr>

<h3>Despite a Remarkable Turnaround, Netanyahu's Fate Remains Uncertain</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The music kept blaring and their supporters tried to find a positive spin, but it was hard to mask the sense of disappointment at the Zionist Union's Election Night party in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The prevailing mood for days had been one of optimism: The party, a center-left coalition led by Labor Party chief Isaac Herzog and former Justice minister Tzipi Livni, had a four-seat advantage in the final pre-election polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The public had soured on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Likud strategists feared a washout, with an internal party poll showing them as low as 17 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But around 9 p.m., an hour before polls closed, rumors started circulating through the crowd: Netanyahu had turned it around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Outside the hall, a campaigner pulled aside a Knesset member: "It's a tie," she said, a grim look on her face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Final results will not be published for a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Exit polls, though, showed a 27-27 tie between Likud and the Zionist Union, or a one-seat advantage for Netanyahu, a remarkable turnaround.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both men will struggle to form a strong coalition; Netanyahu closed the gap, in part, by stealing votes from his allies on the right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Still, it is hard to see the results as anything but a defeat for Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The arena booked for his victory speech never filled up; a few dozen supporters danced awkwardly in the center, surrounded by hundreds of empty seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The optimism was gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His supporters found a few bright spots: For one, the Zionist Union's 27-seat haul was better than most surveys had predicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We achieved something extraordinary today," Herzog said when he finally emerged to speak after midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Since the elections of 1992 we haven't achieved such a result. This enables us to return to power."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hilik Bar, the Labor Party's secretary-general, said the rough balance between the left- and right-wing blocs leaves Herzog with a shot at forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Something is going to change here. The right-wing bloc still shrunk, despite all the weeks of incitement," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>All of the party leaders will meet with President Reuven Rivlin on Wednesday and recommend a candidate for prime minister; he will have the first shot at forming a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Herzog will focus his efforts on two party leaders in the coming days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>One is Moshe Kahlon, a popular ex-Likud minister now heading his own centrist party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>His 10 or 11 seats will decide which camp takes the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>So far, he is elusive: He called Netanyahu and Herzog shortly after the polls closed and declined to endorse either, saying he would defer his decision until final results are published.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The other is Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, a coalition of Arab parties that ran together for the first time, and could use his projected 13 seats to support Herzog from outside the coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This election was largely a referendum on Netanyahu, who has held his job for a total of nine years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He has become almost the sole face of his party, staring down from banners and billboards across the country, and Likud activists feared his unpopularity would lead many fatigued voters to stay home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He closed the gap by swinging hard to the right in the campaign's final days, renouncing his support for Palestinian statehood by declaring it "no longer relevant" in a chaotic Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>On Election Day he turned to a more sordid tactic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>There were early reports of high turnout in Arab communities, where the Joint List said 10 percent of voters had gone to the polls by 10 a.m., triple the number from 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Likud quickly sent a mass text message to its supporters warning, "Arabs are going in droves to the polls."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The overt appeal to racism brought a surge of last-minute supporters to the polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We need a right-wing government, or Buji is going to let the Arabs run wild in the Knesset," said Dvir Amar, 23, a student in the southern city of Sderot, referring to Herzog by his nickname.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>They were hardly enthusiastic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A certain archetype of voter emerged throughout the day in Likud strongholds: grim-faced, rushing away from the polling station, as if he'd just done something distasteful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I didn't vote for any person. I voted Likud, but it wasn't for him," said one man in Ashdod.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"It had to be done," shrugged a voter in Sderot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The results are hardly a strong mandate for Netanyahu, giving him barely one fifth of the 120-member Knesset, not a ringing endorsement for an incumbent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Rivlin has said before that he will push for a unity government between Netanyahu and Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It seems unworkable; the two men have divergent views on the economy, to say nothing of the peace process with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Yet it would offer Herzog a senior cabinet post, a chance to burnish his national credentials ahead of the next election, which will come sooner rather than later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Netanyahu claimed victory in his own speech on Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Beneath the rhetoric, though, both men know such claims are premature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Exit polls showed a far-right party, Yachad, below the electoral threshold, but its percentage is slowly rising as ballots are counted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>If it reaches four seats and enters the Knesset, it would be the final nail in Herzog's coffin, giving Netanyahu a clear path to a right-wing coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Their fates will not be decided for another week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"You can all go home now and get some sleep," Herzog told his supporters, who dutifully complied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"There won't be any decisions made tonight."</td></tr>
