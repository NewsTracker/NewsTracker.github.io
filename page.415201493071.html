<h3>Ukraine crisis prompts EU to shake up stance on neighbors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The EU's executive Commission also began work on a new immigration policy, which will offer expanded opportunities for legal migration as a way of reducing a wave of illegal migrants that has led to thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The European Neighbourhood Policy was introduced in 2003 to enable the EU to develop better relations with all the countries that surround it, including former Soviet republics as well as North African and the Middle Eastern states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, its offer of a cooperation and free trade agreement to Ukraine in 2013 helped spark a political crisis there that toppled pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovich and led indirectly to Russia annexing Crimea and war in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That in turn triggered Western sanctions on Russia and the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some critics accused Brussels of being naive and failing to take account Russian sensitivities over EU expansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said self-criticism would be part of the review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But she denied that the EU's overtures to eastern Europe were confrontational.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It was very clear from the beginning, it is in any case very clear now, that the door of European cooperation is always open, also for Russia," she told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An EU discussion document, drawn up by officials to help kindle the internal debate, said the EU should recognize that some countries were keener than others on close cooperation and the bloc should offer a range of alternatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In some cases, working with one country will require the European Union to cooperate with "the neighbors of the neighbors," it said -- a clear reference to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The EU's existing policy disappoints countries such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova because it makes no promise that they might one day be considered for EU membership and there was no indication that Brussels was ready to change that stance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Southern European countries led by Italy are clamoring for EU action to help them cope with tens of thousands of African and Middle East migrants crossing from war-torn Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At least 10 North African migrants died when their rubber boat overturned in the Mediterranean on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Last month, more than 300 people died in a single week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The EU's new policy will expand possibilities for legal migration and allow people to apply for asylum without risking their lives at sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That could go down badly in some EU countries where hostility to migration runs high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said the EU planned to appoint immigration attaches in some overseas offices to allow people to apply for asylum in their own countries.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali nine: Indonesian president Joko Widodo says executions will not be this week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When asked about the rehabilitation of the two Australians, Mr Joko said he could not discriminate between people from different countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran is surrounded by masked security personnel upon arriving at Cilacap airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I think the decision (to execute Chan and Sukumaran) was already taken by the court," he said during an interview with al-Jazeera on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers have appealed against the president's rejection of the men's clemency pleas, on the basis he did not consider their cases on an individual basis or take into account their reformation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The men instigated a number of vocational courses in Bali's Kerobokan prison, including art, life-saving, philosophy, sewing, computer and bible study classes, which have changed the lives of other inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Riot police gather outside Kerobokan prison for the transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, Mr Joko said he had looked at the cases of the prisoners who are facing imminent execution on Nusakambangan island before rejecting their pleas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I looked at how many drugs they were carrying, how many kilograms they distributed," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Joko has previously indicated he was unaware the Bali nine were arrested trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin to Australia rather than bringing drugs into Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Pressure: Indonesian President Joko Widodo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Asked how he felt about the death penalty as a person, Mr Joko reiterated his concern about the 4.5 million people in Indonesia whose lives are "in ruin" because of drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If you come to drug rehabilitation centres, you will see the effect drugs have on these people," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"You don't just look at the people who sell the drugs, you also have to look at their victims."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bali nine death row inmates Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran transferred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Asked if there could be no alternative punishment given Indonesia's notoriously corrupt legal system, Mr Joko said he was still convinced the justice system in Indonesia was valid when it came to drug crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Indonesian Attorney-General's office refused to confirm to Fairfax Media that the executions would not be held this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Meanwhile, cabinet secretary Andi Widjajanto said the president told cabinet and the Attorney-General to take the concerns of the Australian government over the execution very seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran boards the flight for Nusakambangan in Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We realise it creates a kind of tension between Indonesia," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Andi said there were similar tensions with the Dutch government, which withdrew its ambassador after one of its citizens was executed on January 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We take the concern of our friendly neighbour seriously. So the president asked the Attorney-General to coordinate with the foreign minister in processing the execution plans."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran were on Wednesday transferred to the penal island known as Indonesia's Alcatraz in a massive display of military might.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Australians, who will be executed with eight other drug felons, will be given 72 hours notice of their deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo is expected to hold a press conference on Friday to announce the timing of the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Asked on Wednesday if the executions would take place this week, Mr Prasetyo said "We will see", adding that he was waiting on the latest report on the killing field, the firing squad and the religious counsellors who will accompany the prisoners in their final hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He has repeatedly said the executions would be held as soon as possible once all those facing the firing squad were on Nusakambangan Island because prison authorities were concerned about the unsettling effect of condemned men and women on other prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Australian government, which was not informed of the plan to transfer the prisoners on Wednesday, warned of repercussions if the men are executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I am sure that Indonesia understands it will have consequences," Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Channel Nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>However, she said Australia was unlikely to recall Australian Ambassador-designate Paul Grigson from Indonesia in the wake of the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Brazil and the Netherlands both withdrew their ambassadors to protest their citizens being shot in the first round of executions held on January 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also warned Australians against taking out their anger at the looming executions in Indonesia but confirmed the Australia-Indonesia relationship was going through a "very difficult period".</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mr Abbott said he was "revolted" at the prospect of the executions and said "millions of Australians feel quite angry" and "sick in the guts" about what is happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"But I've got to say anger is not a very good basis on which to determine a nation's policies and in the long run anger is not a very good basis on which to determine your own conduct."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Streets were blocked off in Bali and two buses of crowd control police carrying riot shields and batons were at Kerobokan prison before dawn on Wednesday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A water cannon was also sent to the prison in case of trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In a dramatic demonstration of force, Chan and Sukumaran were flown to Cilacap, the closest town to Nusakambangan, accompanied by two Sukhoi fighter jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The pair were transferred to Wijaya Pura port in a Barracuda - an armoured personnel carrier - as part of a long convey of police and military vehicles, many of which had sirens blaring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>There were chaotic scenes at the port, with armed police officers lining the streets as the Barracuda was driven onto a ferry to make the brief voyage across the narrow strait to the penal colony that has become known as death island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's families are making the agonising final journey to Cilacap, where they will be allowed to visit the Australians until just before the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said family members would be able to visit Chan and Sukumaran until a few hours before the execution when they would be placed in an isolation cell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In Indonesian executions only a religious figure can accompany a prisoner on death row during their final hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"There will be the last moments when contact with others will be limited," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He confirmed the prisoners would each face a firing squad of 12 executioners, three of whom will have live ammunition, so no-one will know who fired the fatal shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>A commando will also be present to shoot the men in the head if they are not dead after 10 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"We want to show the world that Indonesia is truly trying hard to fight drugs," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said authorities were considering the last wishes of the Bali nine pair, including which religious figures would witness their deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>It is understood Chan, himself a qualified minister, would like to be accompanied by a family friend who is a pastor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Meanwhile, Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi - who some credit as the most influential musician in the creation of heavy metal music - has appealed to the metal-loving Indonesian president to spare the lives of the two Australians on death row.</td></tr>
