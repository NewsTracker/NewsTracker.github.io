<h3>Germanwings co-pilot battled depression: Media</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Investigators carried multiple boxes of items from Lubitz's apartment in Duesseldorf and his parents' house in Montabaur, near Frankfurt, but Duesseldorf police spokeswoman Susanna Heusgen said that "no crucial piece of evidence has been found yet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A German aviation official told The Associated Press on Friday that Lubitz's file at the country's Federal Aviation Office contained a "SIC" note, meaning that he needed "specific regular medical examination."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Such a note could refer to either a physical or mental condition, but the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information, said the note does not specify which.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, neighbors described a man whose physical health was superb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He definitely did not smoke. He really took care of himself. He always went jogging. I am not sure whether he did marathons, but he was very healthy," said Johannes Rossmann, who lived a few doors down from Lubitz's home in Montabaur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>CNBC's Annette Weisbach discusses the latest news following the Germanwings plane crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>German news media painted a picture of a man with a history of depression who had received psychological treatment, and who may have been set off by a falling out with his girlfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Duesseldorf prosecutors, who are leading the German side of the probe, refused to comment on the anonymously sourced reports, citing the ongoing investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said there was a "several-month" gap in Lubitz's training six years ago, but would not elaborate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Following the disruption, he said, Lubitz "not only passed all medical tests but also his flight training, all flying tests and checks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had issued Lubitz a third-class medical certificate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In order to obtain such a certificate, a pilot must be cleared of psychological problems including psychosis, bipolar disorder and personality disorder "that is severe enough to have repeatedly manifested itself by overt acts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The certificate also means that he wasn't found to be suffering from another mental health condition that "makes the person unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges" of a pilot's license.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>French investigators, who are in charge of the probe into the plane crash, believe the 27-year-old locked himself inside the cockpit and then intentionally smashed the Germanwings plane into a mountainside on Tuesday during a flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>People in Montabaur who knew Lubitz told AP they were shocked at the allegations that he could have intentionally crashed the plane, saying he had been thrilled with his job at Germanwings and seemed to be "very happy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Germanwings, a low-cost carrier in the Lufthansa Group, said it was setting up a family assistance center in Marseille for relatives of those killed in the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"In these dark hours our full attention belongs to the emotional support of the relatives and friends of the victims of Flight 9525," Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said in a statement.</td></tr>
