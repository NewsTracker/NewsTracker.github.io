<h3>Review: New Apple Photos app makes fixing, cropping easy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The app makes organizing and editing photos easy by bringing many professional-level tools to a free consumer package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This screen shot shows picture adjustment tools, at right, within Apple's new Photos app for Mac computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This screen shot shows the "moments view" within Apple's new Photos app for Mac computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - If you're like most people, those hundreds of photos you took on vacation are still on your camera or phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You shared a handful on Facebook or Instagram, and tell yourself that you'll sift through the others - one day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Procrastinate no more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple's new Photos app for Mac computers, available Wednesday as a free software update, makes it easy to organize and edit your pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The app, which replaces iPhoto, bundles professional-level tools such as granular color correction into one free consumer package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Like other free apps such as Google's Picasa, Photos is good for auto-enhancing, cropping and other basic touches such as lightening underexposed shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But it goes further by also including some of the advanced fine-tuning you'd find in a tool like Adobe Lightroom, which costs $149.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If you already use Photos on your iPhone or iPad, you'll see many similarities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Images are organized automatically, partly using location information embedded in the pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>You can also view photos on a map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Mac's app goes further in using face-detection technology to group photos by the people in them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Click on any photo to begin editing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Enhance button alone will improve many shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Adjust tool enhances lighting, color and other attributes separately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Each attribute has an auto button along with a slider you can adjust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Click an arrow to unveil the advanced controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>I like to adjust something called white balance to compensate for, say, the yellowish glow of indoor lighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cameras do this automatically, but not always correctly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In pictures taken on a recent trip, a friend's baby looked too blue, and a waterfall looked too yellow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Photos fixed those quickly, just by hitting "auto."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Lightroom usually requires more steps to correct similar issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Photos has a lot of cropping options, though my favorite is the auto button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It straightens photos based on the horizon, among other features.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>My only complaint is it takes a few extra steps to make sure the cropped image retains the original's dimensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>I hope a future update will let me set that as the default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With a new iCloud Photo Library online-storage service, all your mobile photos will sync to the Mac app, along with your iPhoto albums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>You can import additional photos, including those in cameras' proprietary RAW formats, which many pros prefer using.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>All images are stored online in high resolution, whether they were taken on an iPhone or imported from another camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Your entire library is then accessible on all your devices, and any edits you make will sync.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>By storing full-resolution images online, Photos can free up space on your Mac or mobile device by substituting a lower-quality version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>You can still get the original whenever you need it, but it's not taking up room if you don't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Photos figures all that out for you and takes into account how much space you have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Any photo you delete disappears from all your devices simultaneously, but don't fear, you have about a month to retrieve it from the cloud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Check the Mac's App Store for version 10.10.3 of the Mac system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Turn on iCloud Photo Library on your Mac and mobile devices when you see the prompts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>You may need to buy more iCloud storage through Apple, as the 5 free gigabytes only translates to roughly 3,000 iPhone photos, not to mention video or larger files from stand-alone cameras.</td></tr>
