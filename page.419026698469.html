<h3>N.M. governor: "Coward" who set off 2 church blasts will be caught</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LAS CRUCES, N.M. -- New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez is promising that the "coward" who set off explosions outside two Las Cruces churches will be caught.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The small blasts just 20 minutes and a few miles apart shocked congregants Sunday morning at the churches in southern New Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There were no injuries or deaths from the blasts outside Calvary Baptist and Holy Cross Roman Catholic in Las Cruces, Las Cruces police spokesman Danny Trujillo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Each building sustained minor damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities are working to determine who planted the explosives and have not said if more than one person is being sought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They are also trying to determine what materials were used and whether the blasts were related.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It doesn't appear to be coincidental because of the timing, but you never know," Trujillo told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Several agencies including the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and New Mexico State Police are assisting with the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"These devices were intended to do harm, I believe, and could have done harm to people," New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said, according to CBS affiliate KRQE.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Martinez told reporters late Sunday that Las Cruces residents should continue to attend houses of worship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She said that if the intention was to bring fear to those who worship, it was a failed effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The first explosive device went off at about 8:20 a.m. in a mailbox on a wall near the administrative entrance to Calvary Baptist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>According to police, several worshippers were inside the church at the time, but services hadn't started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>According to churchgoers, the blast shook the building and there was debris around the damaged mailbox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Las Cruces police Sgt. Robert Gutierrez described seeing "just a lot of paper shreds."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The next blast came from a trash can outside Holy Cross Catholic at about 8:40 a.m. as Monsignor John Anderson was helping pass Communion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I was right in the middle of saying the words 'take and eat, this is my body,' and there was a pow! I mean, I knew it had to be more than a gunshot," Anderson told the Las Cruces Sun-News newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I didn't know if it was a shotgun blast, I didn't know what. But it was very loud, and I just kept on saying the words."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ann Marie Sullivan, a college student attending Mass, said it "sounded like something had fallen off and shattered the glass in the back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The trash can was near a glass entryway, which was damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Police arrived and evacuated the church and blocked off surrounding streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to search the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Services were canceled for the rest of the day at both churches, which are less than 4 miles apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Trujillo said he didn't know of any recent threats involving either church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Other churches in the city have contacted police about what, if anything, they should do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Trujillo said police are advising them to look out for anything suspicious, but don't inspect anything themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Don't go poking around in trash cans or mailboxes," Trujillo said, according to the Sun-News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"If you have any suspicion of anything that's out of the ordinary, please call to police and leave it up to the officers to look it over."</td></tr>
