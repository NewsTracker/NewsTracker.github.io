<h3>Watch live: Benjamin Netanyahu's address to US Congress over Iran nuclear deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seizing the opportunity to speak in the U.S. House to deliver his stern message about the danger Iran poses to his nation's survival and voice reservations about any nuclear deal President Barack Obama and international negotiators might sign with Israel's archenemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu insists he is privy to emerging details of a deal and is expected to lay out specific concerns in Tuesday's speech to a joint meeting of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Obama administration complains that the speech - arranged by congressional Republicans without consulting the White House - is injecting partisanship into the longstanding alliance between Israel and the U.S. Netanyahu said Monday he means no disrespect to Obama but is morally obliged to speak out against any deal that might leave open a chance for Israel's archenemy to develop nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Adding to the controversy, the speech comes just two weeks ahead of a tight national election in which Netanyahu is fighting to hold onto his job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Obama does not plan to meet with Netanyahu while he's in Washington, saying he wants to avoid any perception that he is meddling in Israel's election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Israeli leader fears the U.S. and its negotiating partners will give Iran too many concessions, leaving it on the cusp of developing an atomic bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu is personally vested in the outcome of the nuclear talks with Iran, putting him on a collision course with Obama, who has put his prestige on the line to pursue a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meanwhile, the U.S. and Iranian sides met for two hours on Tuesday morning in the Swiss resort of Montreux, according to U.S. officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They likely will continue meeting through Netanyahu's speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both sides said they were making progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As many as 40 Democratic members of the House and more than a handful of senators are expected to skip the speech, which many have labeled a partisan political stunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Vice President Joe Biden, president of the Senate, also won't be there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He's on a trip to Central America and his seat on the dais will be filled by Sen. Orrin Hatch, president pro tempore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Members of Congress who are expected to be no-shows at the speech blame House Speaker John Boehner for inviting Netanyahu without consulting with the White House or congressional Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice has said the speech is destructive to the fabric of U.S.-Israeli relations.</td></tr>
