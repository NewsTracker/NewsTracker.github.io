<h3>Apple reports record earnings for recent quarter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>With consumers worldwide continuing their love affair with the large-screened iPhone 6, Apple on Tuesday reported record earnings for its third fiscal quarter, with profit soaring to $10.7 billion, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $49.6 billion, compared with $1.40 a share on $37.4 billion in quarterly revenue a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple attributed the strong showing to record-breaking sales of iPhones and Macs, along with strong revenue from services such as the App Store and the successful launch of Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As expected, Apple did not release a breakdown of how many watches it had sold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But in a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said sales had accelerated over the past three months and added, "I'm convinced the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers the keynote address during Apple WWDC on June 8, 2015 in San Francisco, California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Despite breaking new sales records, Apple only barely beat the numbers Wall Street was seeking and its share price was hammered in after-hours trading, dropping 10 percent at one point from the market close of $130.75.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, with iPhone sales at 47.5 million during the quarter, up 35 percent from the same period a year earlier, and profit surging 38 percent, Cook said he was thrilled with the quarterly results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We had an amazing quarter, with iPhone revenue up 59 percent over last year, strong sales of Mac, all-time record revenue from services, driven by the App Store, and a great start for Apple Watch," Cook said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The excitement for Apple Music has been incredible, and we're looking forward to releasing iOS 9, OS X El Capitan and watchOS 2 to customers in the fall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Analysts had expected a profit of $1.81 a share on revenue of $49.43 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The analysts also estimated that Apple sold 1.84 million smartwatches in the quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The hearty sales numbers for the iPhone were nonetheless significant, given the fact that the third quarter has traditionally shown slow smartphone sales as consumers tend to hold off on buying until a new model comes out later in the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One of the most closely watched segments of Apple's business has been its new watch, which first shipped in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While the company has not released any sales figures of its own, the Apple Watch reportedly became the world's leading seller among wearables, according to analysts at Canalys, who estimated 4.2 million smartwatches were shipping in the second calendar quarter of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, another report from Slice Intelligence said watch sales fell precipitously throughout the quarter, estimating that fewer than 20,000 watches a day have been selling, compared with about 200,000 units sold each day of the launch week, a point that Cook seemed to contradict during the call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Veteran Apple watcher Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, said in a note last week that watch sales won't do much until 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We believe the Watch has been disappointing for some investors," he wrote, "but in line with our expectations for a slow start. In speaking to investors, we have been surprised at the level of concern around the long-term opportunity for the Watch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And Munster predicted sales would improve over time as native apps for the device, versus current ones that simply mirror the iPhone, are rolled over later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The watch is at a very early stage right now and the story has yet to evolve," said analyst John Jackson with IDC, who estimates 2.4 million watches were sold in the quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"In the long term, this is perhaps a product intended to make all Apple products sticky. With the watch it's maybe less about the sheer number of units sold as it is about how it cements the benefits of being in the Apple family."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Apple's earnings came just hours after interruptions were reported with many of Apple's own services, including the App Store and iTunes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Apple did not comment other than saying, "We are investigating and will update the status as more information becomes available."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In a "System Status report" from Apple at 10:55 a.m. Pacific time, all services showed a green light.</td></tr>
