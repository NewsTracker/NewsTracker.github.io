<h3>AP PHOTOS: Other-World Sights Await Antarctica Tourists</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Antarctica is the last terrestrial tourism frontier that nature lovers, adventurers and explorers are rushing to visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This tourist season, which runs November through March, more than 37,000 people are expected to visit the coldest continent on Earth, about 10 percent more than last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While some tourists climb Mount Vinson, Antarctica's highest point at 16,050 feet (4,892 meters), others take in the views of other-worldly terrain or snap pictures of huge groups of penguins as they bop in and out of the water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Still others do extreme sports, like scuba diving in icy waters, or imagine themselves as early 20th century explorers during reenactment expeditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>No matter the draw, a strong dose of humor, patience and humility, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars, are an essential part of any Antarctica vacation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Without fail, every year some tourists are left waiting for the sun to come out, or for a patchy Internet connection to work, or even for help to get their stuck boots dislodged from the ice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The harsh environment requires vacationers to come with many essentials: water-resistant hiking boots, several layers of winter clothes including long underwear and a parka, and powerful sun lotion and dark shades with extra ultraviolet protection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Was it worth it? Yes, of course it was," said Christine Brannan of England, who along with dozens of other tourists spent a few days stranded on a cruise ship waiting for thick fog to clear so they could go home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"But I would say to anybody who wants to do the flight and cruise to be aware of the unpredictability."</td></tr>

<h3>Barcelona vs Real Madrid - El Clasico: Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez, Bale, Neymar, Benzema - how do you fit them all into a combined XI?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Back when these two met in October's El Clasico, Barcelona were enduring a relatively poor start to life under Luis Enrique, while Real Madrid were just shy of half-way through what would end up a 22-game winning streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fast forward five months and the tables have turned, Barcelona have lost just three times and drawn one of the 30 matches they have played since then, while Real Madrid have really struggled since the turn of the year, winning only nine (and drawing two) of their 16 matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Boos permeate the Bernabeu on a regular basis and Carlo Ancelotti is suddenly fighting for his job - such is life for the players and managers at Real Madrid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Barcelona once again look like the most dominant team in Europe, sweeping aside Manchester City in midweek, while Real Madrid almost went out to Schalke a week back, losing 4-3 at home in a terrible showing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Lionel Messi and Co hold just a single point more than their bitter rivals - though they have a much superior goal difference - and this game, like every Clasico, will go a very long way to deciding the Spanish Primer Division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As the world's mega-stars prepare to go head-to-head, who makes it into a joint side of the best players?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Read more: Will Real ever love Bale like they loved Beckham?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Barcelona: Bravo, Alves, Mascherano, Pique, Alba, Busquets, Rakitic, Iniesta, Messi, Suarez, Neymar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Real Madrid: Casillas, Carvajal, Ramos, Pepe, Marceloa, Kroos, Modric, Isco, Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo.</td></tr>
