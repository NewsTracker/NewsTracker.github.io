<h3>ACLU: Snowden proved NSA Internet spying harms Americans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The American Civil Liberties Union, Wikimedia and other groups are suing the National Security Agency over its surveillance practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The lawsuit says the agency violates the free speech and privacy rights of Americans by tapping into the U.S. internet backbone to monitor online communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued the National Security Agency and the Justice Department on Tuesday, challenging the government's practice of collecting personal information from vast amounts of data harvested directly from the Internet's infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The suit filed in federal court in Maryland accuses the NSA of scooping up virtually everything sent via the Internet between Americans and people outside the United States, and then scouring it to identify and monitor foreign intelligence targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A similar challenge was turned away by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said the plaintiffs couldn't prove they'd been harmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This lawsuit says that's changed since the government confirmed the surveillance after its scope and details were leaked by former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This "upstream" surveillance of the Internet's "backbone" of digital networks reaches far beyond any individuals the government is targeting to combat terror attacks, and violates constitutional protections of free speech and privacy, the plaintiffs say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>ACLU staff attorney Patrick Toomey said Tuesday that Snowden's leaks changed the whole legal paradigm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We believe the Snowden disclosures will make an immense difference in how this case will play out," Toomey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Prior to Snowden, the public had never heard of upstream surveillance. But based on those disclosures and what the government has acknowledged itself, we know the government isn't just surveilling its targets, its surveilling everyone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The suit's other plaintiffs include The Wikimedia Foundation, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International USA, the Rutherford Institute, PEN American Center, The Nation magazine, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Global Fund for Women and Washington Office on Latin America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Wikipedia was included on an NSA slide Snowden leaked in 2013 that demonstrated the agency's interest in monitoring communications on certain websites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That frightened Wikipedia contributors, particularly in countries where human rights aren't respected, whose anonymity is essential to the free flow of information, founder Jimmy Wales said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Wikimedia Foundation - which hosts 12 websites including Wikipedia that received more than 248 billion page requests between October 2013 and October 2014 - is directly threatened by the fear that the U.S. government can share the surveillance information it gathers with intelligence agencies in other countries, Wales wrote Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Surveillance erodes the original promise of the Internet: an open space for collaboration and experimentation, and a place free from fear," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Toomey said the government's surveillance tactics are particularly dangerous because they discourage organizations from engaging in global human rights work, saying the programs have a "chilling effect on the work of organizations that are essential to democracy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The suit filed Tuesday echoes the Electronic Frontier Foundation's lawsuit in California accusing the NSA of tapping into an AT&T network in San Francisco to harvest the communications of private U.S. citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A federal judge ruled last month that the plaintiffs would not be able to make their case, since forcing disclosure could compromise national security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mark Rumold, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said Snowden's disclosures could certainly bolster ACLU's argument, but the state secret privilege remains a challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The government still uses the threat of damage to national security to get legitimate constitutional claims blocked in court," Rumold said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Snowden's disclosures have absolutely changed the playing field, but the playing field is not level."</td></tr>

<h3>Illinois senator sees stroke recovery giving him 2016 edge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>speaks during an interview in his office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kirk says the disability he suffers from his stroke has made him more known and more popular than ever, and that it will help him win re-election in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A number of Democrats, particularly incumbent congressmen, are testing the waters for a run to challenge him, but all must be taking what he says into account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) - When U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk suffered a debilitating stroke in 2012, he faced a grueling recovery and serious questions about how he could continue his political career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now the Illinois Republican, who won the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to run for president, is one of the Democrats' top targets as they try to recapture control of the chamber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But far from downplaying his disability, which requires him to rely on a cane or wheelchair at times, Kirk believes it gives him a unique advantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kirk says the setback has raised his public profile, noting that more people now stop to greet and encourage him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He believes it will help steel him against attacks by Democrats lining up to paint him as too extreme for a state that, before he took office, had only elected one GOP candidate to the Senate since 1968.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Now I'm definitely a disabled American with a wheelchair," Kirk said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"That makes me not quite the demonizable Republican candidate that you would think."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>With more traditionally Democratic voters turning out in a presidential year, Kirk likely faces an even tougher contest for re-election than he did in winning a first term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Illinois last voted for a Republican during George H.W. Bush's landslide victory in 1988, and enthusiasm is expected to be particularly high if Hillary Rodham Clinton - who grew up in the Chicago suburbs - is the Democratic nominee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's a very different electorate in a presidential year," said U.S. Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cheri Bustos, one of several Democrats exploring a challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kirk wouldn't be the first senator to win re-election following a serious health setback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Johnson of South Dakota easily won re-election in 2008, two years after suffering a life-threatening brain hemorrhage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He returned to work the following year, his speech sometimes slurred and using a motorized scooter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Kirk's speech is slower than it was before his stroke, and it can take him longer to respond to questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>If he has trouble articulating answers in a debate or other setting, voters could get the impression he's not up for the job, said Brian Gaines, a political science professor at the University of Illinois.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It sounds crass to make it an election issue," Gaines said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"But it is an election issue."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Kirk's potential rivals have not indicated they plan to focus on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In addition to Bustos, U.S. Reps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Tammy Duckworth, Bill Foster and Robin Kelly all have signaled they may seek the Democratic nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I look at running against his votes," said Kelly, saying she'd focus on a record she doesn't believe has done enough to help working families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In response, Kirk says he believes he and newly elected GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner have a proven "formula" for Republicans to win - even in a place long controlled by Democrats - by taking stances that are socially moderate and fiscally conservative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Under pressure from labor unions and Illinois' large immigrant community, Kirk recently called on Republicans to support a Homeland Security funding bill free of language to block Obama's executive action on immigration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He's one of the few GOP senators to publicly support gay marriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He's been among the strongest voices in the Senate pushing for tougher sanctions against Iran, aimed at curtailing that nation's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That, he acknowledges, is politically advantageous because of the Chicago area's large pro-Israel community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Kirk formerly represented the suburbs north of Chicago in the U.S. House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>On Wednesday he stood by a letter he and other Republicans sent to Iran criticizing Obama's stance on nuclear negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Democrats, including Duckworth and Kelly, called the move inappropriate, but Kirk insisted sanctions shouldn't be weakened until Iran stops its nuclear weapons program.</td></tr>
