    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Camp Chapman was the site where seven CIA employees and a Jordanian intelligence officer were killed in a Pakistani Taliban suicide bombing in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six more agency personnel were wounded in what was considered the most lethal attack for the CIA since the war in Afghanistan began in 2001 and possibly even since the 1983 embassy bombing in Beirut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear whether the CIA still operates out of Camp Chapman.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
