<h3>8 Ukraine soldiers killed despite upcoming cease-fire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Combat persisted in the first hours after the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France signed a peace deal Thursday in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel had cautiously described the agreement as "a glimmer of hope."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The most intense battles were for control of the railway hub of Debaltseve, which the press service for government military operations in the east said was targeted 25 times Thursday by rebel Grad launchers and artillery fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The deadline for the warring sides to halt hostilities is set to take effect on Sunday, at one minute after midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Vladislav Seleznyov, spokesman for the Ukrainian army general staff, said Friday that eight soldiers were killed and 34 wounded over the previous day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Regional authorities loyal to Kiev reported four civilian deaths in areas under their control, while rebels said seven people were killed in artillery attacks on the separatist-held cities of Luhansk and Horlivka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Separatist forces recently have nearly completely encircled a Ukrainian garrison in Debaltseve, where all but a few thousand civilians have fled to areas away from the front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Only one highway had remained linking the town to government-held territory, but Ukrainian access to that supply route looks to have compromised with the apparent capture of the village of Lohvynove, which lies along the road, just north of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Associated Press reporters on Friday morning saw the smoldering remains of two Ukrainian army trucks near the village of Luhanske, some 10 kilometers up the road from Lohvynove.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Donbass Battalion, a unit with Ukraine's National Guard engaged in battles around Lohvynove, said in a statement that captured combatants had confirmed Russian troops were actively involved in battles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Moscow vehemently denies that it provides manpower and weapons to the rebel forces, although the sheer quantity of powerful weapons at the separatists' disposal has increasingly strained that position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Elsewhere, by the Azov Sea in the southeast, Ukrainian government troops say they clawed back a handful of villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Troops there have denied reporters access to the areas at the center of those operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The cease-fire is to be monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's observer mission in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier said in Kiev that he hoped hostilities would be halted by the deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We would really hope to see a decrease already between now and that moment," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Zannier said that combatants would have to do more to enable the OSCE peace-monitoring mission, which makes ample use of drone cameras, to properly fulfil its mandate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Aerial vehicles have been targeted more than once, monitors have been taken hostage, so we need a change of attitude," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The next step, to begin on Monday, is to form a sizeable buffer zone between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Each side is to pull heavy weaponry back from the front line, creating a zone roughly 30-85 miles (50-140 kilometers) wide, depending on the caliber of the weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The withdrawals are to be completed in two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The peace deal envisions an amnesty for people involved in the conflict, but the vague terms of that provision will likely be subjected to further disagreements and negotiation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Speaking to parliament, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said amnesty would not be granted to anybody suspected of committing crimes against humanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"This is an absolute position that was unambiguously underlined during (Thursday's) negotiations," Klimkin said.</td></tr>

<h3>Nigeria's Boko Haram launches first attack in Chad</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Suspected Nigerian Boko Haram fighters attacked a village in Chad early Friday, marking the first such violence against the country contributing the most military might to what is increasingly becoming a regional fight with the armed group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dozens of Boko Haram fighters arrived in the early hours of the morning on motorized canoes at the fishing village on the shores of Lake Chad, setting houses ablaze and attacking a police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"They came on board three pirogues (small boats) and succeeded in killing about 10 people before being pushed back by the army," said a resident of the village of Ngouboua, about 12 miles east of the Nigerian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Other local sources told Reuters said that the death toll was lower, at between three and five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The local chief, Mai Kolle, was killed in an exchange of gunfire with the army, the sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The group, which has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in its bid to establish a state in northern Nigeria, has expanded its attacks against neighboring countries over the past week following threats to punish any nations contributing to the fight against the terror group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Benin have pledged to send military support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chadian soldiers are already fighting Boko Haram fighters inside Cameroon and Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The multinational force to fight Boko Haram is expected to be formally launched in the coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Chadian President Idriss Deby's government mediated peace talks between the Nigerian government and the group last October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The talks sought to secure the release of 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Chibok region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Despite an international outcry against the kidnappings, Boko Haram briefly seized the town of Chibok where the majority of the kidnapped girls were from in November 2014, underlining what many analysts have called the Nigerian military's weakness and inability to successfully combat the armed group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Chad is also the base for a French regional counter-insurgency operation, "Barkhane," which provides intelligence and logistical support to the Chadian army in its fight against regional armed groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A source in Barkhane reached by telephone in N'Djamena told Reuters he was not immediately aware of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Nigeria has postponed for six weeks a presidential election that had been due on Saturday, citing the security threat from Boko Haram.</td></tr>
