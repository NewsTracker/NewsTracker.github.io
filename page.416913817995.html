<h3>Germany says Greek referendum on reform could help</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EU paymaster Germany has said it could make sense for Greece to hold a referendum on painful economic reforms under negotiation with its creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eurozone governments have previously opposed such a vote, saying there is no time and it could destabilise financial markets and trigger a run on struggling Greek banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When former Prime Minister George Papandreou surprised EU partners by proposing a referendum in 2011 at the height of the euro zone debt crisis, he was summoned to emergency talks with leaders of France and Germany and told bluntly to drop the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But with Greece running out of money and desperate for a deal to avert a possible default and exit from the euro zone, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said securing public backing for the necessary sacrifices might be useful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A referendum could make it easier for leftist Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to climb down on election promises that are making a deal on economic reforms hard to achieve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If the Greek government thinks it must hold a referendum, then let it hold a referendum," Mr Schaeuble said on arrival at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"That might even be a helpful measure for the Greek people to decide whether it is ready to accept what is necessary, or whether it wants something different."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hinting at growing difficulties in persuading conservative German lawmakers to go on funding Greece, Mr Schaeuble said it was unrealistic to think any parliament in Europe would agree without the backing of the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece's leftist-led government has accused the IMF of setting harder targets than the European creditors on pension and labour reforms and a primary fiscal surplus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who was due to hold private talks with Mr Schaeuble before the Eurogroup session, told reporters that Athens would make a crucial 750 million payment to the IMF tomorrow as due.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Greece will always meet its obligations to its creditors and we are obviously going to do that tomorrow again," Mr Varoufakis told Euronews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Schaeuble said there had been little or no progress in talks between Greece and the IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Greece is demanding that the ministers acknowledge "significant progress" in the negotiations, hoping to unlock short-term borrowing to ease its acute financing crunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said he did not believe ministers would make such a joint statement, although Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem would hold his usual news conference after the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sources familiar with European Central Bank thinking said there was still too little progress on key issues and too much uncertainty for the bank to allow the Greek government to sell more short-term Treasury bills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Schaeuble said any release of additional funds depended on representatives of the three creditors certifying actual implementation of the reforms, not just promises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A senior EU official said there has been no breakthrough on the central sticking points of pension and labour market reforms and budget targets for this year and next.</td></tr>
