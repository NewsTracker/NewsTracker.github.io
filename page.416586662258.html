<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox scheduled for Tuesday night in Baltimore has been postponed, team officials said following recent violence that has gripped the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a statement, the Orioles said the decision to postpone the scheduled 7:05 p.m. ET game was made after "consultation with Major League Baseball and state and local officials."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Riots in Baltimore forced the cancellation of Monday night's game and just hours later Mayor Stephanie Rawlings Blake announced a week-long curfew in the city beginning Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The violence in Baltimore on Monday followed the funeral of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who was killed while in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nineteen buildings and 144 vehicles were set on fire, and 202 people were arrested, the mayor's office said.</td></tr>
