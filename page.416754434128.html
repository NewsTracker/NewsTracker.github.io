<h3>Tamir Rice's mom Samaria can't live near where her son was killed by police</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The mother of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy killed by Cleveland police last year while he was carrying a toy gun, has revealed that the stalled investigation into the killing has left her homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The news came Monday as Rice's mother, Samaria Rice, along with other relatives, held a press conference after officers who confronted him asked a judge to delay the family's federal civil rights lawsuit until the investigation is complete and potentially works its way through the courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to a court filing by the family objecting to the delay, Ms. Rice revealed she moved to a homeless shelter because she couldn't live so close to where her son was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The family's attorneys objected to the delay Monday, arguing that proceeding with the lawsuit wouldn't cause prejudice for the officers but would increase legal costs and the emotional harm for Tamir's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His body still hasn't been laid to rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'Less than a second, my son is gone - and I want to know how long I got to wait for justice,' his mother said at a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty has said the shooting evidence will be presented to a grand jury when the Cuyahoga County sheriff completes an investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One of her attorneys, Benjamin Crump, questioned why the investigation is still pending despite the confrontation being captured on surveillance video that showed the officer firing within two seconds of a police car stopping near Tamir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'The video captures the whole episode and yet after five months and counting no one has been charged and no one has been held accountable and it breaks his mother's heart,' Crump said at the news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The shooting of Tamir, who was black, by a white officer has raised questions about how police treat blacks and has spurred protests around the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rice's family has filed a federal suit against the city of Cleveland and the two officers involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Timothy Loehmann, the officer who shot Rice, and Frank Garmback, who was driving the police squad car, are white.A police union official has said the officer had no way of knowing Tamir wasn't carrying a real firearm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Cuyahoga County's sheriff's office, which took over the investigation, declined to comment Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Crump noted that the investigation has lasted longer than the work of a task force created by Gov. John Kasich in December to examine community-police relations in Ohio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The county prosecutor has said the case will be presented to a grand jury for possible charges.</td></tr>
