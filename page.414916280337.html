<h3>#Coin for Abbott: Indonesians' angry backlash at PM's Bali Nine diplomacy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bali: Prime Minister Tony Abbott is facing an Indonesian social media backlash over his linking of $1 billion in tsunami aid to the mercy campaign for Bali Nine death-row inmates Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, with a campaign urging people to collect coins to return to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On the streets of Indonesian cities people were asking motorists and passersby for spare change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Meanwhile, social media users were posting pictures of the money they had gathered and hurling insults at Mr Abbott and Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Many also expressed their support for death by firing squad for Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The delay in executions has been linked to everything from phone taps to the unpopularity of PM Tony Abbott, pictured here with Joko Widodo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The twitter campaign, using the hashtags #KoinuntukAustralia, #coinforAustralia and #coinforAbbott and growing rapidly in popularity, highlights how Mr Abbott's remarks have backfired badly in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Abbott said: "Let's not forget that a few years ago when Indonesia was struck by the Indian Ocean tsunami, Australia sent a billion dollars worth of assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I would say to the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government: we in Australia are always there to help you and we hope that you might reciprocate in this way at this time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop was forced to call Indonesia's vice president Jusuf Kalla the next day to clarify the comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Her diplomacy seemed to soothe the concerns of Indonesia's leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Its president Joko Widodo said he was satisfied by the explanation on Friday, while also revealing that his government had been preparing a formal rebuke to Mr Abbott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But many ordinary Indonesians remain enraged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The campaign originated in Aceh, the Indonesian province that was hit hardest by the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 that killed more than 100,000 people there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Among those behind the campaign are victims of the tsunami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's not making any sense. How can aid be mentioned again?," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"If they weren't sincere, the community will give it back" he told Tempo, an Indonesian media outlet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Twitter, Mr Riza said the Australian prime minister was "seungke", referring to an Acehnese saying that those who take back a gift will suffer a skin condition on their elbow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile, supporters of Chan and Sukumaran brought more than 100 bunches of flowers to Kerobokan prison to thank the governor and guards - as well as the Australians - for their efforts to introduce rehabilitation programs in the penitentiary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The flowers were organised by the Mothers for Mercy organisation, a Bali-based group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While there is sympathy for the duo in Bali, especially among expatriates, it does not extend much beyond the confines of the holiday island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Unlike the rest of Indonesia, many Balinese are aware of the extraordinary reforms at Kerobokan instigated by the Chan, Sukumaran and the prison staff.</td></tr>
