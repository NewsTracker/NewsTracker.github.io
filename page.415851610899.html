<h3>Secular blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Machete-wielding assailants hacked to death a secular blogger in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka on Monday, the second attack in five weeks on a critic of religion in the South Asian nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Authorities said Washiqur Rahman was killed on a busy street in the center of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two suspects, believed to be students at a nearby religious school, were apprehended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A third alleged attacker escaped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Police on duty near the spot caught two attackers red-handed with three machetes as they were fleeing the scene after the incident," police official Humayan Kabir told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dhaka Metropolitan Police official Biplob Kumar Sarker said the suspects told police investigators that they targeted Rahman for his anti-Islamic writings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The killing comes just weeks after secular U.S. blogger Avijit Roy was hacked to death while returning with his wife from a book fair in Dhaka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His wife, Rafida Bonya Ahmed, suffered head injuries and lost a finger in the Feb. 26 attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The incidents come during a period of political turmoil in the country, with the government and main opposition group locked in a months-long standoff that has created a sense of deepening insecurity across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In recent years, a string of secular-minded writers have been targeted in Bangladesh as the government has tried to crackdown on hardline groups seeking to create a state based on their interpretation of Sharia law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider was killed in 2013 near his home in Dhaka after he led a protest demanding capital punishment for the leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The party leader had been convicted of war crimes during Bangladesh's war for independence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 2004, Humayun Azad, a secular writer and professor at Dhaka University, was also attacked by armed men while returning home from a Dhaka book fair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He later died in Germany while undergoing treatment for his injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Roy's wife, Ahmed, blamed her husband's murder in February on religious fanatics, and accused police on duty of not doing enough to stop the attack.</td></tr>
