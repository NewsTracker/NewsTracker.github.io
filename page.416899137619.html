<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexico's public health system has suspended infant vaccines and mounted an investigation after two babies died and 29 were sickened in an impoverished community in southern Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Six of the 29 babies are in grave condition after receiving vaccinations for tuberculosis, rotovirus and Hepatitis B, which are generally administered between 0 and 6 months, according to a national schedule.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>The hospital "doesn't have adequate personnel or equipment," Perez said.</td></tr>
