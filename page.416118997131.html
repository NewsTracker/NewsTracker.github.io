<tr><td>13</td><td>This will be delivered straight to their home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A leaked memo from Apple's retail chief Angela Ahrendts to Business Insider told staff to encourage shoppers to buy the Watch online rather than in store, to force a "significant change in mindset" of customers who are accustomed to lining up for hours for the latest product.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>And consumer studies are not pointing to the hype that Apple would have us believe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>One survey by ACCENT Marketing of 1,000 people that were planning on buying a wearable this year, found that four out of five were going to buy the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
