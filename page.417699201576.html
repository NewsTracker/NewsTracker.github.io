<h3>House passes defense spending bill</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - The House on Thursday approved a $579 billion defense spending bill that offers a slight pay raise to U.S. troops, but reflects deep divisions on budget priorities and whether President Barack Obama needs new war powers to fight Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The vote was 278 to 149 in favor of the bill, which drew stiff opposition from Democrats because it uses a war-fighting account to raise defense spending next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The measure gives President Barack Obama roughly all the money he requested for defense, but does so by hiking the war-fighting account - which is not subject to congressional spending caps - by almost $40 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The president says he will veto spending bills that do not deal with the arbitrary spending limits and treat defense and non-defense expenditures equally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This is a strong defense bill that provides our troops with the resources they need and the raise they have earned," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It reflects the reality of a dangerous world, including resources to combat cyberattacks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He noted that only 43 Democrats voted for the bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is part of Democrats' scheme to oppose anything and everything - even a pay raise for our troops - in order to extract more money for the IRS and the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Democrats are playing a dangerous and selfish game with our national security."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats strongly support national defense, but want the spending caps lifted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They oppose using the emergency war-fighting account because it gives the military money for only one year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The defense appropriation bill is bad budgeting and harmful to military planning - perpetuating uncertainty and instability in the defense budget, and damaging the military's ability to plan and prepare for the future," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Before the final vote, the House rejected an amendment to force lawmakers to vote by the end of March on new war powers to fight Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The vote was 231-196 against the amendment, a vote that underscored the lack of political will in both the House and Senate on the bitterly disputed issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Introduced by Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, the measure would have required Congress to debate and vote on a new authorization for the use of military force by March 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The amendment called for banning the use of funds in the fight against IS in Iraq and Syria unless Congress passed a new authorization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Ten months into an undeclared war against ISIS, Congress yet again dodged its responsibility to authorize the use of force," Schiff said after the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"While our pilots and special forces risk it all, Congress refuses to do its job. Congressional abdication of our responsibility to declare war, or to deny authorization for war, sets a terrible precedent and shifts war-making powers substantially and inexorably towards the executive" branch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Wednesday, Obama ordered the deployment of up to 450 more American troops to Iraq in an effort to reverse major battlefield losses to the Islamic State, an escalation but not a significant shift in the struggling U.S. strategy to defeat the extremist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, and Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, are pushing for a new authorization for the use of military force in the fight against IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The defense bill itself enjoyed bipartisan backing when separated from the broader budget debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The measure provides $8.4 billion for 65 next generation F-35 fighter aircraft, eight more than requested by the Pentagon, as well as $16.9 billion toward nine new Navy ships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It also prevents the retirement of the A-10 aircraft that protects ground troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Men and women in uniform would get a 2.3 percent pay hike, a percentage point higher than requested by Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The defense measure also boosts funding for procurement of National Guard equipment well above the Pentagon's request, drawing a protest from the administration, and would also block the transfer of Apache helicopters from the Army National Guard to the regular Army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The companion Senate version of the bill easily advanced through the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday morning but faces a filibuster next week as Democrats seek to force Republicans to the negotiating table to boost domestic accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Senate bill contains even more money for F-35 fighters and shipbuilding and $330 million more than requested by the Pentagon for Israeli missile defense systems.</td></tr>
