<h3>Zayn Malik working on solo material days after quitting One Direction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>According to a report in The Sun, who are carrying his exclusive first interview since his departure today, Malik is working with producer Naughty Boy, who masterminded Sam Smith's award-winning debut release, In The Lonely Hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It is crazy and wild and a bit mad," Malik told The Sun, six hours after news of his leaving the world's biggest boyband broke across the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"But at the same time I've never felt more in control in my life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"And I feel like I'm doing what's right - right by myself and right by the boys, so I feel good."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Signs that Malik's time with the band had slowly chuntered to a halt started to show last week, when he flew home from the Asian leg of the One Direction world tour having been signed off with stress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Malik released an official statement about his departure on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It read: "My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mental health charities have since called on One Direction fans to be cautious of hashtags that appear to promote self-harm and other worrying trends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Meanwhile, concerned bosses have been calling for legal advice as hundreds of workers have requested compassionate leave in the wake of Malik's exit.</td></tr>
