<tr><td>8</td><td>Most of the dead were from neighboring Jalisco state, home of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An official from Michoacan state, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press, said all the dead were men and most died from gunfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the lopsided death toll, and photographs from the scene in which bodies appeared to have been moved, raised questions about the official version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Family members who arrived at the morgue in the state capital, Morelia, to retrieve the bodies echoed these doubts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They all spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals, but some were willing to provide the names of their dead family members.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>Juan Enrique Romero Caudillo, 34, was one of those men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Family members said he sold scrap metal to make a living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He said he had been offered maintenance work at the ranch," said a relative, adding that Romero didn't belong to a gang.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>After seeing his corpse, the relative said Romero had been shot in the head from above and there was bruising on his face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On the death certificate, the cause of death was listed as "destruction of the brain mass due to penetration by a projectile from a firearm."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It did not say if the gunshot was from close range or far away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Romero's relative said he believed what happened on the ranch "was a massacre" not a shootout with criminal gunmen, as the government has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Relatives of Mario Alberto Valencia Vazquez, 22, said he worked in a furniture business but had been offered employment on the ranch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>One relative said Valencia's teeth had been knocked inward as if "he had been struck by something" and his body showed signs of having received blows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Another woman said her husband's face had been destroyed and was missing an eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Government officials weren't immediately available to respond to the comments by the family members, but previously they have said the shooting broke out when federal authorities responded to a complaint of armed men taking over the of Rancho del Sol, in the municipality of Ecuandureo near the border with Jalisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Federal forces heading to the ranch met a truck carrying armed men who opened fire, and when government forces chased the gunmen onto the ranch, they came under heavy fire from others, according to National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Authorities detained three people and confiscated 36 semi-automatic weapons, two smaller arms, a grenade launcher that had been fired and a .50-caliber rifle.</td></tr>
