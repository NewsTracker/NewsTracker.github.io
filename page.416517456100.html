<h3>Rain postpones NASCAR race at Richmond until Sunday (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>RICHMOND, Va.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Weather disrupted NASCAR's top series for a second consecutive week when Saturday night's Sprint Cup Series race was postponed because of persistent rain at Richmond International Raceway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's the first time this season the series has been unable to race because of rain, but completing last Sunday's race at Bristol Motor Speedway was a challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rain caused nearly a 90-minute delay Sunday at Bristol Motor Speedway, and the race was stopped for a four-hour rain delay not long after it finally began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In all, the Bristol event took nearly nine hours to complete from start to finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Joey Logano will start from the pole when the Richmond race begins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Denny Hamlin, who grew up 20 minutes from the speedway in Chesterfield, will start second in his attempt to complete a nearly perfect weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hamlin won the pole for Friday night's Xfinity Series race and then led all but two laps in winning the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The victory, the 100th in the Xfinity Series for manufacturer Toyota, came as Hamlin returned to competition after getting out of his car at Bristol with neck spasms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said the spasms began around Lap 12, and after receiving treatment during the long rain delay, the decision was made for him not to resume the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Joe Gibbs Racing development driver Erik Jones replaced Hamlin in the car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Following Friday night's victory, Hamlin said he made the right call not to race anymore at Bristol and look ahead to the Richmond races.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''We knew we had a big week ahead of us coming up here at Richmond and I needed to be 100 percent for that,'' Hamlin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I think we made the right decision and obviously it's all paying off so far.</td></tr>
