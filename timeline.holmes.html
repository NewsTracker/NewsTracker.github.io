<li>Doctor who found Holmes insane didn't watch much of video</li>
<li>Dr. Jonathan Woodcock, one of the first defense witnesses to take the stand, interviewed Holmes four days after the July 20, 2012, shooting to determine if he was competent to stand trial and then again earlier this year when he was asked by the defense to testify on Holmes' sanity.</li>
<li>He said Holmes was so delusional and psychotic as a result of deep-seeded mental illness that he was unable to tell right from wrong when he opened fire on the theater - Colorado's standard for an insanity verdict.</li>
<li>Brauchler pointed out that Woodcock didn't talk to Holmes about the crime or his plans for the shooting in either interview and already completed a report concluding he was insane before the second, one-hour interview.</li>
<li>But, pressed further by defense attorney Daniel King, Woodcock said he reviewed Reid's report based on the interview and many other records and evidence and did not find anything that would have changed his own conclusion about Holmes.</li>

<li>A psychiatrist who determined that Colorado theater shooter James Holmes was insane at the time of the 2012 shootings says that people suffering from delusions can't always control behavior - even if they know the behavior is wrong.</li>
<li>Dr. Jonathan Woodcock interviewed Holmes four days after the attack and concluded that he wasn't sane.</li>
<li>Woodcock testified Thursday that Holmes had a strong family history of mental illness and was in the grip of a psychotic compulsion he could not control.</li>
<li>Jonathan Woodcock said Holmes' emotions also were extremely flat.</li>
<li>That kind of reaction in the wake of the mass shooting helped Woodcock conclude that Holmes was suffering from significant mental illness.</li>
<li>Jonathan Woodcock is an assistant professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Colorado's medical campus, the school where James Holmes was studying before the July 2012 attack.</li>
<li>Prosecutors in the Colorado theater shooting are questioning whether one of the defense's most important witnesses - a psychiatrist who interviewed James Holmes - should be considered an expert.</li>
