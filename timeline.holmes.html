<li>Colorado shooting defendant James Holmes called ‘psychotic’ by his attorney</li>
<li>Daniel King said Holmes had been mentally ill even before the 2012 attack on the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and urged the jurors to look beyond how the gunman planned his attack.</li>
<li>The prosecution had earlier argued that the deliberate nature of the planning and execution of the attack showed that Holmes was not mentally ill.</li>
<li>"There isn't a lot of logic in what Mr. Holmes did," King said.</li>
<li>In his presentation, Brauchler emphasized how Holmes deliberately planned the attack to compensate for failures in his graduate school studies and in his romantic life.</li>
