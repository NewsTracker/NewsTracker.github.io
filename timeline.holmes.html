<li>Now the trial enters a new phase as the jury decides whether Holmes should die for his crimes.</li>
<li>Starting next week, jurors will hear testimony about Holmes' mental illness and his childhood.</li>
<li>Prosecutors may counter with even more heartbreaking accounts from victims, ranging from those Holmes maimed to the father of his youngest victim, a 6-year-old girl who died in the 2012 attack.</li>
<li>There was a muted, heartbroken sense of relief Thursday afternoon following Holmes' conviction on 165 counts of murder, attempted murder and other charges.</li>

<li>A psychiatrist who determined that Colorado theater shooter James Holmes was insane at the time of the 2012 shootings says that people suffering from delusions can't always control behavior - even if they know the behavior is wrong.</li>
<li>Dr. Jonathan Woodcock interviewed Holmes four days after the attack and concluded that he wasn't sane.</li>
<li>Woodcock testified Thursday that Holmes had a strong family history of mental illness and was in the grip of a psychotic compulsion he could not control.</li>
<li>Jonathan Woodcock said Holmes' emotions also were extremely flat.</li>
<li>That kind of reaction in the wake of the mass shooting helped Woodcock conclude that Holmes was suffering from significant mental illness.</li>
<li>Jonathan Woodcock is an assistant professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Colorado's medical campus, the school where James Holmes was studying before the July 2012 attack.</li>
<li>Prosecutors in the Colorado theater shooting are questioning whether one of the defense's most important witnesses - a psychiatrist who interviewed James Holmes - should be considered an expert.</li>
