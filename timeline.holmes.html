<li>George Brauchler, lead prosecutor in the case against convicted Colorado theater shooter James Holmes, responds to questions during an interview Friday, Aug. 14, 2015, in Centennial, Colo.</li>
<li>Brauchler said that the jury's refusal to sentence Holmes to die for one of the worst massacres in the country's history does not mean the public is growing wary of capital punishment because only a single juror blocked the execution.</li>
<li>The lone holdout felt just as strongly that Holmes should get a life sentence as the 11 other jurors believed he should die for the 2012 shooting, District Attorney George Brauchler said, based on prosecution interviews with some of the panel.</li>
<li>When it was clear she wouldn't budge, the jurors took a vote, and the holdout told them that if mental illness hadn't been a part of Holmes' defense, she too would have favored a death sentence, Brauchler said.</li>
