<h3>Clinton offers energy plans, declines comment on Keystone XL oil pipeline</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton is detailing new energy proposals in Iowa to address climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She calls global warming one of the "most urgent threats of our time" and says people are "just not paying attention" if they don't acknowledge it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But she's still not taking a position on the Keystone XL oil pipeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Democratic presidential contender is proposing that every home in the United States be powered by renewable sources by 2027.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Her plan calls for installation of 500 million solar panels over four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton laid out clean-energy ideas during a tour of a regional bus station in Des Moines, Iowa, on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>When asked about the Keystone XL oil pipeline opposed by environmental activists, she would not comment except to say she wants a State Department review of the project to run its course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Addressing this issue Sunday, Clinton touted a program that would combat climate change at least in part by changing the tax code to promote renewable energy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This is not complicated folks," the former secretary of state told more than 200 people at Iowa State University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I'm just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain. And I know we're facing huge problem."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Climate change has become a key issue in the Democratic presidential primary, where Clinton is the heavy favorite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Billionaire Tom Steyer has led an effort to promote the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Clinton proposes, through tax incentives, to increase the amount of power derived from renewable sources to support every home in the United States within 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For instance, Clinton said she supports renewing the wind energy tax credit as part of over time shifting the U.S. energy system from one based on fossil fuels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We need to get the incentives fixed in our tax system which as you know are too heavily weighted toward fossil fuels," Clinton said during a day of campaigning in central Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Clinton also hinted that her plans would impose changes on the coal industry, though she also pledged the government's help for workers to make the transition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We can make a transition over time from a fossil fuel economy, predominantly, to a clean renewable energy economy, predominantly," Clinton said later during an event at a central Iowa rural home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Weaning the country off of coal is a tricky political position in key places on the political battleground map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Southeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania are regions of states that have been pivotal in recent elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And they remain the home of key coal-producing areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Crediting coal-miners for having "created an industrial revolution," Clinton said "it is important that we help them transition to a new economy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Clinton's plan also includes the goal of installing 500 million solar panels within four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It would also increase capacity to the nation's power grid with a combination of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric and geothermal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The plan's estimated cost is about $60 billion over 10 years, and would be paid for by eliminating tax breaks for the oil and gas industry, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, also seeking the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, noted Sunday that he unveiled a climate change plan in Iowa that addresses not just consumer energy use, but industrial and transportation, as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As governor, O'Malley doubled Maryland's renewable fuel production, and reduced greenhouse gases in the state by 10 percent during his two terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Beamout reported from Ames, Iowa.</td></tr>
