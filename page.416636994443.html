<h3>Garissa attack: Kenyan minister admits tipoff on al-Shabaab assault was ignored</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kenya's interior minister has admitted that intelligence was ignored and the security response botched regarding the Islamist massacre of nearly 150 people at Garissa university in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"There was lack of coordination on the side of the officers,," Joseph Nkaissery told a parliamentary committee on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There was intelligence that this place was going to be attacked."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The interior minister said security should have been "beefed up" but was not, and that once the attack began a "lack of coordination" undermined the response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Militants from Somalia's al-Qaida-linked al-Shabaab rebels killed 148 people during the assault on Garissa University College in north-east Kenya on 2 April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was the group's deadliest attack to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The intelligence and security failings are reminiscent of the 2013 attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall, when prior intelligence was also ignored and there was a similarly botched response, during which a lack of coordination led to the Kenyan army and police firing on each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Appearing before a parliamentary security committee, Nkaissery - who was appointed interior minister in December after his predecessor was sacked following a series of deadly al-Shabaab attacks - defended his ministry and instead blamed regional and county security officials for the failings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Earlier in April two civil servants and seven police officers were suspended pending investigation into suspected negligence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nkaissery also said that because the busy university hostels were "congested" and had grilles on the windows it was difficult for students to escape and for soldiers and a specially trained police unit to get inside the buildings, meaning more lives were lost.</td></tr>
