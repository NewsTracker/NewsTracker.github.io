<h3>Rams sign quarterback Nick Foles to contract extension (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>St. Louis Rams quarterback Nick Foles throws during training camp at the NFL football team's practice facility Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, in St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- The St. Louis Rams quickly decided Nick Foles was their quarterback of the future, signing him to a two-year contract extension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Coach Jeff Fisher broke the news during post-practice remarks Friday at Lindenwood University, grinning at the end of a lengthy answer summing up a scrimmage Friday night that drew about 4,000 fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''Oh yeah, it's a good deal,'' Fisher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It's a good deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's a good deal for us, good deal for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He wants to be here and we want him here right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The deal begins next season and calls for $24 million in salary over two years with about $14 million guaranteed, according to reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He had been scheduled to make $1.5 million this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The 26-year-old Foles seemed a lot more matter-of-fact when he stepped in front of the Rams backdrop minutes later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said getting traded for Sam Bradford in the offseason was a lot more surprising than getting the extension, and added that had he entered the season without a new deal it wouldn't have affected him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Either way, I would have been me,'' Foles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''I play for my teammates, I play for the people that support us, and my family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Of course, now the Rams want to see a lot more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They're trying to end a decade-long string of losing seasons heading into Fisher's fourth year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Rams were 6-10 last year and ended 2014 having played 25 consecutive games without Bradford, twice sidelined with season-ending left knee injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Austin Davis, who's competing with Case Keenum for the backup job, shared starting duties with Shawn Hill last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Together, those two had 20 touchdown passes and 16 interceptions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Foles was acquired from the Eagles after Bradford declined to take a big pay cut in the final year of a five-year deal worth nearly $80 million signed as the first overall pick of the 2010 draft, and Bradford will make $12.9 million this season for Philadelphia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And, at the very least, Foles has some job security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''Yeah, I think If I was him I'd have a lot of peace of mind right now,'' the coach said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Foles, a former third-round pick out of Arizona, has always known that's part of the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''When you are a quarterback, you are one of the guys that everyone is going to look to automatically,'' Foles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''But there's many leaders on this team that do a great job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''That's how you build a culture of a winning franchise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The parties have been talking since the start of training camp and got the deal done without seeing Foles, who missed the last half of last season with a broken collarbone, in a game situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Rams envision the player who had 27 touchdown passes and just two interceptions in a breakout 2013, the third-lowest interception percentage in NFL history, then was the 2014 Pro Bowl MVP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Last year, Foles made eight starts and threw for 13 TDs with 10 interceptions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''It's what he's done on the field early in his career thus far in the league and what he's done for us since he's got here,'' Fisher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''He gets the game, he understands it and he's got tremendous leadership qualities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Foles said earlier in camp that he left contract talks in care of his agent, David Dunn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''I want to be all-in, I don't want to have to worry about contract issues or anything,'' Foles said.</td></tr>
