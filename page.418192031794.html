<h3>Russia halts gas supply to Ukraine amid pricing dispute</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A pressure gauge sits on pipework at Dashava underground gas storage facility in Striy, Lviv region, Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Russian gas company Gazprom halted supplies to neighboring Ukraine on Wednesday after the collapse of price talks, company officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said that Russia halted the supply at around 7:00 GMT because Ukraine didn't make an advance payment for July's delivery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Gazprom is not going to send gas to Ukraine at any price without the advance payment," Miller said in comments carried by Russian news agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russian and Ukrainian energy ministers on Tuesday failed to reach an agreement on future supplies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Russia offered Ukraine a price of $247 per cubic meter, a $40 discount from the current rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ukraine wanted a $100 discount.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak insisted that the discount that Ukraine is asking for is "unjustified" and would put the cost of supplying Ukraine below the market rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ukrainian officials didn't immediately comment on Wednesday about Gazprom's decision to halt supplies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Ukrainian Energy Minister Volodymyr Demchyshyn said Tuesday that the discount Russia had offered wasn't enough and that Ukraine would buy gas from other nations starting July 1 until an agreement is reached with Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Gas consumption is low at this time of year, allowing Ukraine to bargain for better terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ukraine says it has found cheaper supplies from other European nations that resell the gas they receive from Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Moscow has described these so-called reverse supplies as illegal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ukraine imported a third of its total gas supplies from Russia in the first six months of the year, the national pipeline operator said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Pricing disputes between Russia and Ukraine in the past have led to gas wars, leaving other European nations without heating in the dead of winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The last deal that Russia and Ukraine signed in October offered Kiev a discount, but required it to pay in advance for gas shipments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ukraine, which is struggling to balance its budget amid protracted fighting against Russia-backed separatists in the east, relies heavily on gas supplies for its metals and machinery industries.</td></tr>
