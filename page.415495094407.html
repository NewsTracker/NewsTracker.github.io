<h3>Mexican radio station fires journalist who exposed presidential scandal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mexican radio station fires journalist who exposed presidential scandal Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One of Mexico's most prominent journalists, whose team revealed a conflict-of-interest scandal ensnaring President Enrique Pena Nieto last year, has been fired, her employer MVS Radio said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Late last year, reporter Carmen Aristegui exposed that Pena Nieto's wife, Angelica Rivera, was in the process of acquiring a luxury house from a government contractor that won millions of dollars in state business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It later emerged that both Pena Nieto and his finance minister had also purchased houses from government contractors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The revelations damaged Pena Nieto's reputation, compounding a deep political crisis triggered by his government's handling of a probe into the disappearance and apparent massacre of 43 trainee teachers in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last week, MVS Radio and Aristegui publicly locked horns over a brand-new platform for investigative journalism called Mexicoleaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company contended that Aristegui and her team offered MVS's name and funding for Mexicoleaks without authorization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>MVS subsequently fired two of her star investigative reporters due to "loss of confidence", prompting Aristegui to insist that reinstatement of her reporters was an "absolute condition".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Instead of firing them, we should be giving them prizes," Aristegui said on her morning radio show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The events have inspired a torrent of Tweets supporting Aristegui under the hashtag #EndefensadeAristegui (in defense of Aristegui).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In its statement on Sunday, MVS Radio said "as a company, we can't accept conditions and ultimatums from our collaborators."</td></tr>
