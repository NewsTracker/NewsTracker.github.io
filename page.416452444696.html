<h3>Facebook revenue growth slows, costs weigh on profit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - Facebook Inc posted its slowest growth in quarterly revenue in two years and higher spending on research and development ate into profits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shares of the world's largest Internet social network fell 2 percent in after-market trading on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook has warned of heavy investments in 2015 as it steps up efforts to expand a collection of products that include messaging service WhatsApp, photo-sharing service Instagram and virtual reality headset maker Oculus Rift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As a result, Facebook's operating expenses rose 83 percent in the first quarter as R&D costs jumped 133 percent and marketing and sales spending nearly doubled.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's a generally solid quarter. The trends are all going in the right direction. The cost rise is one thing that can derail this story," said Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The question is, can they keep costs under control and what will be the new revenue streams around video, Instagram and virtual reality around Oculus?" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The company offered assurances that it has a handle on spending, saying it now expects expenses to increase by about 55 percent to 65 percent this year, a slight decrease at the top end from its previous forecast of 55 percent to 70 percent.</td></tr>
