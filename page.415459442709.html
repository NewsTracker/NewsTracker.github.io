<h3>A Gender Discrimination Trial Rocks Silicon Valley</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NPR's Arun Rath talks with Wired's Davey Alba about the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gender discrimination in Silicon Valley is at the heart of a court battle that has captivated the tech world this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ellen Pao claims that the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers had a toxic, misogynistic environment that led to her being passed over for promotions and eventually pushed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She is seeking $16 million in damages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kleiner Perkins says Pao simply wasn't qualified for a higher position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Davey Alba of WIRED has been in the courtroom every day of the trial so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I asked her about what the prosecution's been trying to demonstrate through Pao's testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>DAVEY ALBA: They paint a picture of this old-boys culture at Kleiner Perkins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She's testified about a male partner organizing all-male ski trips and dinners at Al Gore's apartment and talks about how he, at one point, said that women kill the buzz, and that's why he's left them out of these events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There's also been some pretty raunchy talk that's been brought up during the trial - talk of the Playboy Mansion, Victoria's Secret fashion shows, how one Kleiner-backed executive had wanted to get Marissa Mayer of Yahoo!</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>on their board, not because she was necessarily qualified, but because she was "hot," quote, unquote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>RATH: So how does the defense for Kleiner Perkins counter that?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I mean, 'cause those things sound pretty bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>How are they countering that there is actually - it's not a hostile work environment?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>ALBA: They've portrayed Pao as this resentful, greedy, aggressive worker at Kleiner Perkins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And they say that, you know, in fact, the composition of their workforce at Kleiner Perkins is 20 percent female, which is above the industry average of 6 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And so they paint Pao as a person who wasn't successful at Kleiner Perkins because she wasn't qualified - that she just wasn't cutting it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>RATH: Given the context in Silicon Valley - the enormous gender disparity that in the tech world we all know about - people are writing about this trial as being kind of a watershed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Could the outcome of this trial lead to real change in the tech industry?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>ALBA: I think it definitely can.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And I think that's why it's being watched so closely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>There is a problem of sexism and gender discrimination for sure - just if you look at the numbers in the tech industry, and in venture capitalism, even more so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>I believe there's four percent female executives in sort of the upper ranks of VC firms according to some studies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>And however the outcome of this trial ends up could lead to changes in the way that the industry views and deals with gender issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But it's a little bit tough because it's kind of hard to take just one single trial as sort of emblematic of gender bias in tech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It's kind of a hard trap to fall into to say that the sexism at your company - your tech company - doesn't look like this, so you don't have a problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That's not necessarily true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>There are many more subtleties involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>RATH: And Davey, where does the trial go from here?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>ALBA: So right now, we have heard from Pao, which has been kind of the pivotal moment in the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>And she's ended her testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Judge Kahn, the judge on this case, hopes to start deliberations by March 23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>So if all goes well, we'll have maybe a week or two more, and then we'll have to listen to closing arguments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>RATH: That's Davey Alba.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>You can read her coverage of the Ellen Pao trial at wired.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Davey, thanks very much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>ALBA: Sure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Thank you.</td></tr>

<h3>Aid workers say 8 people confirmed dead in Vanuatu cyclone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At least eight people were confirmed dead in Vanuatu after a massive cyclone tore through the tiny South Pacific archipelago, and the death toll is likely to rise much higher once communications are restored with outlying islands, aid workers said Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Packing winds of 168 miles per hour, Cyclone Pam tore through Vanuatu early Saturday, leaving a trail of destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer in Port Vila, said officials from Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office confirmed to her agency that at least eight people died in and around the capital, Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A view of part of Vanuatu's capital Port Vila on March 17 after Cyclone Pam ripped through the island nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This handout photo taken March 16 and released March 17 by New Zealand Red Cross/IFRC shows flattened structures and debris caused by Cyclone Pam in the Vanuatu capital of Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In this handout image provided by the New Zealand Defense Force, scenes of devastation are seen in the area around Port Vila on March 16 in Port Vila, Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Officials have yet to assess the damage in many of the hard-hit outer islands because communications and power remain cut, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Morrison said she had heard reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"People are really upset and it's really hard, just because for the last couple of years, we haven't received a really big cyclone like this one," said Isso Nihmei, Vanuatu coordinator for the environmental and crisis response group 350.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Most people right now, they are really homeless."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He came upon one of the storm's victims on Saturday, while surveying the damage along the coastline with other relief workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The group spotted a man lying on the ground, not breathing, and rushed him to the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>By the time they arrived, however, he was dead, Nihmei said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Structural damage across Port Vila was extensive, Nihmei said, with the majority of homes severely damaged or destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some residents began cleaning up what was left of their wrecked houses and checking on family members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Relief workers, meanwhile, were trying to get temporary shelters to victims as fast as possible, Nihmei said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We're still not having communications with the other provinces," Nihmei said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We're just running around trying to get information around Port Vila; with the other islands it's really hard to get anything."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A westward change of course put populated areas directly in the path of Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were unconfirmed reports of an additional 44 deaths in Vanuatu's northeastern islands after Pam moved off its expected track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Residents awoke to much calmer weather Sunday after many hunkered down in emergency shelters for a second straight night, Morrison said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Many people who have ventured out from 23 emergency shelters around Port Vila have found their homes damaged or blown away altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Teetering trees and downed power lines have made parts of the capital hazardous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Morrison said communications have been so problematic that her aid group hasn't yet been able to account for many of its own 76 staff members on the islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>For anybody who wasn't in a secure shelter during the cyclone "it would have been a very, very tough time for them," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 spread over 65 islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>About 47,000 people live in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>UNICEF estimated that 54,000 children were among those affected by the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact and scope of the disaster caused by the cyclone wasn't yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We hope the loss of life will be minimal," Ban said Saturday at the World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The U.N. said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who was attending the conference, told participants, "I do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Morrison said the first priority was to ensure people had adequate food, drinking water and shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Beyond that, she said, there would need to be a long and concerted rebuilding effort in the months ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>New Zealand pledged 1 million New Zealand dollars ($734,000) to help with relief efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>On Sunday, Australia pledged 5 million Australian dollars ($3.8 million) in aid, and sent in a relief team with supplies including water and temporary shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The small island nation, located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, has repeatedly warned it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing resettlement to higher ground and smaller yields on traditional crops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Scientists say it's impossible to attribute single weather events like Cyclone Pam to climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The cyclone has already caused damage to other Pacific islands, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Authorities in New Zealand are preparing for Cyclone Pam, which is forecast to pass north of the country on Sunday and Monday.</td></tr>
