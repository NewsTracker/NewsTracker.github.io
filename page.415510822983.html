<h3>AP Sources: Tim Tebow works out for Eagles (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tim Tebow worked out Monday for the Philadelphia Eagles, two people familiar with the session told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Both people spoke on condition of anonymity because the workout was not made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One of the sources said Tebow worked out at quarterback and left the facility without discussing a contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Considering all the offseason moves made by coach Chip Kelly, taking a look at the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner with the huge following shouldn't be a surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tebow could run zone-read plays better than Philadelphia's four current quarterbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tebow has not been on an NFL team since the 2012 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was released by the Jets, then attended training camp in the summer of 2013 with the Patriots, who cut him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One of the most successful college quarterbacks at Florida, Tebow started 14 games for Denver over two years after being selected in the first round of the 2010 draft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He threw for 316 yards in a playoff win with the Broncos, who traded him for fourth-round pick when they signed Peyton Manning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tebow has been working in television as an analyst for the SEC Network and ESPN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kelly recently traded starting quarterback Nick Foles to St. Louis for Sam Bradford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His backup is Mark Sanchez, who was the starter for the Jets when Tebow was there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That was a highly uncomfortable situation for Sanchez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Matt Barkley and G.J. Kinne are also on the roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kelly's remake of the Eagles' roster has included trading star running back LeSean McCoy to Buffalo, then signing Offensive Player of the Year DeMarco Murray to replace him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Clearly, Kelly - who took over personnel duties after last season - is unafraid to look anywhere for possible upgrades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although Tebow had some success in Denver, his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the NFL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His strength has been running the ball or improvising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There's also been some thought that Tebow might switch to tight end or fullback, although he has balked at such a move in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Eagles have depth at tight end, but no fullbacks on the roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Kelly likes versatile players, though Tebow tried out at QB.</td></tr>
