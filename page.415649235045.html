<h3>Ferguson grateful for his second chance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Blake Ferguson's year out of the NRL made him realise he had to change his ways but he admits his relationship with alcohol is something he'll fight for the rest of his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Sydney Roosters centre is yet to find the tryline for his new club but he said he's in a better place than 12 months ago when he faced an uncertain future after being placed on a two-year good behaviour bond for indecent assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After his court appearance in February last year, Ferguson suffered a broken ankle during a solo training session as he attempted to get fit to find a club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Roosters took on the troubled star late last year with a job in the club's development program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was as part of a series of guidelines set down by the NRL that had to be met before a playing contract could be ratified - something that finally happened in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ferguson admits the experience has been difficult and is doing his best to stay on the straight and narrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It was pretty tough, I lost something that I really enjoyed," Ferguson said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I've played footy since I was four years old and it was the only thing I've known. I went through all the steps the NRL gave me, all the processes I was given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I know I did the wrong thing. I owe the game a lot, it's given me a real good opportunity to get back ... play some footy and earn a good living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I can't take it for granted, once you lose something that is so important you then realise what you have. It won't happen again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ferguson's troubles with alcohol and a difficult upbringing have been well documented and the 25-year-old knows it's something he'll continue to battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"No-one is fully rehabilitated ever," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"There's people out there who are going to Alcoholics Anonymous and never fully rehabilitated until the day they die.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's been two months since Ferguson last had a drink and although the Roosters have not ordered him to stay dry, he's determined to live his life in a more responsible manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I don't drink all the time," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"But I am 25-year-old man ... I now know when to say no ... I've had a few wake-up calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I've not had a drink for eight weeks but I am not going to say I am not allowed to drink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The club have not put any bans on me. I haven't put a ban on myself.</td></tr>
