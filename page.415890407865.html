<h3>Germanwings plane crash: passenger video 'found'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A French Gendarmerie rescue helicopter flies over the debris of the Airbus A320 at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>London: A video of the last moments on the doomed Germanwings plane has been found on a mobile phone memory card at the crash site in the French Alps, according to reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The "totally blurred and chaotic" footage was reportedly made from the back of the Airbus A320 and features the sound of three metallic bangs - presumed to be the captain trying to break into the locked cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Reports of the recording came as Germanwings parent airline Lufthansa said it knew six years ago that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who intentionally crashed the plane last week, had suffered from a "serious depressive episode".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>All 150 people on board the flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, including two Australians, were killed in the disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Germany's Bild newspaper and French magazine Paris Match both reported they had viewed the video of the last seconds of Flight 4U9525.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They said no individuals could be made out and it was unclear whether it had been filmed by a crew member or a passenger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Screams of "My God" can be heard in several languages before the cabin is jolted to the side, apparently when the plane clipped a mountainside, according to the reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>More desperate cries can be heard before the video ends, Bild said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Paris Match said that the footage was recovered from the debris of the wreckage by a "source close to the investigation".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Lufthansa said it was aware of reports about the footage but questioned whether a mobile phone could have withstood the impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We have also read of reports in a French newspaper about the video," a spokesman for the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"But we have not seen the video and we do not know if it exists. Therefore we cannot confirm if the video is genuine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Considering that everything on the plane was destroyed, it would be unusual for a mobile phone to survive the impact."</td></tr>
