<h3>Blatter defies calls to quit as FIFA scandal widens</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The corruption charges engulfing soccer's governing body have heaped shame and humiliation on the game, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said on Thursday, although he flatly rejected calls to resign over the scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With FIFA facing the worst crisis in its 111-year history, Michel Platini, who heads Europe's soccer confederation UEFA, said he had told Blatter to go "with tears in my eyes", but the 79-year-old had refused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I said, 'I'm asking you to leave, FIFA's image is terrible.' He said that he couldn't leave all of a sudden," Platini, a former French international, told reporters.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Ignoring calls to step down, Blatter said: "I know many people hold me ultimately responsible ... (but) I cannot monitor everyone all the time. If people want to do wrong, they will also try to hide it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Platini said 45 or 46 of UEFA's 53 member associations would vote for Prince Ali.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>"The board of FFA has reviewed the manifesto for change proposed by Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein and believes it provides the basis for a fresh start for FIFA."</td></tr>

<tr><td>35</td><td>Both the Australian government and Football Federation Australia needed to speak out about Blatter and the need for reform at FIFA to restore some integrity in the sport, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"I think once you get some countries such as Australia speaking out, the dam will break and many others will speak out on this."</td></tr>

<tr><td>40</td><td>The arrests of the senior FIFA officials in a dawn raid at a five-star Zurich hotel mark an unprecedented blow against football's powerful governing body, which for years has been dogged by allegations of corruption but always escaped major criminal cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>US prosecutors said they aimed to make more arrests but would not be drawn on whether FIFA President Sepp Blatter, for long the most powerful man in the sport, was a target of the probe.</td></tr>

<tr><td>47</td><td>The Federal Office of Justice in Switzerland said that six would contest extradition, but that one person agreed to be extradited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"As charged in the indictment, the defendants fostered a culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for the biggest sport in the world," said FBI Director James Comey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"Undisclosed and illegal payments, kickbacks, and bribes became a way of doing business at FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Blatter, who has denied and survived allegations of his involvement in corruption, said in a statement: "Let me be clear: such misconduct has no place in football and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game."</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The statement also said that FIFA welcomed the actions and the investigations "and believe that it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football."</td></tr>
