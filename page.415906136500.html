<h3>Rebels in eastern Ukraine pay pensions in Russian rubles</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yekaterina Matyushchenko, the finance minister in the Donetsk region's separatist government, said pension payments to retirees in the rebel-controlled areas will total 1.9 billion rubles (over $30 million) in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Another rebel official, Oksana Taran, denied that Russia had provided the money, claiming that the funds came from taxes paid by local businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ukraine's move in November to halt pensions and other social payments to the rebel-controlled territories in the east has hurt the region hard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Local residents have to travel to government-controlled areas to receive payments, which is difficult given an effective government blockade of the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The pensioners' reaction to the payments was mixed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One retiree, Viktor Medvedev, said while the payment had less value than his original pension in Ukrainian hryvnias, he was happy to have it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's certainly not much, but what we can do? I'm glad to have at least this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Another pensioner, Elena Ivanovna, was disappointed with Wednesday's payment, saying it was smaller than she expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They told us we'll receive more," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Can you survive with this money?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A separatist insurgency flared up in eastern Ukraine last April following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More than 6,000 people have died in fighting, according to the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Russia and the rebels expected Ukraine to resume pensions and other payments to the east following February's cease-fire deal, but the Ukrainian authorities haven't yet done so amid fierce arguments over the agreement's interpretation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The truce has largely held despite sporadic clashes, and the parties have pulled back their heavy weapons from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But other provisions of the deal have stalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Yuras Karmanau in Kiev, Ukraine contributed to this report.</td></tr>
