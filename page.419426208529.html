<h3>Fin24.com | Google launches Wi-Fi router for home use</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington - Google launched a Wi-Fi router on Tuesday, the latest move in the company's efforts to get ready for the connected home and draw more users to its services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The cylinder-shaped router, named OnHub, can be pre-ordered for $199.99 at online retailers including the Google Store, Amazon.com and Walmart.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The router comes with in-built antennas that will scan the airwaves to spot the fastest connection, Google said in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With the router, users will be able to prioritise a device so that they can get the fastest internet speeds for data-heavy activities such as downloading content or streaming a movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The router can be hooked up with Google's On app, available on Android and iOS, to run network checks and keep track of bandwidth use among other things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google said OnHub automatically updates with new features and the latest security upgrades, just like the company's Android OS and Chrome browser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The router is being manufactured by network company TP-LINK, Google said, hinting that Asus could be the second manufacturing partner for the product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The product launch comes days after Google restructured itself by creating Alphabet, a holding company to pool its many subsidiaries and separate the core web advertising business from newer ventures like driverless cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Making products for the smart home is one such venture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google in 2014 bought Nest, a smart thermostat maker, for $3.2bn, aiming to lead the way on how household devices link to each other and to electricity grids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The global market for "Internet of Things", the concept of connecting household devices to the internet, will nearly triple to $1.7 trillion by 2020, research firm International Data Corporation said in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Technology firms including Intel, Cisco Systems, Samsung Electronics and telecom giants Vodafone and Verizon are betting heavily on internet device-connected homes for future revenue and profit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Google has also been working on providing faster internet with its Google Fibre service in some US cities.</td></tr>
