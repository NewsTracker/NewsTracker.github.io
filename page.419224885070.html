<tr><td>5</td><td>Though they have previously said a missile strike is the most likely explanation for the crash, they have never revealed that they are in possession of possible missile parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, they cautioned that the conclusion cannot yet be drawn "that there is a causal connection between the discovered parts and the crash of flight MH17."</td></tr>
