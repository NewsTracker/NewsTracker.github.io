<h3>So Social: Use Facebook's See First feature correctly so you don't finish last</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Now that Facebook has launched updated controls for News Feed that let the user, not Facebook, decide what users "See First," it's more important than ever to make sure that what you post and what you share are "first-worthy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's quite simple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If I decide to put your content at the top of my News Feed, I expect great stuff - all the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What you give the user will determine whether you get that coveted star and the ability to show up first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Because remember: As easy as it is to apply the star and See First status, it's just as easy to remove it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Your job is to make sure your followers don't ever want to remove it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This will be easier for some pages and profiles than others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>_Links to stories tend to do pretty well: By that I mean stories you can click on via an actual link versus a post that contains a pasted shortened URL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This might be a link from some other page or your own content on a blog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But remember to make sure that no matter how you post it that the content is something shareable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The simplest test is to ask yourself if you'd share it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>You'd be surprised how taking a step back and thinking about it from that perspective matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>_Go to video: If you are the type of person or business that has the ability to upload native video that's shareable, then you are in excellent shape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Video is where it's at right now on Facebook, but not just any video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Keep it short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And whatever you do, make sure you hook the viewer quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Use Facebook insights to find out who is clicking, and perhaps more importantly, how long they are watching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This will help you decide how to tailor your overall video strategy and make changes where needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>_Quality over quantity: Just because your posts show up first doesn't mean you should overwhelm that person's feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The quality over quantity rule has been around since social media became a thing, and I can't think of anything that will ever change that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>_Show your human side: When people write on your wall or leave a comment, make sure they know you are there by responding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some will be positive; others may be negative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But one of the fastest ways to lose your See First status, in my opinion, would be to act as if you don't care about what people have to say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>That could actually lead to someone unliking your page completely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Rest assured, people will abuse this feature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some person somewhere is already hard at work figuring out how to post a mixture of compelling content followed by something spammy as a way to get around paying for advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Those people are banking on your being enamored of some great post, setting their content to See First and forgetting about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Hopefully Facebook will crack down on this, but if the past is any indication, users will be doing more of the policing than Facebook itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>And in a way that's fair, because if Facebook is finally giving you some granular control over your News Feed, it's up to you to keep it looking the way you want it.</td></tr>
