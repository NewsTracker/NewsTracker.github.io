<h3>Saddam Hussein?s tomb leveled after battles with ISIS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OUJA, Iraq - The tomb of Iraq's late dictator Saddam Hussein was virtually leveled in heavy clashes between militants from the Islamic State group and Iraqi security forces in a fight for control of the city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fighting intensified to the north and south of Saddam's hometown Sunday as Iraqi security forces vowed to reach the center of Tikrit within 48 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Associated Press video from the village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, shows all that remains of Saddam's once-lavish tomb are the support columns that held up the roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Poster-size pictures of the late Sunni dictator, which once covered the mausoleum, are now nowhere to be seen amid the mountains of concrete rubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead, Shiite militia flags and photos of militia leaders mark the predominantly Sunni village, including that of Maj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the powerful Iranian general advising Iraqi Shiite militias on the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is one of the areas where IS militants massed up the most because Saddam's grace is here," said Capt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Yasser Nu'ma, an official with the Shiite militias, formerly known as the Popular Mobilization Forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The IS militants set an ambush for us by planting bombs around the palace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iraqi soldiers inspect the tombs of Uday and Qusay Hussein, sons of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, in Tikrit on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Iraqi soldier stands next to the demolished tomb of Saddam Hussein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An Iraqi soldier takes photos of the demolished tomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The extremist Islamic State group has controlled Tikrit since June, when it waged its lightning offensive that saw Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, come under their control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The group claimed in August that the tomb had been destroyed, but local officials said it was just ransacked and burned, but suffered only minor damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Saddam's body has been kept in the mausoleum in his birthplace, Ouja, since 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The complex featured a marble octagon at the center of which a bed of fresh flowers covered the place where his body was buried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The extravagant chandelier at its center was reminiscent of the extravagant life Saddam led, until US forces toppled him in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Iraqi media reported last year that the body was removed by loyalists amid fears that it would be disturbed in the fighting.</td></tr>
