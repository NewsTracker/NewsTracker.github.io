<h3>Apple and banks dismiss Apple Pay fraud worries</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But recent reports have noted that some criminals are using it for stolen credit cards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One industry consultant, Cherian Abraham, estimates that Apple Pay fraud rate can reach a whopping 6% of transactions at some banks -- 60 times the average credit card fraud rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He stressed to CNNMoney it's only that high at some banks -- not all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some put it even higher, at 8%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The New York Times cited quiet complaints from banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But CNNMoney spoke to the nation's largest banks, an association of community banks and Apple (AAPL, Tech30).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The takeaway?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This high level of fraud isn't really widespread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Banks also make this point: Banks get stuck with fraud costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Yet dozens of small banks are in a long line to join Apple Pay by the end of 2015, according to L.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cary Whaley III, a technology policy expert at Independent Community Bankers of America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Why would they want to join if fraud is truly rampant?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Still, neither Apple nor the major banks would say what level of fraud they're seeing on Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Those who worry about Apple Pay fraud say it's happening because it's too easy to load up credit cards on an iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But Apple and its largest bank partners pointed out that they carefully authenticate customers every time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"During setup Apple Pay requires banks to verify each and every card," an Apple spokesperson said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The bank then determines and approves whether a card can be added to Apple Pay."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>CNNMoney tested this out by setting up Apple Pay with debit and credit cards issued by several banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The authentication process was indeed robust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Bank of America (BAC) requires a phone conversation in which you must state your name, card number, driver's license number and the details of the latest check you wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) send you a one-time verification code to the email or phone number it has on file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>According to its website, American Express (AXP) also uses a one-time code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sometimes the company even calls the customer to double check it's actually them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In all these cases, you also get an alert from the bank that says you set up Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Combined, these are big barriers for the typical fraudster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>So, if there's a high rate of fraud, why is it happening?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Industry sources say there's only one possible hole: Not all banks are doing Apple Pay setup right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Some make it too easy without making sure you're actually you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Consider that a lot goes on in the background too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>When you add a new card on an iPhone, Apple sends the bank your current location, the last four digits of your phone number, a snapshot of recent iTunes purchases, and it tells the bank how long you've used that card on iTunes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It's up to the bank to use that information to make sure it's you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>For example, if you live in New York but you add a card in Miami, that should raise flags at the bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It's the same if you add a card to a phone that's different than the one your bank has on file, or if your iTunes purchases don't match up with the bank's records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Two companies with knowledge of the Apple Pay process say that some banks ignore this data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>So, if someone steals your card and uses it on Apple Pay, blame your bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Then again, Apple could fix this by demanding stricter verification from banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>That's the point made by Mike Dudas, a former Google Wallet executive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"It is both a bank and an Apple problem... but since Apple controls the platform, they can dictate the best practices," said Dudas, who's now at the startup Button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Related: What's the difference between Apple Pay and Samsung Pay?</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Related: Why was your credit card number stolen?</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Retailers are lazy.</td></tr>
