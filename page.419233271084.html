<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Soccer Canada's Montagliani joins FIFA reform task force Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Canada Soccer president Victor Montagliani is joining Francois Carrard's FIFA reform task force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Carrard, who helped oversee cleaning up the IOC after the Salt Lake City bidding scandal, will chair a group leading reforms of soccer's corruption-hit governing body and Montagliani is one of 12 officials that have been picked by the six soccer continental confederations, plus two chosen by World Cup sponsors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Montagliani was appointed by CONCACAF as one of the region's representatives to the committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The world of football is changing, and I look forward to being part of that change at FIFA," Montagliani said in a release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Football fans have made it clear that comprehensive reform is required at every level of the game. It is now our responsibility to put the proper structures in place to promote transparency and good governance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Montagliani is also a member of CONCACAF's executive committee and was named in May to the special committee tasked to evaluate and sustain all of the business operations of the confederation, which oversees North, South and Central America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Canada was one of the nations that voted against the election of incumbent FIFA president Sepp Blatter on May 29 in the wake of a joint American and Swiss investigation of the governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Although Blatter won another term he announced his resignation on June 2 amidst the ongoing corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Carrard, former director general of the International Olympic Committee, was chosen Tuesday to lead the reform committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The selection of new FIFA executive committee member Sheik Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah of Kuwait as a member of the reform team confirmed the IOC powerbroker's growing influence in world soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>By now including sponsors in the project, FIFA acknowledged its growing anxiety since 14 people were indicted and four more made guilty pleas in the American federal investigation of racketeering and bribery in international soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's a very big crisis," Carrard said in a conference call with reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The objective is to get acceptable reforms to the world and to restore FIFA's credibility."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Carrard set a mid-September target for the panel's first meeting and acknowledged that a Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>24-25 meeting of FIFA's executive committee in Zurich was a "very tight" deadline to report much progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Swiss lawyer served as the IOC's director general for 14 years until 2003, a period which included the scandal that led to the expulsion or resignation of 10 members connected to Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The scandal prompted the IOC to enact a series of reforms, including the creation of an ethics commission, the introduction of new term and age limits and a ban on member visits to bid cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Reform proposals being discussed for Blatter's successor as FIFA president and executive committee members include term limits, publishing their salary and stricter vetting of candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Carrard's team includes three members of FIFA's often-discredited executive committee, whose seats could be voted on in future by soccer leaders worldwide instead of their home continent alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Amid skepticism by World Cup sponsors and FIFA critics that his task force would lack both independence and figures from outside the world of football, Carrard said input from so many confederation officials was "an asset."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Though Carrard praised previous FIFA anti-corruption advisers led by Swiss law professor Mark Pieth for providing "pillars" for his panel, he suggested people from within the sport could achieve more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"At some point these outsiders are sitting on the clouds. You have to be in the eye of the storm and moving the reforms with the people inside," said Carrard, who will call on some outside help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Carrard will choose up to five people to form an advisory board that will review his reform proposals to the FIFA executive committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Final approval is by FIFA's 209 member federations when they also elect their new president in Zurich on Feb. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Blatter said Carrard can "help FIFA to strengthen its governance structures in a credible and meaningful way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>UEFA President Michel Platini, the front-runner to succeed Blatter and inherit the reforms, said creating the panel was an important step.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"All of the confederations have picked their representatives based on their knowledge of football and governance matters, and we will now all work together for the greater good of the game," Platini said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Platini's right-hand man at UEFA, general secretary Gianni Infantino, and legal director Alasdair Bell are on Carrard's team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The panel also includes former IOC vice-president Kevan Gosper, who was appointed by the Asian Football Confederation.</td></tr>
