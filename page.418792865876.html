<h3>Tunisia overwhelmingly passes anti-terror law</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) - Tunisia's parliament has voted overwhelmingly to pass the country's new anti-terror law despite fears by rights groups that it could be abused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a late-night session Friday, 174 deputies voted for the legislation, 10 abstained and no one voted against it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The law replaces earlier legislation from 2003 and is designed to facilitate efforts to combat terrorism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Discussion over the law, especially whether it might open the way to rights abuses, stretched on for years but was given new impetus with a pair of devastating attacks on tourists in March at a Tunis museum and then last month a beach resort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The sole country to emerge from the 2011 uprisings with a democracy, Tunisia has been targeted by militant groups.</td></tr>
