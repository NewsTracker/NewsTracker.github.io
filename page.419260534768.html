<h3>Here's all the sexist things that Donald Trump has ever said</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Somehow, it seems to have only made Trump more popular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But then again, he's well practiced - Trump is no stranger to a sexist comment, and we've scoured the web to find a few of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A complete list would probably be so long that it would break your browser, but we've tried our best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ariana Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post, is a fairly common target of Trump's jibes, usually because her liberal media outlet tends to disagree with Trump on a number of political issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Naturally, he's chosen to show his dislike for her very explicitly and publicly on Twitter in the past - calling her "extremely unattractive" and making fun of her divorce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>How much money is the extremely unattractive (both inside and out) Arianna Huffington paying her poor ex-hubby for the use of his name?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This moment came on The Apprentice, in which Trump fills the role of Alan Sugar on the British version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When it came to the always-agonising bit where the contestants argue about when they shouldn't be fired, Poison singer Bret Michaels said that during a task in which the team failed, former playmate Brande Roderick "got down on her knees and passionately said, 'I want to do this'."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After a moment of silence, Trump says to Roderick: "It must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Her facial expression says it all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In his magnum opus, Trump 101: The Way to Success, he writes: "Beauty and elegance, whether in a woman, a building, or a work of art, is not just superficial or something pretty to see."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The women of the world should be flattered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For a multi-billionaire with an ambition to become the Leader of the Free World, some of Trump's insults are fairly playground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"@ForeverMcIn: @realDonaldTrump how much would it take for you to make out with Rosie O'Donnell?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>One trillion, at least!</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Rosie O'Donnell presumably breathed a heavy sigh of relief after this tweet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As reported by the New York Times, this comment came while Trump was in court, during a lawsuit over a failed property project in Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When lawyer Elizabeth Beck asked for a break, Trump and his team objected, and wanted the proceedings to continue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Trump's hair glistens before a press conference at the Republican Leadership Conference (Getty) Beck needed to feed her three-month old daughter, and pulled her breast pump out to prove it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In an outburst "not disputed by either side", Trump said: "You're disgusting," walking out of the room and ending proceedings for the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In one notable rant on Entertainment Tonight, Trump made his views on Rosie O'Donnell, the American comedian who has previously criticised him, abundantly clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We're all a little chubby but Rosie's just worse than most of us. But it's not the chubbiness - Rosie is a very unattractive person, both inside and out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In that same rant, he said: "Rosie's a person who's very lucky to have her girlfriend. And she better be careful or I'll send one of my friends over to pick up her girlfriend, why would she stay with Rosie if she had another choice?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He didn't make clear which friend he'd send, or what tactics they would use to "pick up" O'Donnell's girlfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Referring to Trump's bankruptcy rumours, New York Times journalist Gail Collins called Trump a "financially embattled thousandaire" in print.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In reponse, Trump allegedly sent Collins a copy of her column, with her face circled and the words "Face of a dog!" written over it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In April, a message that claimed Hillary Clinton "couldn't satisfy her husband" was retweeted by Trump's official account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Obviously, it refers to former President Bill Clinton's famous affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Hey @realDonaldTrump - In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted..</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Thankfully, the tweet was quickly deleted, and Trump's office said that one of the 10 staff members who look after his Twitter account was responsible for the retweet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Fortunately, some other users decided to save the screenshot for posterity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>This tweet was about a study that found 26,000 sexual assaults in the military went unreported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Rather than questioning why so many assaults went unreported, or looking into the failures of the military justice system, Trump chose to blame this depressing statistic on the fact that men and women can serve together and live on the same military bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Speaking to The Daily News in 2004, The Donald said: "all of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Trump at a red carpet event for The Apprentice, the show where all the women flirt with him (Getty) Could Trump's high polling figures be due to the fact he is irresistible to women?</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>There's a lot of entries on this list, but it's safe to assume that Trump isn't going to be upset by it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>After all, as he told Esquire in 1991, "You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>69-year-old Trump is currently married to 45-year-old Melania Knauss-Trump, but he's made jokes in the past about his own habit of dating younger women.</td></tr>
