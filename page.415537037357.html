<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Atletico Madrid, which lost last year's final to Real Madrid, defeated Bayer Leverkusen 3-2 on penalty kicks after the Spanish team won 1-0 on Mario Suarez's 27th-minute goal to leave the aggregate 1-1 after overtime.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>Olivier Giroud scored in the 36th minute and substitute Aaron Ramsey in the 79th, but Arsenal fell short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We've always gone out to Bayern Munich and Barcelona at this stage but, no disrespect to Monaco, we thought we'd have a good opportunity to qualify. But we gave ourselves a tough test from the first leg," Ramsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's nearly again, but it's not enough."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Arsenal was knocked out in the round of 16 for the fifth straight year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's always difficult to turn a three-goal deficit around," said Gunners manager Arsene Wenger, who coached Monaco for seven years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Tonight we did not seize all our chances, and we were made to pay for our first-leg inadequacies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There are two French clubs in the last eight for the first time in five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Monaco lost the 2004 final to Porto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In Madrid, Raul Garcia opened the shootout by putting his attempt over the crossbar, and Atletico's Jan Oblak saved Hakan Calhanoglu's shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Antoine Griezmann put the hosts ahead, Simon Rolfes tied it and Mario Suarez gave Atletico a 2-1 advantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Omer Toprak sent Leverkusen's third shot too high, Koke's try was saved by Bernd Leno and Gonzalo Castro tied it 2-all with Leverkusen's fourth shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Fernando Torres put Atletico back in front, and Stefan Kiessling shot high, giving Atletico the win.</td></tr>

<h3>Championship round-up: Bournemouth slip up at Cardiff and Brentford give their promotion hopes a boost with a vital win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Harry Arter fired in from range to give Eddie Howe's men an early lead, before Bruno Ecuele-Manga made the wasteful Cherries pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Middlesborough's triumph at Derby and Watford's win against Wigan means Bournemouth slip two points behind the automatic places into third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Andre Gray's 84th-minute winner severely dented Blackburn's aims of finishing in the Sky Bet Championship play-off spots as sixth-placed Brentford moved 11 points clear of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gray came off the bench to score a fortuitous winner six minutes from time after the Bees had earlier twice come from behind to record a 3-2 win which maintained their all-important position in the top six.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinical finishes from Rudy Gestede and Chris Taylor either side of Chris Long's deflected effort had given Rovers a half-time lead as they looked to cut the gap on their opponents to five points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, after Jota had levelled early in the second half, Gray scored a goal which may have ended Blackburn's' top-six aspirations once and for all with eight games to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Charlton made it four Sky Bet Championship wins in their last five games with a 3-0 victory over bottom side Blackpool at a deserted Bloomfield Road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Simon Church's second-half strike doubled the visitors' lead after Chris Eagles had put them in front in the first period against his old club and Johann Berg Gudmundsson's third added insult to injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Blackpool are now without a win in their last 10 games and have lost their last six - taking their tally of defeats in the league to 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Jay Tabb scored a priceless 79th minute winner as Ipswich Town got their play-off dreams back on track with a 1-0 win over Bolton Wanderers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The midfielder earned Ipswich their first win in five matches after a dour match at Portman Road that seemed destined to end goalless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Bolton, who have not won away for two months, were guilty of missing some golden chances through impressive debutant Rochinha and Craig Davies in the final minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>PLAY NOW TO WIN with Coral...</td></tr>
