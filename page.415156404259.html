<h3>Iraq launches operation to retake Tikrit from Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Previous attempts to capture the symbolic city have failed, and hours into Monday's operation, the military said it still hadn't entered Tikrit, indicating a long battle lies ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Retaking it will help Iraqi forces secure a major supply link for any future operation to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city which has been under militant rule since June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>State-run Al-Iraqiya television said that forces were attacking from different directions, backed by artillery and airstrikes by Iraqi fighter jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It said the militants were dislodged from some areas outside the city, but several hours into the operation, it gave no additional details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tikrit, the provincial capital of Salauhddin province, 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Baghdad, fell to the Islamic State group last summer, along with Mosul and other areas in the country's Sunni heartland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>U.S. military officials have said a coordinated military mission to retake Mosul will likely begin in April or May and involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the Americans have cautioned that if the Iraqis aren't ready, the offensive could be delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The U.S.-led coalition launching airstrikes targeting the Islamic State group was not involved in the Tikrit operation, Iraqi officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Pentagon spokesman, Army Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Steve Warren, said the U.S. was alerted to the offensive before it started Monday but was not asked to provide air power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Right now we are not providing any air power to support the Iraqi operation in the city of Tikrit," Warren told reporters in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We did note the Iraqi government's statements that they are emphasizing minimization of collateral damage, and we are continuing to monitor it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Iraqi forces apparently have the help of Iranian Gen. Ghasem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, who arrived two days ago, the Iranian semi-official Fars news agency reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The powerful general has emerged as the chief tactician in Iraq's fight against the Sunni militants, working on the front lines alongside dozens of advisers from his country's Revolutionary Guard to direct Shiite militiamen and government forces in the smallest details of battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fars also reported drones were flying over Tikrit, without identifying whether they were Iranian or Iraqi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The military commander of Salahuddin region, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, told state TV fighting was taking place outside Tikrit mainly on its eastern side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Until this moment we have not entered the city," al-Saadi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"God willing, we will enter, but we need some time as planned. & God willing, victory will be achieved and Salahuddin will be turned into a grave for all terrorist groups."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tikrit is an important test case for Iraq's Shiite-led government, which is trying to reassert authority over the divided country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Islamic State fighters have a strong presence in the city and are expected to put up fierce resistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Past attempts to retake Tikrit have failed, as Iraq struggles with its armed forces, which collapsed in the wake of the Islamic State group's offensive last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The offensive comes as momentum has begun to shift since Iraqi soldiers, backed by airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition, took back the nearby refinery town of Beiji in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Any operation to take Mosul would require Iraq to seize Tikrit first because of its strategic location for military enforcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Islamic State chemical attack may be possible in U.S.</td></tr>
