<h3>Erdogan, Turkish Cypriot leader urge Greek Cypriots to step up peace efforts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ANKARA, May 6 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and the newly elected north Cypriot leader said on Wednesday that renewed peace talks between Cyprus's estranged Turkish and Greek communities could lead to a solution this year if the Greek side shows more commitment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We will make efforts to make 2015 year of the solution, but this doesn't depend just on us," Mustafa Akinci said after a meeting with Erdogan in Ankara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was their first meeting since Akinci was elected on April 26, pledging fresh impetus in solving the conflict which has split the Mediterranean island for decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Though welcoming Akinci's election, Greek Cypriots say any Cyprus settlement is contingent on Turkey, which bankrolls Turkish Cypriots and has some 30,000 troops in the heavily militarised breakaway state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At a joint news conference, Akinci and Erdogan said they aimed for a speedy resumption to stalled peace talks and called on Greek Cypriots to take steps toward peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It is time for the Greek Cypriots to show sincere efforts as well," Erdogan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If that happens, we believe it is possible for 2015 to be the year of solution".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Akinci is due to meet Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades to revive peace talks, which stalled last October, although an initial meeting was postponed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Erdogan showed no sign of animosity towards Akinci, days after criticising him for suggesting relations with Turkey should be on more equal footing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Who's the one fighting for northern Cyprus in the international community? Does Mr. Akinci believe he can put up this fight on his own?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Erdogan had said at the time, adding that Turkey would continue to view northern Cyprus as a "mother looks at its child".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Greek Cypriot-controlled south represents the whole island in the European Union, although membership is in political limbo in the north, a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While communication between Greek and Turkish Cypriots was severed for years, Akinci was an exception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As mayor of the ethnically split Cypriot capital Nicosia in the 1980s, he and his Greek Cypriot counterpart worked on a plan for the city, with the hope it would be reunited.</td></tr>
