<h3>MH17: Fragments may be 'smoking gun' that proves Buk missile shot down plane</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The wreckage of flight MH17 in a hangar at Gilze-Rijen airbase, Netherlands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Metal fragments recovered from a field in eastern Ukraine may be the 'smoking gun' that proves a Buk surface-to-air missile shot down flight MH17 last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Expert investigators announced on Tuesday that they were examining several parts, possibly originating from a Buk missile system, which were recovered from eastern Ukraine in the area where MH17 came down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Debris from the crash in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17," said a joint statement by the Dutch Safety Board, which is co-ordinating the air safety investigation, and the Joint Investigation Team which runs the criminal investigation into the tragedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The JIT will further investigate the origin of the parts, enlisting international experts including forensic specialists and weapon experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However the DSB and JIT said it was too early to be certain of the nature and source of the parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Australian Federal Police officers and their Dutch counterparts at the MH17 crash site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"At present the conclusion cannot be drawn that there is a causal connection between the discovered parts and the crash of flight MH17," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The parts will be covered in the DSB's report, which is due in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The international team producing the report - including flight safety experts form Australia - are this week examining a reconstruction of the cockpit and part of the business class cabin from MH17, rebuilt from parts recovered from Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The plane crashed in Ukraine's east on July 17, 2014, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew members aboard - including 39 people who called Australia home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The meeting of experts which began on Monday is intended to hash out their final conclusions after a two-month review of a draft report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As well as discussing the progress of the investigation they will visit air force base Gilze-Rijen to view the reconstruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However the meeting may also feature heated argument, as Russia has flagged it is unhappy with the draft report's reasoning and its conclusion which blames Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine's east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The experts from Australia, Malaysia, Ukraine, Russia, the US and UK will discuss two draft reports on the crash: one on its cause, and another that assesses whether the plane should have been assigned its given flight path.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Dutch Safety Board sent the draft reports to those countries' flight safety boards in June, with 60 days assigned for them to respond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The final report is due in October, however some details have leaked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In July CNN said the draft report pointed to pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine having shot down the plane using a Buk missile launched from a village under their control.</td></tr>
