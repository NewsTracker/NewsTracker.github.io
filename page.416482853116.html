<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>IS SOMEONE bitter about the Apple Watch launch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An obscene image of the Android mascot urinating on the Apple logo has been spotted in Google Maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The illustration shows the Google mascot peeing on the search company's biggest rival, Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last year, Google and Apple reached a settlement and issued a truce on their global patent infringement claims against one another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google has hidden the taunt in Pakistan - around 15miles South of Islamabad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The picture is only visible when viewing Google Maps in regular mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some parts of Google's popular mapping data are editable by users however this toilet-based humour has been placed in the base terrain - which is only accessible by Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is not yet known whether the image was hidden in the map by a disgruntled Google engineer or whether the Californian giant simply wanted to take some of the wind out of Apple's sails on the launch of its hugely-anticipated Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The obscene illustration was discovered by a few eagle eyed bloggers at Team Android, earlier today.</td></tr>
