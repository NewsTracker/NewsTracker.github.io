<h3>Grandfather could testify in Alabama girl's running death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - The husband of an Alabama woman charged in her granddaughter's running death could be a witness in her upcoming capital murder trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Court documents show prosecutors have subpoenaed Johnny Garrard in the trial of his wife, 59-year-old Joyce Hardin Garrard of Boaz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The woman is accused of making granddaughter Savannah Hardin run until she collapsed and died in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Initial jury qualification is done, and final selection begins next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Documents filed Friday don't indicate why prosecutors might seek testimony from Garrard's husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But arguments at a past hearing suggested he was at the scene at least briefly on the day authorities say Savannah collapsed after running around the yard for hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The defense says Garrard is innocent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It blames the child's death on other medical problems and treatment decisions.</td></tr>
