<h3>Nelson Shanks claims he put reference to Monica Lewinsky's infamous blue dress in Bill Clinton painting that hangs in National Portrait Gallery?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Pennsylvania artist Nelson Shanks said that he slipped a Monica Lewinsky reference into the full-body portrait because the scandal was something he could never get 'completely out of his mind'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The painter said that the reference to former President Clinton's affair with the former White House intern was in the shadows of the painting, in the form of her infamous blue dress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Presidential: The full-body painting of Bill Clinton debuted in the National Portrait Gallery in 2006 (pictured above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Scandal: Circled on the left, there's a shadow under the mantle that's in the silhouette of a dress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'If you look at the left-hand side of it there's a mantle in the Oval Office and I put a shadow coming into the painting and it does two things,' Shanks told Philly.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He added: 'It actually literally represents a shadow from a blue dress that I had on a mannequin, that I had there while I was painting it, but not when he was there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shanks, who's painted portraits of Princess Diana and Pope John Paul II, also said that Clinton was the 'most famous liar of all time'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The portrait caused controversy when it first was revealed in 2006 because it looks like Clinton is not wearing a wedding band, according to the New York Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And according to Shanks, the Clintons 'hate the portrait' and are 'putting a lot of pressure' on the National Portrait Gallery to remove it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But a spokeswoman for the gallery has denied those accusations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>When the painting was first debuted in 2006, it seemed as though Bill Clinton was quite pleased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'I think the painting really feels like Bill Clinton,' he said then, according to the Washington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'It has - I would not call it swagger... What?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An informality?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Shanks's most famous works include Princess Diana, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Luciano Pavarotti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In 2009 the artist was awarded the Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement by the Portrait Society of America, while in 2011 he was voted an honorary member into the Russian Academy for his works of art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Shanks said because of the Lewinsky controversy, Clinton was the hardest person for him to paint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Lewinsky, who was 22 when she started interning at the White House claimed to have sexual relations with Clinton nine times between 1995 and 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Clinton initially swore under oath that he 'did not have sexual relations' with Lewinsky but later admitted that he had misled the American public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lewinsky revealed her relationship with the president involved oral sex but not sexual intercourse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She famously kept a blue dress which she claimed held DNA evidence of their affair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In late July, 1998, Monica had to turn a dress over to Kenneth Starr's investigators after signing an immunity agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Clinton, however, was found not guilty and though he was impeached, he remained in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>And with speculations that Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, might launch her 2016 presidential bid in April, Bill Clinton could be back in office within two years.</td></tr>

<h3>Ebola survivor sues Dallas hospital over infection</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the suit against Texas Health Resources (THR) in Dallas County Court, Pham claims the hospital did not initially provide nurses with proper protective equipment or properly train staff on how to treat the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The suit accuses the hospital of negligence and deception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It does not specify an amount in damages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pham, 26, was one of two nurses at the Dallas hospital who contracted the disease when treating Thomas Duncan, who was admitted in late September and died less than two weeks later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Both nurses recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Duncan contracted the disease in Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pham became a national symbol of hope in fighting Ebola after she made a recovery and was greeted in the Oval Office by President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The suit claims that the THR's Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital did not initially provide adequate protective gear for medical staff or instructions on how to treat someone with Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It also describes a hospital in chaos, where medical waste that could have carried the virus was left to pile up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The nurses were just using their best guesses and their instincts to protect themselves," the suit said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The hospital did not address the details of Pham's accusations and said in a statement: "As distressing as the lawsuit is to us, we remain optimistic that we can resolve this matter with Nina."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pham claims the hospital used her as a "public relations pawn" to improve its plummeting image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While it issued news releases saying her condition had improved to "good," it was having end of life conversations with her, Pham alleges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Pham said the hospital did not respect her right to privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In one instance, she was videotaped speaking to a doctor and the video was released to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pham said both the taping and release happened without her permission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I was hoping that THR would be more open and honest about everything that happened at the hospital, and the things they didn't do that led to me getting infected with Ebola. But that didn't happen and I felt I was left with no choice but to turn to the courts for help," Pham said in a statement.</td></tr>
