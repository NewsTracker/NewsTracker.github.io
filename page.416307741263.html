<h3>US troops arrive in Ukraine for training exercises</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, left,joined the Ukrainian military earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now comes word American soldiers will start training Ukrainian national guard troops, a move Russia is not pleased about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>MOSCOW (AP) - About 300 US Army paratroopers have arrived in Ukraine for training exercises with national guard units, a move criticized by the Kremlin and eastern Ukraine's Russia-backed separatist rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The troops, from the Italy-based 173rd Airborne Brigade, are to spend several weeks training a total of about 900 Ukrainian national guardsmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Although Interior Minister Arsen Avakov had said the guardsman units could include the Azov Battalion, a far-right formation notorious for using an insignia used by many military units in Nazi Germany, U.S. Embassy spokesman James Hallock said Azov fighters would not be among those trained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Though fighting has diminished substantially since a February cease-fire deal was signed in Minsk, Belarus, clashes continue and each side accuses the other of wanting to resume the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Friday, the UN Human Rights Commissioner's office said at least 6,116 people have been killed since the fighting broke out a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>National guard units, many of which began as volunteer groupings, have been an important part of Ukrainian forces' fighting against the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Two national guard units, working on weeklong rotations, are holding the town of Shyrokyne, currently the most fraught location in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Shyrokyne is just east of the major port city of Mariupol, which Ukraine fears rebels aim to seize to establish a land corridor between the Russian mainland and the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, criticized the American move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The participation of instructors and specialists from a third country on the territory of Ukraine, where an unresolved intra-Ukrainian conflict remains, where problems persist in carrying out the Minsk agreement, is far from helping resolve the conflict. To the contrary, it enables destabilizing the situation," Peskov said.</td></tr>
