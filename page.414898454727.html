<h3>Watch Martin Short, Fallon Trade Fake Bill Paxton Stories in 'Word Sneak'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The game's objective is simple: work a series of random words and phrases into a conversation "as casually and as seamlessly as possible" - and in this case, it led to an extended back-and-forth on Paxton's back hair and public drunkenness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the above clip, Fallon opens by asking Short what it's like working on Broadway opposite Matthew Broderick in It's Only a Play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Short sneaks in the word "enchiladas" by discussing the importance of avoiding onstage gas and shoehorns "Cialis" by noting that Broadway performers should "come on strong and hard."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The game truly takes off when Short is forced to sneak "Bill Paxton" into the bizarre rant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This leads to a story about the actor getting drunk in the audience of Short's play, getting into a shirtless scuffle with security (and exposing his "back hair") and wrestling Fallon (whose "feet got stuck to his back hair," almost as if he were wearing "velcro shoes").</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Times are good for Short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Besides his acclaimed Broadway turn, the actor-comedian released a memoir, I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend, in November and turned heads with his recent role as a druggy dentist in Paul Thomas Anderson's film Inherent Vice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He also appeared as a regular on John Mulaney's Fox sitcom, Mulaney, which ended its first season this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>More recently, Short appeared with Beyonce (as portrayed by Maya Rudolph) for an outrageous musical-comedy homage for the epic SNL 40.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Last year, Short spoke to Rolling Stone about his varied accomplishments - and revealed his comedic secrets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Basically, a funny look is a surefire way to get a laugh," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"That, and falling down."</td></tr>

<h3>World Health Organization approves 1st quick test for Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit, made by Colorado-based Corgenix, met sufficient quality, safety and performance requirements to allow it to be purchased and distributed by U.N. agencies and aid groups, WHO said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It may definitely help the response. I wouldn't say it's a game-changer," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO's assistant director-general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Until now, Ebola tests have been mainly conducted in laboratories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>These gene-based tests are more accurate but can take between 12 and 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new test can provide results within 15 minutes by detecting an Ebola protein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In trials it correctly identified 92 percent of the patients with Ebola and 85 percent of those not infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Medical personnel will still need to conduct a backup test when someone tests negative, said Aylward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"But (the new test) might help us get to zero faster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Almost 24,000 people have been infected and nearly 9,400 people have died from the current Ebola outbreak, which began in West Africa over a year ago.</td></tr>
