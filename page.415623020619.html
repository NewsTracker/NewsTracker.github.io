<h3>Confidence in Ukraine's cease-fire hurt by arms violations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Their task is to verify whether government troops and Russian-backed rebel forces are removing heavy weapons from the front line in accordance with a February cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The success of the Organization for Security and Europe monitoring mission would lessen the chances that heavy fighting will resume in conflict that has already left more than 6,000 dead in a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Evidence is emerging, however, that the warring sides are leading monitors on a time-wasting game of hide-and-seek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Friday, an Associated Press journalist saw two tanks and two 120 mm caliber guns being taken toward the front in rebel territory, near the separatist-held city of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two days earlier, Ukrainian troops were seen transporting a tank and a large-caliber gun in the town of Avdiivka, which also lies right on the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>None of the weapons should have been there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Under a peace deal laboriously negotiated between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, anything with a caliber of 100 mm or above should be pulled back 50-to-140 kilometers (30-to-90 miles) from the front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The weapons withdrawal began the last week of February and both sides claim to have completed the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the OSCE says to make sure the pullbacks happened, it must know how many weapons each side has and where they are being stored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Some information has been provided from both sides, but we still need substantial information," said Michael Bociurkiw, the OSCE mission spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Friday, a group of inspectors in rebel territory traveled from Donetsk to Novoamvrosiivske, a village near the Russian border where AP journalists on Feb. 26 followed four trucks carrying Grad launchers to a cement factory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In that same cement factory, monitors scrutinized dozens of tanks, rocket launchers and howitzers, eyeing serial plates, taking photos and writing down notes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Where serial numbers were scratched away, a photo was taken of that missing information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In separatist areas, OSCE teams have to ask in advance for permission to visit sites they wish to see and they travel under the supervision of rebel fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They have complained to us that they can move around freely on Ukrainian territory," one rebel fighter, who gave his name as Major Yegorov, told the AP in Novoamvrosiivske.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"That is true, but on that territory there is no fighting. The war is here, in the southeast. So we control them because we want to provide safety for them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It is unclear to what extent the OSCE teams are able to decide on their own where to inspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On the road back to Donetsk after the Novoamvrosiivske inspection, fresh tracks on the asphalt in the Donetsk suburb of Makiivka appeared to indicate that a convoy of heavy machinery had passed through since the morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The OSCE team drove past, but an AP journalist followed the tracks to find two tanks in a multi-vehicle convoy that included truck-pulled cannons and troop carriers full of rebel fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Wednesday, two days earlier, a Ukrainian soldier told an AP reporter, laughing, that a cease-fire agreement-busting cannon that was being taken toward the front had a "90-something mm caliber."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The weapon was clearly more powerful than that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Ukrainian military officials have at times conceded that they are refraining from a complete withdrawal of heavy weapons, citing what they say is rebel reluctance to do the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We will not withdraw all our weapons, as we have no confirmation that the same is being done by the enemy," military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters March 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"It would be wrong and criminal to leave our troops without any cover."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And Ukrainian authorities say artillery fire continues in sporadic clashes along the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Donetsk region police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said a resident of Avdiivka was killed Friday after a shell struck a home in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In addition, neither side is willing to agree that tanks fall under the weapons to be withdrawn, although the cease-fire clearly envisions their removal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Monitors complain daily that they are not being allowed to travel freely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sometimes they are made to wait at checkpoints, forcing delays, while in more extreme cases they are blocked entirely from reaching their destination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Bociurkiw said even a short wait violates the verification process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>An OSCE monitor inspects a cannon stored by pro-Russian rebels in the village of Novoamvrosiivske, eastern Ukraine, Friday, March 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The OSCE was tasked to verify the pullback of heavy weapons by the Ukrainian government forces and the rebels in eastern Ukraine under a cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A pro-Russian rebel stands on guard in a storage for cannons in the village of Novoamvrosiivske, eastern Ukraine, Friday, March 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A pro-Russian rebel, partly visible, watches OSCE monitors inspect heavy weapons stored by pro-Russian rebels in the village of Novoamvrosiivske, eastern Ukraine, Friday, March 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A badge on a rebel's arm shows a Russian flag and reads "Artillery. The Russians don't abandon their kin."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>OSCE monitors inspect a cannon and Grad rocket launchers stored by pro-Russian rebels in the village of Novoamvrosiivske, eastern Ukraine, Friday, March 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>An OSCE monitor inspects Grad rocket launchers stored by pro-Russian rebels in the village of Novoamvrosiivske, eastern Ukraine, Friday, March 20, 2015.</td></tr>

<h3>Juneau-based state ferry bartender takes 1 last ride</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Without cellphone service and surrounded by friends and adventurous strangers, anything can happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For 20 years, Tony Tengs was there to see to that, the Juneau Empire (http://bit.ly/1BMPHTC) reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Juneau-born Tengs was taking his last trip to Bellingham, Wash., as a bartender this month, as the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities gears up to shut down ferry bars, a friendly vestige of simpler times and an institution for the frequent AMHS traveler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Call it a crisis, a deficit or a shortfall - at an estimated $3.5 billion in the red, the state's coffers can't afford to pay for any extras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>To the dismay of anyone who has ever had a drink with Tengs on duty, that includes six of the ferries' bars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The closure will save the state more than $750,000 annually, according to a DOT news release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The department will attempt to reassign bar employees within the ferry system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tengs invited his Juneau friends to spend a day on "what we call the turnaround" - the boat travels from Juneau to Haines and Skagway and back before heading on to Bellingham, the trip he's made about every other week in the busy summer season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Go up and ride back down with me in the bar, and just enjoy the trip," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I am going to have a party in Bellingham when I visit, so it's kind of historic for me, and then I will not be doing that anymore."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Visiting Bellingham often has served as a link with the Lower 48 that not many in insulated Southeast Alaska get to experience many times a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While in the town, the most southerly node of the ferry system, Tengs would explore, run errands and "buy some great books and magazines."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Over the years, he made good friends because he visited so frequently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I do like getting off and being able to get things that you just can't get in Juneau," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I've had friends come and meet me from Seattle and Vancouver, and there have been occasions when I've driven to Seattle and back on that day on those errands. It was risky, the traffic was risky, but I made it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The weather is great in Bellingham and it always seems to be the opposite of what it is here. It's always nice to have a good sunny day and connect with some friends and run some errands."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the best thing about his two decades on board, Tengs said, has been meeting "so many interesting people" at sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Some quasi-celebrities, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said his favorite ferry anecdote is "meeting the guy that (Dick) Cheney shot" in a 2006 hunting accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"You don't really get celebrities on the ferry but you end up meeting people that are under the radar," Tengs said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I met him before he got shot by Cheney."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He said he looked on the television news one day and, "lo and behold, there he was."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He's also been the impromptu MC for many a live ferry concert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He's encouraged musicians to unpack their instruments - whatever they are - and perform in the lounge of the 40-year-old MV Columbia, "a very amazing place ... I wouldn't say retro, it's vintage."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I will miss live music," Tengs said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I have a P.A. and I have an acoustic guitar and microphones. We encourage people to play live music in the bar. That gets to be part of the character of the bar ... There's been some fabulous stuff happen. I've heard bassoonists play, I heard a solo bassoonist a year ago and it was fabulous."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The main reason Tengs got his start with the ferry system was because "you sort of run your own show when you're there," and can make your days-long shift at the bar whatever you want it to be - for you and your patrons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Well, that and "the bartender got his own room" on the vessel, Tengs said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"So, that was an attraction, to have my own room," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Partly it was something I had done in the past. My father ran a bar in Haines (the Pioneer Bar and attached Bamboo Room restaurant), and I sort of grew up in that place and I knew how to bar-tend."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>No matter at land or at sea, AMHS customers are true to their brew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Tengs said the most popular drink in his 20 years was - you guessed it - Alaskan Brewing Co. beer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The favorite cocktail was "probably ... whiskey and Coke," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Although it changes "in streaks depending on what people are doing."</td></tr>
