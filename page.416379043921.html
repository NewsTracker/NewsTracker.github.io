<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Sunday evening meeting came amid a quickening rapprochement between the longtime allies after Washington in March lifted a partial freeze on its $1.5 billion annual aid to Egypt that it imposed when then-army chief Sisi ousted elected president Mohamed Morsi in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The meeting underscored the strong ties between Egypt and the USA and the importance of their strategic relationship as well as their commitment to promote relations," a statement from the president's office said.</td></tr>
