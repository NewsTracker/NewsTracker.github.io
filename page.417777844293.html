<h3>Greece last-chance IMF talks end with no deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Last-ditch talks between Greece and its EU-IMF creditors have ended with no deal on Sunday, setting the countdown towards a disastrous default by Athens with the threat of a Greek exit from the euro closer than ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The crunch negotiations failed in their second day, heaping worry that the cash-starved Greek government was heading irreversibly into a financial abyss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"While some progress was made the talks did not succeed as there remains a significant gap between the plans of the Greek authorities and the joint requirements of the (European) Commission, ECB and IMF," a EU spokesperson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>All sides had agreed the talks were the last chance for Athens to unlock vital bailout cash in return for reforms that Greece's 40-year-old, tie-eschewing prime minister Alexis Tsipras still doggedly refuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard commented in an official blog that there were "tough choices and tough commitments to be made on both sides".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greek officials said the failure to strike a deal was the fault of the IMF, the country's most hardline creditor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They came with their hands in their pockets," a furious source close to the negotiations told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The demands of the creditors are irrational, the discussions lasted 45 minutes," a Greek government source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The IMF's position was "intransigent and tough" because it insists on further cuts for pensions, and a rise in value-added tax on basic goods, like electricity, they added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to an EU source, savings from the reform measures put on the table by Greece fell short by 2 billion euros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Greek proposal "remains incomplete", the EU source said, and was not enough to unlock the 7.2 billion euros ($8.1 billion) still remaining in Greece's international bailout, which expires on June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"On this basis further discussions will now take place in the Eurogroup," the EU spokesperson said, referring to a meeting of eurozone finance ministers set for Thursday in Luxembourg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker "remains convinced that with stronger reform efforts on the Greek side and political will on all sides, a solution can still be found before the end of the month," the spokesperson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Things turned sour at the latest talks on Sunday evening, one European source said, with a final sit-down ending abruptly when the Greek authorities put forward their disappointing offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>All eyes will now be on the financial markets, with the feeling stronger than ever that Greece could finally be heading for an exit from the euro after five years of crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Athens stock market already crashed six percent on Friday due to news that the fed up eurozone nations were making contingency plans for a default by Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That came a day after the IMF announced that it pulled its technical team from Brussels due to a lack of progress in the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Greece is shattered economically after five years of crisis despite two rescue programs since 2010 - worth 240 billion euros - in loans owed to its European partners, led by Germany and France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The small Mediterranean nation is now buried under a mountain of debt equivalent to 180 per cent of GDP, almost twice the country's annual economic output.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>To meet the June 30 deadline, a reform deal will have to be resolved by the Thursday meeting of the eurozone's 19 finance ministers, as any deal also needs to go to many national parliaments, including in European paymaster Germany, where passage is not certain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>At the end of June, Greece also faces a huge 1.6 billion euro payment to the IMF with another 6.7 billion euros due to the European Central Bank in July and August, which Greek officials have said the government cannot afford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>European Union officials blamed the collapse on Athens, saying it had failed to offer anything new to secure the funding it needs to repay the debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Up until the collapse of talks, playing hardball seemed to have worked for Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We had promised to negotiate hard with our partners during our election campaign and that's what we did," Economy Minister Giorgos Stathakis told a local newspaper on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The comments came a day after Mr Tsipras told top officials in his Syriza party that the country "must take up the challenge" of a "difficult compromise".</td></tr>
