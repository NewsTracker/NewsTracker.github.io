<h3>Islamic State tightens its grip on Mosul residents</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Eager to live a normal life, away from the harsh dominion of the militants' self-styled caliphate, the young pair is searching for ways to bypass the extremists' newly implemented departure taxes and escape the Islamic State-held city of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Do they really want me to give up the house my father spent years building to an Afghani or Chechen or to an Iraqi villager so that I can leave for good? They are dreaming," the 29-year old groom said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Most of his family had already fled last June when a shocking Islamic State blitz overran Mosul, but he stayed behind to protect his family home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fearing the city might simply empty of civilians, or that fleeing residents may join the fight against them, the Islamic State extremists are imposing tough measures to prevent people from leaving their territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Several residents, who spoke by telephone on condition of anonymity to ensure their safety, said anyone seeking to leave must submit the title for their family home or car - if the vehicle is worth more than $20,000 - to be granted permission to leave for two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If they fail to return within that period, their property will be confiscated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Married earlier this year, they are finally ready to leave Mosul but trapped by the tough new restrictions, which were imposed in stages starting last October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The couple, who were engaged before Mosul fell, had dreamed of a lavish wedding with the traditional honking motorcade taking the bride from her father's home to the social hall for a celebration packed with friends and relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Instead we had a tiny wedding party with only three cars with modest decoration and almost no songs or music and only few relatives attended," said the 22-year old wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"What bitterness."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Islamic State group, which now controls about a third of Syria and Iraq, first banned all former police and army officers from leaving, for fear they would join the fight against Islamic State-rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Then the restrictions were tightened to allow only patients with urgent medical requirements or retirees who need to collect their pensions outside the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In late February, the requirement for travelers to turn over their home or car title was imposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Unwilling to surrender the deed to the groom's family home, the young Mosul couple found a taxi driver who moonlights as a smuggler sneaking residents out of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the pair, both civil servants, could not meet his $20,000 price tag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Trapped in their hometown, they are chafing under the Islamic State group's harsh interpretation of Islamic law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The wife has to cover herself from head to toe with an enveloping niqab garment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>When out in public together, they constantly have to show proof of their marriage at militant checkpoints.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I'm fed up, I want to live a normal life with my husband where I can go out with him at any time without worrying about our safety, the marriage documents and even without being annoyed by the niqab when eating at a restaurant," she said.</td></tr>
