<h3>Baltimore deploys Guard troops as riots erupt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thousands of police and National Guard troopers were ordered to back up beleaguered officers in Baltimore on Tuesday after riots triggered by anger over the death of a black man in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After an evening of violence, officials said calm appeared to be returning to the city as Monday gave way to Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At least 27 people were arrested and 15 police injured as stone and brick-throwing mobs, many of them high school students, clashed with law enforcement and attacked local businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The state of Maryland declared a state of emergency after furious rioters looted businesses, ransacking shops and stealing armloads of merchandise, and torched cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The violence is the latest in a series of confrontations between US police and mainly young African American young men enraged by what they see as racism in the force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last summer's fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri triggered coast-to-coast protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The unrest in Baltimore started after the funeral of a black man who died April 19 of spinal injuries apparently suffered during his arrest this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Despite appeals for calm from 25-year-old Freddie Gray's family, roving gangs of youths fought street battles with police that left 15 officers hurt, six of them seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Several news reporters were assaulted and had equipment stolen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Police said they were combing through video footage to identify other possible offenders after 27 people were arrested during the violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But as continued to light up the night sky bright orange in the early hours of Tuesday, police said calm was returning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I think for the vast majority the city is calming itself down slowly but surely, other than the car fires and the street fires," police chief Anthony Batts told a news conference shortly before midnight, urging parents to "take control of your kids."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake declared a curfew starting Tuesday night, while city schools said they would remain closed for the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While most of the violence was in the west of the city, as night fell, a large building was also ablaze on Baltimore's east side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Maryland police superintendent Colonel William Pallozzi said he had ordered 500 police to the city and requested 5,000 more from the broader Mid-Atlantic region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And National Guard commander Adjutant General Linda Singh said she had 5,000 troopers ready and would deploy them in "massive force" to protect people and property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Too many people have spent generations building up this city for it to be destroyed by thugs," said Rawlings-Blake, who has faced criticism that the city had been slow to act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>President Barack Obama was briefed on the rapidly evolving situation by Rawlings-Blake and his newly sworn in Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the White House said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The University of Maryland's downtown campus, corporate offices and the city's famous Lexington Market shut down early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Baltimore Orioles baseball team cancelled its evening game against the visiting Boston Red Sox as a precaution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rioting erupted soon after Gray was buried -- possibly spurred by a cryptic social media message declaring an after-school "purge," street slang for random acts of lawlessness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Thousands converged on New Shiloh Baptist church in Baltimore's poverty-ridden Sandtown neighborhood earlier to pay respects to Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Gray's grieving family had explicitly asked for no protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Today of all days, the family was clear this was a day of sacred closure," said pastor Jamal Bryant of the city's Empowerment Temple church, who delivered the eulogy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Violence had also erupted on Saturday when 34 people were arrested, and six police officers injured, after an orderly rally for Gray outside Baltimore city hall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Police on Monday announced they had received a "credible threat" that criminal gangs in Baltimore had "entered into a partnership to 'take out' law enforcement officers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>At the funeral, Gray's body was in a white casket next to a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap and a sign reading "Peace y'all".</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Crowds swayed to hymns, chanting "justice shall prevail, peace will prevail" in the church, where a photo of Gray was displayed among floral wreaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Supporters, many dressed in white, filled the building's 2,200 seats and hundreds of others stood, with the words "Black lives matter and all lives matter" projected on the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Tensions have been on the rise in Baltimore since Gray's death, which his family's lawyers say was caused when his spine was mostly severed following his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Six officers have been suspended with pay pending the outcome of a police investigation that is to be submitted to state prosecutors by Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The US Justice Department, which was already looking into Baltimore's use of force, has also opened a federal civil rights probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Police confirmed Gray had requested medical help and an inhaler after he was detained and have acknowledged that he should have received medical attention sooner.</td></tr>
