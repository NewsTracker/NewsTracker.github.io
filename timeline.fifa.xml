    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;LONDON (AP) - David Beckham waded into the FIFA presidential election on Tuesday, singling out former Real Madrid teammate Luis Figo in his bid to unseat Sepp Blatter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 39-year-old Beckham, who retired from soccer in 2013, has largely kept his distance from the world of FIFA politics after being part of England's failed 2018 World Cup bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I welcome the candidacy of my friend Luis for FIFA president," Beckham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FIFA will only benefit from having a wide range of strong candidates present their visions for the game and it's good to see people volunteer. I wish Luis and the other candidates well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figo is the only former player standing in the election, which also features FIFA vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein and Dutch football association chairman Michael van Praag.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
