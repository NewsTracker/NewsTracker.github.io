<h3>CANNES WATCH: Jane Fonda says gender pay gap 'unacceptable'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Jane Fonda is starring in a film at Cannes, but she also came to the film festival to pick up an honor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fonda was celebrated by the Cannes Film Festival and luxury goods company Kering for her contribution to cinema Sunday as the first honoree of the "Women in Motion" program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It recognizes the work of women on the big screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When asked about the pay divide in Hollywood, Fonda was spirited in her response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Of course it upsets me that women are still earning 30 cents per dollar less than a man earns doing exactly the same work," she said in an interview a day prior to her honor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's unacceptable and it must change and we talk about it and we must be active in trying to create gender equity in terms of pay."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The fact is that most film directors are men, white men. Most major roles are male roles and (it's) the reason that I'm excited about this award," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Women have to become part of the very heart of movie making."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fonda, who is currently starring in Netflix series "Grace and Frankie" opposite Lily Tomlin, is also featured in the "Youth," which is in competition at the festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the Oscar winner - who dazzled on the red carpet at the premiere of Gus Van Sant's "The Sea of Trees" on Saturday night - feels there is too much of it in Hollywood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"That's another thing that's missing, is older women in the media," she said.</td></tr>
