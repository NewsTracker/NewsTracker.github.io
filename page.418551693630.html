<tr><td>60</td><td>They are considering tapping a fund, the EFSM, which is backed by all 28 countries in the EU.</td></tr>

<tr><td>62</td><td>EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis says that dipping into the EFSM "is not an easy option" but says there are no other obvious options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Once the full bailout package is operational, the initial loan could be repaid with money from the new program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Domvrovskis adds that the Commission is looking for guarantees to protect non-euro nations on such a loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>An independent United Nations expert on foreign debt says Greece's creditors may break international law if the austerity measures they demand lead to undue hardship.</td></tr>

<tr><td>67</td><td>He says in a statement Wednesday that European institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the Greek government must ensure that any bailout deal safeguards the right to health care, food and social security.</td></tr>
