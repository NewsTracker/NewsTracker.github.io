<h3>Strength in depth can help Celtic's Cup ambitions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Hoops face United at Tannadice just four days after slipping to a 1-0 defeat to St Johnstone - their first domestic defeat of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ronny Deila's side will have to do without Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong, who have made a sensational start to their Celtic careers since joining from Dundee United on transfer deadline day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The pair are cup-tied against their former employees, but Celtic captain Brown says the squad is strong enough to cope without them as the Glasgow giants continue their quest for a domestic treble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have a big enough squad and we have people in the squad who would probably get a game for most Scottish Premiership teams, so it shows we've got a good squad and they will be wanting their chance to get a game," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's going to be hard. We have played more games than anyone in the Scottish Premiership but we have a bigger squad than anyone else and we will use it wisely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Every game is important for us. It was the exact same last season and we were disappointed to go out the cups so early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It was a learning curve on Wednesday night, and it shows it's not all easy street for us, that we are going to win every game from now until the end of the season."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Despite the weakened state of traditional rivals Rangers, currently languishing in the second tier, the Hoops have struggled in cup competitions in the past three seasons, winning just one of the previous six domestic cup trophies up for grabs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Celtic made early exits in both cup competitions to Morton and Aberdeen last season and Brown says his side are determined to make amends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We want to win every game. Wednesday was a slight hiccup and we were lucky enough it was in the league," Brown said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It's about your character and how you bounce back. We are strong enough in that dressing room to bounce back from anything."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>United have been handed a boost ahead of the Celtic tie with the news that forward Nadir Ciftci is available to face the Scottish champions after he won his appeal against a two-match suspension following his clash with Inverness defender Gary Warren last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>United manager Jackie McNamara, whose side are without a win in their previous four matches, says his players are looking forward to the match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's a great chance to bounce back. A lot has been made because we've lost a couple of games," McNamara said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"There's no better opportunity than a quarter final at home to Celtic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Celtic are waiting on news of defender Adam Matthews, who twisted his ankle in the midweek defeat to St Johnstone, while striker John Guidetti, Kris Commons and Emilio Izaguirre all face late fitness tests.</td></tr>

<h3>Top US general optimistic about outcome of Tikrit battle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iranian-backed Shiite militias and Sunni tribes have joined Iraq's military in a major operation to retake Tikrit from the Islamic State group, while the U.S. led coalition has remained on the sidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) - The top U.S. general predicts the one-two punch of Iranian-backed militias and Iraqi government troops will prevail over Islamic State fighters in the unfolding battle for Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But U.S. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the expected successful push in Tikrit, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Baghdad, Iraq's capital, would not be possible without U.S. airstrikes that have tied down IS elsewhere in the north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dempsey was asked by reporters traveling with him overnight Friday from Washington to Bahrain whether he believes IS will be pushed out of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dempsey said about 23,000 Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen and Iraqi soldiers are involved in the offensive, compared with "hundreds" of IS fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The offensive is not what the Americans would consider textbook military tactics, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I wouldn't describe it as a sophisticated military maneuver," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>During his trip, Dempsey planned to meet with officials in Bahrain, and hold talks with government leaders and U.S. commanders in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He also planned to visit a French aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, sent to the Persian Gulf as part of the military operations in Iraq with the U.S.-led coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dempsey's visit, which began Saturday, comes at an intriguing stage of the war to force IS from Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Its fighters swept across much of northern and western Iraq last summer and now control numerous cities, including Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The U.S. and its allies have launched hundreds of airstrikes at IS targets since August, and those attacks are credited with halting the group's territorial advances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But in the Tikrit offensive, which began Monday, the U.S. is on the sidelines, watching as Iran asserts influence by providing training, weapons and leadership for Iraqi Shiite militias leading the charge on Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dempsey said he sees no evidence that the Iranian military is fighting on the ground in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Iranians have improved the Iraqi militias' fighting capabilities, but their role has raised worries among America's coalition allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Among them are Gulf Arab nations that despise Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described the push on Tikrit as "an Iraqi-designed and an Iraqi-controlled advance," while he acknowledged the role of militias that are getting "direction" from Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>If Iran "kills a bunch" of IS fighters and "it serves the interests of Iraq and the rest of us," Kerry said at a news conference Saturday in Paris, "that might wind up helping. But it doesn't mean that we accept in any way their behavior" in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and elsewhere in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Dempsey said that while Iran is getting credit for enabling the Tikrit offensive, the full story of how it was made possible has not been told.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"If it weren't for the (U.S.-led coalition) air campaign over time depleting the ISIL forces in Beiji ... then the current campaign (in Tikrit) as currently constructed would not be militarily feasible," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>IS had surged into Beiji, just north of Tikrit, in hopes of controlling a key oil refinery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But the militants have been halted and tied down by U.S. airstrikes, Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That little-noted IS setback has divided and weakened its forces, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The important thing about this operation in Tikrit is less about how the military aspect of it goes and more about what follows," Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The mostly Sunni population of Tikrit must be allowed to return to their homes, and the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad must step in with reconstruction and humanitarian aid, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The critical task for Iraq's leaders, Dempsey said, is to balance the Iranian role in empowering Shiite militias with Iraq's partnership with the U.S. and other coalition members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"The only one that can balance that is the prime minister of Iraq," Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"So I want to get his views on how he is seeking to balance that concern."</td></tr>
