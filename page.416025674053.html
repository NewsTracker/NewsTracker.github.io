<h3>Al-Shabaab camps bombed in retaliation by Kenyan air force</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The KDF said it bombed al-Shabaab camps in Somalia in retaliation for the attack.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>Gunmen from the al-Qaeda-aligned group killed 148 people on Thursday when they stormed the Garissa University College campus, some 200 kilometres from the Somali border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jets pounded the camps in Gondodowe and Ismail, both in the Gedo region bordering Kenya, the military source said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cloud cover made it difficult to establish how much damage the bombings caused or estimate the death toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We targeted the two areas because according to information we have, those (al-Shabaab) fellows are coming from there to attack Kenya," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Kenya Defence Force soldier runs for cover near the perimeter wall during the al-Shabaab attack on a school campus in Garissa last week.</td></tr>
