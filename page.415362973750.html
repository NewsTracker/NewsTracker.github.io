<h3>Ferguson city manager out after Justice Department report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- The Ferguson City Council on Tuesday evening unanimously approved a resolution to remove City Manager John Shaw following a scathing Justice Department report that already has led to a Missouri appeals court judge being tapped to overhaul the local court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The City Council in the St. Louis suburb, beleaguered by unrest since a white police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown last summer, held its first public meeting since the U.S. Department of Justice last week accused its police force and municipal court system of racial bias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A news release handed out at the meeting said the Council had reached a "mutual separation agreement" with Shaw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The statement also said a nationwide search for Shaw's replacement would begin immediately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Justice Department investigation already has resulted in a shake-up: Racist emails included in the report led to the firing of the city clerk and resignation of two police officers last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And on Monday, Municipal Judge Ronald J. Brockmeyer resigned and was immediately replaced by the Missouri Supreme Court with a state appellate judge empowered to overhaul court policies to "restore the integrity of the system."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Since Brown's death seven months ago, Mayor James Knowles has been the public face and voice of Ferguson's city government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But it's City Manager John Shaw who is its chief executive and holds the legal power to make personnel and policy changes in the police department - not Knowles, a part-time officeholder who earns less than $5,000 annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ferguson's city charter prohibits elected officials from "dictating the appointment or removal" of any city employees, including Police Chief Tom Jackson, whom Shaw hired in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Knowles and other City Council members are also forbidden from giving "orders, directions or instructions" to city workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They do, however, have the power to hire or fire the manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Shaw, 39, has been Ferguson's city manager for eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He had previously worked as city clerk and assistant to the city administrator in Shrewsbury, another town in St. Louis County.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Online biographies indicate that he grew up in north St. Louis County and lived in Ferguson before working for the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was honored in 2013 as a distinguished alumnus of a public policy administration program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, which is located near Ferguson, and was listed as an adviser for the university's student group for aspiring city managers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Shaw has not spoken publicly about the shooting, protests, grand jury inquiry or Justice Department investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He stood silently beside two City Council members at Knowles' Wednesday news conference responding to the Justice Department report and declined, through a city spokesman, a subsequent Associated Press interview request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Justice Department report repeatedly cited Shaw's role in encouraging his police force to aggressively ticket motorists as a means to generate revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In one instance, he responded to a Jackson email about a record-setting month for court revenue - nearly $180,000 in February 2011 alone - with the exclamation, "Wonderful!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And when Jackson told Shaw in January 2013 that municipal court revenue had exceeded $2 million the previous year, the city manager was similarly excited.</td></tr>
