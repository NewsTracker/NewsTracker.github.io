<h3>FIFA kicks off 2026 World Cup bidding; 2022 start left open</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA President Joseph Blatter, right, and Secretary General, Jerome Valck, left, attend a press conference following the FIFA Executive Committee meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, on Friday, March 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Among many topics, the Committee discussed the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ZURICH (AP) - Before even agreeing on a kickoff date for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA has begun the search for a host in 2026.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FIFA put expected bidders Canada, Mexico and the United States on notice Friday by setting May 2017 as a target to elect the host of a tournament which follows 32 years after the U.S. staged the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Thirty-two years is a long time," Jeffrey Webb, the president of the North American region, told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I believe it is CONCACAF's time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The timetable was approved by the FIFA executive committee a day after the same group decided the final in 2022 will be played on Dec. 18 - Qatar's national day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Though FIFA wants a 28-day tournament in the Gulf emirate's cooler months, a decision on opening day in 2022 was left undone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Still, with Qatar's controversial hosting finally being accepted as inevitable, FIFA's focus quickly turned to where its lucrative World Cup circus will go next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We think it should be played in June-July 2026," said FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke, referring to the furor at breaking World Cup tradition to play at the end of the year in Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Valcke also promised rigorous scrutiny of bidders after a slew of allegations implicated candidates in the 2018-2022 contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"These regulations will reach the level of transparency from the first minute of the process to the decision," FIFA's top administrator said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The process should begin several days after bid regulations are approved on May 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>FIFA's 209 member federations will choose the host at their 2017 congress in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>New election rules should rule out European countries, after Russia will host in 2018.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Asia also cannot have back-to-back tournaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Really, the only (other) countries with legitimate claims would be African countries," Webb told the AP in a telephone interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The world knows that the U.S. can host in one year's time," said the FIFA vice president, who is from the Cayman Islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"And we have seen the reports that (Canada and Mexico) are very much interested."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>CONCACAF has more interest in the special May 30 session of the FIFA executive committee, with new members and a president - likely Sepp Blatter starting a fifth term - elected the previous day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The meeting should agree on qualifying quotas for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups with each of FIFA's six continental bodies likely pitching for more slots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In Brazil last year, CONCACAF made a case for more guaranteed places as Costa Rica, Mexico and the United States advanced from their groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Asia's four teams failed to win a match in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The World Cup's global popularity and commercial power was made clear Friday when FIFA published its annual financial report, and summarized a four-year cycle of deals tied to the 2014 tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>FIFA revenue topped $2 billion last year, with $337 million in total profits from 2011-14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In 2014, FIFA added $91 million to its reserves, which now stand at $1.523 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The healthy picture let FIFA extend a working agreement with the 214-member European Club Association, which was a fierce critic of the switched playing dates in Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Clubs worldwide will share $209 million for releasing players to the 2018 World Cup, and the same again in 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They received only $70 million from 2014 revenues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Underlining the Gulf's growing influence, FIFA also sent more tournaments to the region on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The United Arab Emirates was chosen to host the Club World Cup, usually held in December, in 2017 and 2018.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The UAE previously hosted in 2009 and 2010.</td></tr>
