<h3>You Can Now Serve Divorce Papers on Facebook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Matthew Cooper ruled last week that a Brooklyn nurse is "granted permission to serve defendant with the divorce summons using a private message through Facebook."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ellanora Baidoo, 26, married Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku in a civil ceremony in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Things fell apart after he refused to have a traditional Ghanian wedding with both of their families afterwards, according to the New York Daily News, which was the first to report the story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Blood-Dzraku has been elusive ever since; he left his apartment without a forwarding address, has no DMV record, and has no fixed place of employment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He has, however, kept in touch from time to time with his wife on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"[The] transmittal shall be repeated by plaintiff's attorney to defendant once a week for three consecutive weeks or until acknowledged by the defendant," the ruling states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Additionally, after the initial transmittal, plaintiff and her attorney are to call and text message defendant to inform him that the summons for divorce has been sent to him via Facebook."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Baidoo might not be able to change her relationship status to single just yet, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As her lawyer told the NYDN, "So far, [Blood-Dzraku] hasn't responded."</td></tr>
