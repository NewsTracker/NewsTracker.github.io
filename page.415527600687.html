<h3>Wales call up Rob Evans and Aaron Jarvis for injured Gethin Jenkins and Samson Lee ahead of RBS 6 Nations clash with Italy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Gatland has confirmed that Lee, who was carried off just 14 minutes into the Ireland game, suffered a full rupture of his Achilles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ospreys prop Aaron Jarvis will replace him for next Saturday's Six Nations appointment with Italy in Rome, with loosehead Rob Evans taking over from Gethin Jenkins, who has a hamstring problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gatland said: 'We were hoping he (Lee) was going to have surgery on Monday, but there was too much swelling, and it has been put back a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'He is a 50-50 chance for the World Cup, but we are confident he has enough time to get back and be available for the World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Evans and Jarvis will line up against Italy, while there are call-ups on the bench for hooker Ken Owens, props Rhys Gill and Scott Andrews and scrum-half Gareth Davies, with Mike Phillips missing out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Owens features among the substitutes instead of Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard, who had been following return-to-play protocols after taking a blow to his head during the Ireland game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Saracens forward Gill, meanwhile, gains a match-day place after only joining the squad for training on Monday, while Davies - a livewire operator and consistent try-scorer for the Scarlets - gets his chance instead of the hugely-experienced Phillips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In terms of the starting line-up, it will be Evans' full Wales debut after he went on as a replacement for Jenkins at half-time last Saturday, with Jarvis continuing instead of Lee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Wales will head to the Stadio Olimpico lying third in the Six Nations table behind England and Ireland on points difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A comprehensive victory over Italy, though, would turn up the heat on their title rivals, with Ireland tackling Scotland at Murrayfield next Saturday, followed by England hosting France at Twickenham.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Gatland added: 'It was great to get the result we wanted in front of our home supporters last weekend and to give us a chance going into the last round of action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'Obviously, it's disappointing for Gethin and Samson, but Rob and Aaron stepped up well last weekend and we expect the same on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'The challenge to us is to go to Italy and win, and try to win by a significant margin, but we know that's an extremely tough ask and the first job will be to simply get the result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wales have won five of their previous seven Six Nations visits to Rome, highlighted by a 38-8 victory in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And they are going to need something similar - if not better - if they are to realistically have a chance of securing their third Six Nations title in four years.</td></tr>

<h3>Penn State frat suspended for year over nude Facebook pics</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The fraternity has been suspended as police investigate allegations that members used a private, invitation-only Facebook page to post photos of nude and partly nude women in sexual and other embarrassing positions, some apparently asleep or passed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>HARRISBURG, Pa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) - A Penn State University fraternity was suspended for a year Tuesday after police began investigating allegations that members used a private, invitation-only Facebook page to post photos of nude and partly nude women, some apparently asleep or passed out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A former member of Kappa Delta Rho at the university's flagship campus in State College tipped police off to the page, telling them in January that it had been used by members to share photos of "unsuspecting victims, drug sales and hazing," according to a copy of a police warrant obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The ex-member also provided authorities with printouts from the page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fraternity's national executive director, Joe Rosenberg, told the Penn State chapter in a letter on Tuesday that is banned from most activities for the near future and must reorganize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said the suspension was "for the most serious misconduct, most serious disregard of fraternity rules, policies and property by the chapter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chapter officials, who can appeal the decision, did not respond to messages seeking comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Penn State administrator called the allegations a violation of the standards and values required for recognized student organizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent with the university community's values and expectations," Damon Sims, Penn State's vice president for student affairs, said in a news release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sims vowed that the university would find those responsible and hold them accountable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Police said anyone who posted the photos could face arrest on charges that include invasion of privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>An investigation of the informant's computer "yielded information on two victims whose images would rise to the level of criminal action," State College police Lt. Keith Robb said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Facebook was contacted to disable the site and to obtain more information for the investigation, Robb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some of the postings involved nude women in "sexual or embarrassing positions," the warrant reads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It appears from the photos provided that the individuals in the photos are not aware that the photos had been taken."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Penn State's Interfraternity Council said Kappa Delta Rho will be summoned to the council for full review of its conduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>According to the ex-frat member who went to police, a second page dubbed "2.0" was started in about April 2014 after a woman depicted on the first Facebook page, called "Covert Business Transactions," complained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The informant said the woman was visiting the fraternity when a member accidentally left his Facebook page logged in, and she noticed a photograph of her topless that was posted to the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The investigation was first reported by television station WJAC in Johnstown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>According to the warrant, the fraternity's page had 144 active members that included both students and alumni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The photographs accompanying the warrant included images of fully nude and partly clothed women and a scene of a man appearing to grope a woman, her pants partly pulled down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Police said the informant who visited the police station provided brief explanations about individual photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>One, he said, showed a woman vomiting in a member's room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Another, he said, showed "the type of stuff that happens at KDR."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Two other images showed strippers hired by the fraternity for a party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Some of the posts included with the warrant were images of cellphone text exchanges, including one from a woman apparently concerned about a casual sexual encounter the night before and whether birth control was used.</td></tr>
