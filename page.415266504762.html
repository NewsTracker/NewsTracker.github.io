<h3>3 reasons Apple's watch will _ or won't _ change the game</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The company's iPod, iTunes, iPhone and iPad have shaken up music, phone and computer markets worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Is the Apple Watch going to be able to do the same?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The stakes are big for Apple CEO Tim Cook: the watch is the first brand-new Apple product to be launched without legendary co-founder Steve Jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the market is awash in smartwatches that have gained little traction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Here are three reasons the Apple Watch will finally move the needle in the smartwatch industry - and three reasons it might not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>MORE FEATURES THAN RIVALS: Along with email, texts and phone calls, Apple says its watch will present news, health readings and other notifications in creative ways that can be read at a glance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It will have a heart rate monitor and accelerometer, and an internal motor that can signal the wearer with a subtle "tap" on the wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And Siri and Apple Pay will be built in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple is working with outside companies to create more apps; Cook has talked about using the watch as an electronic "key" for hotel doors or even cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A POWERFUL BRAND: The world's biggest tech company has a reputation for quality and a direct conduit to customers - it operates more than 400 retail stores around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And it has deep pockets to spend on advertising - it is showcasing the watch this month with a sleek, 12-page insert in Vogue and other fashion magazines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>APPLE'S TRACK RECORD: This wouldn't be the first Apple product that revolutionized a market where rivals had struggled to break through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Other companies made digital music players before the iPod, smartphones before the iPhone and even tablets before the iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Most of those products failed to catch on until Apple made devices so appealing they set new standards and created new demand, said Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>WHAT'S THE NEED?: Most smartwatches - including Apple's - only work with a smartphone nearby, so you can't swap one expensive gadget for the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"What we've seen is that it's not obvious why people would want a smartwatch," says Gownder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A recent Forrester survey found some respondents didn't see a reason to buy one because they already owned a less-expensive fitness band or a full-featured smartphone (although it also found Apple fans ready to buy the new watch).</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>CONSUMERS NOT EXCITED: You can already buy smartwatches made by giant tech companies like Samsung, Sony or LG, or from a tech startup like Pebble, that track your heart rate, show you email and deliver other online services to your wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>None of them have really caught on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Only about 5 million smartwatches were sold worldwide last year, according to market researchers at Strategy Analytics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>By comparison, Apple sold 74.6 million iPhones in just the last quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>PRICE AND OBSOLESCENCE: Many of today's smartwatches sell for $200 or less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Apple plans to sell three models, starting at $349, but Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster predicts the average buyer will pay $550 for a watch and extra, interchangeable bands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Apple's high-fashion "Edition" model, made with 18-karat gold, is expected to cost thousands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>While affluent consumers might pay that for a watch they can wear for years, or even hand down to their children, it's a lot of money for something that could become outdated if Apple releases a new model every year or so - as it does with smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Cook will make his case for the Apple Watch at a press event Monday, where he's expected to show off more features and apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Expectations are high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But even the iPhone didn't become a mainstream blockbuster in its first year, notes Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Of the Apple Watch, he says, "people need to understand more about what this product is, and what it does, and I think that will evolve over time."</td></tr>

<h3>Here are some of the countries where having a uterus can be dangerous</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As this map published by the Center for Reproductive Rights shows, many countries still severely restrict, or even totally ban, a woman's right to access safe and legal abortion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Source: Center for Reproductive Rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Laws that limit or prevent legal abortions contribute to the deaths of tens of thousands of women every year, mostly, but not exclusively, in the developing world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The World Health Organization has described the phenomenon as a "preventable pandemic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And while legalization of abortion would go a long way toward reducing that death toll, it won't necessarily bring it down to zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Legalization of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women's health; in some countries, such as India, where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers," the WHO said, highlighting poverty, weak health care systems and social attitudes toward women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The underlying causes of morbidity and mortality from unsafe abortion today are not blood loss and infection but, rather, apathy and disdain toward women."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Here are eight countries where women face some of the hardest fights for their reproductive rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Abortion is illegal under all circumstances in El Salvador - even if the life of the woman is at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>So draconian are the country's pro-life laws that even women who lose their unborn babies during medical emergencies can be jailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Such is the case for 17 women, known as "Las 17," who are serving jail sentences of up to 40 years for allegedly murdering their fetuses after suffering miscarriages, stillbirths or other life threatening complications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Carmen Guadalupe Vasquez, one of Las 17, was granted an unprecedented pardon last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 2014 Malta recognized same-sex partnerships and allowed gay couples to adopt children, a relatively progressive policy on family planning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But abortion?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>No way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That is still banned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Malta is the only European country where abortion is 100 percent illegal - even if the life of the woman is at risk or the unwanted pregnancy is the result of rape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Much has been written about China's decades-old one child policy, and moves in recent years to ease restrictions on the number of children couples can have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Couples who have no siblings of their own are now allowed to apply to have a second child, but the fact remains that the government still controls - and restricts - the size of families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Break those rules and punishments can range from heavy fines to forced sterilizations and abortions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The death in 2012 of Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar, who died after being denied an abortion under the country's strict pro-life laws, sparked outrage across Ireland and forced the government to relax restrictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which came into force in 2014, doctors are now allowed to perform an abortion if the life of the mother is at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But most reasons for seeking an abortion remain illegal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>That means Irish women who have been raped or who are carrying a non-viable pregnancy still go abroad or resort to dangerous methods (like drinking bleach) to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Since the Supreme Court handed down its landmark Roe vs Wade decision in 1973, women in America have had the legal right to seek an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But, thanks to the efforts of politically influential pro-life campaigners, that right is getting harder to exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"At least half" of US states have imposed "excessive and unnecessary regulations on abortion clinics," according to the Guttmacher Institute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The result has been a reduction in the number of medical centers offering abortion services, with an astounding 89 percent of counties having no abortion clinic at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>And it gets worse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Earlier this year the House of Representatives passed a law that bans federal funding of abortions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Thousands of girls and women are raped in Honduras every year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But rape survivors who become pregnant as a result of their sexual assault are not allowed to get a legal abortion or even take a morning-after pill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That's because authorities in the strongly Roman Catholic country believe the rights of an unborn child should be "protected by law at all costs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That means any method to terminate a pregnancy is considered illegal and carries a multi-year jail sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The impoverished Caribbean country, which was flattened by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake in 2010, also bans the termination of a pregnancy under any circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Unsafe abortion is the "leading cause" of maternal death in Kenya, despite a relaxation of laws in 2010 that gave doctors more wiggle room to determine if a pregnancy should be terminated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>A study conducted by Kenya's Ministry of Health in 2012 shows 266 women die per every 100,000 unsafe abortions, which the ministry said was "disproportionately high" for the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Lack of access to safe abortion facilities and the high rate of unplanned pregnancies were cited for the deaths.</td></tr>
