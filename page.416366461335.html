<h3>Death of Baltimore man a week after arrest raises questions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - A black man died in a Baltimore hospital on Sunday, a week after he was arrested and dragged into a police van by white patrol officers, authorities said on Sunday, raising questions about how he sustained his injuries and prompting an investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Freddie Gray, 27, died at the Shock Trauma Center, a part of the University of Maryland Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Karen Lancaster said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He was brought to the hospital on April 12 after his arrest on suspicions of criminal activity, according to police, who have not revealed any specific allegations against him.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Local media, citing a family spokesman, have reported that he had spinal injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Representatives of the hospital and the Baltimore police were not immediately available for further comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gray's death follows a series of killings of unarmed black men by white police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The deadly encounters, including incidents in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City, have raised a national outcry over the treatment of minorities by law enforcement.</td></tr>
