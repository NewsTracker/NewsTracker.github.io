<h3>Galapagos Island Volcano Erupts First Time in 33 Years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A volcano atop one of the Galapagos Islands has erupted for the first time in 33 years, threatening a fragile ecosystem that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ecuador's Galapagos National Park administration said the mile-high (1.7 kilometer-high) Wolf volcano began spewing fire, smoke and lava before dawn Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The volcano lies on the northern tip of Isabela Island, the archipelago's largest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It's far from the only population center, Puerto Villamil, 70 miles (115 kilometers) to the south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities said no tourist activity was affected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Authorities said lava flowing in the southwest direction for now poses no risk to the world's only population of pink iguanas, which live on the island's northwest tip.</td></tr>
