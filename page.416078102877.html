<h3>Russia's Putin hints at ending embargo on food imports from Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin has hinted that Moscow could lift its embargo on food imports from Greece, which has been hurt by the ban and is embroiled in crucial talks with its European creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Putin made televised remarks on Wednesday at a meeting with visiting Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece, dependent on massive international bailouts since 2010, will run out of funds within weeks unless it reaches a deal with its creditors for a new installment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tsipras' visit has been regarded as either an attempt to use his relationship with Russia as a potential bargaining chip or simply an effort to enhance ties with a traditional ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In retaliation against Western sanctions, Russia last year banned selected food imports from the European Union including Greece.</td></tr>
