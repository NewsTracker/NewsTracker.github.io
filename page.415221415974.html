<h3>Embattled Clinton Urges Release Of Her Emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton has urged the State Department to release the emails she wrote from a private email account while serving as Secretary of State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the first time Mrs Clinton had weighed in over a mounting controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a tweet late on Wednesday, she said: "I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The stance was aimed at cooling a political firestorm over allegations that she inappropriately used her personal email for work during her stint at the State Department from 2009 to 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The row has suddenly put Mrs Clinton into trouble just as she is planning to launch a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It has raised questions about transparency and security of her communications, and Republicans were quick to criticise her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The State Department said it would review the emails provided by Clinton "using a normal process that guides such releases".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We will undertake this review as quickly as possible. Given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete," spokeswoman Marie Harf said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A State Department official told Reuters the review "is likely to take several months", giving Mrs Clinton's political foes plenty of time to comment on the controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mrs Clinton's tweeted statement came hours after a congressional committee investigating the September 2012 attack on a US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, issued subpoenas for her emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mrs Clinton's team said this week she acted no differently from her predecessors at the State Department who also used private email addresses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Last year, she provided the State Department 55,000 pages of emails after the department asked her and other former secretaries for records that should be preserved.</td></tr>

<h3>World Health Organization to test Ebola vaccine in Guinea, aims to find and stop linked cases</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The West African nations of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea have been hardest hit in the yearlong Ebola outbreak, which has left more than 9,800 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a statement Thursday, the U.N. health agency said the vaccine study will focus on Basse Guinee, the region that has Guinea's most Ebola cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The health agency's vaccination strategy in Guinea aims to create a buffer zone around an Ebola case to prevent its further spread - an approach used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officials will vaccinate people who have already been exposed to Ebola cases and are at risk of developing the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The vaccine being tested - VSV-EBOV - was developed by Canada and is now licensed to Merck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A second vaccine - one developed by U.S. National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline - will be tested in a separate study as supplies become available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Guinea trial is being conducted with other health partners including Doctors Without Borders, Epicentre, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Guinean government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"If a vaccine is found effective, it will be the first preventive tool against Ebola in history," WHO chief Dr. Margaret Chan said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bertrand Draguez, medical director of Doctors Without Borders, applauded the move, which he called long overdue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"For more than a year, we have been racing around the clock to stop the epidemic from spreading further," he noted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Wednesday, WHO reported 132 new Ebola cases last week, an increase from the 99 cases reported the previous week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The agency said the spread of Ebola remains "widespread" in Sierra Leone and noted that cases have jumped both there and in Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>WHO said only about half of new Ebola patients in Guinea are connected to known cases, meaning that health officials are unable to track where the disease is spreading in the other half of cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>WHO also said unsafe traditional burials - a high-risk factor for Ebola transmission - continue to occur in both Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Officials also said the number of Ebola deaths taking place outside of hospitals still remains high in Guinea and Sierra Leone, "suggesting that the need for early isolation and treatment is not yet understood, accepted or acted upon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>WHO had previously set a goal of isolating all Ebola cases and ensuring all burials were safe by January 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Authorities in Liberia planned to discharge the country's last Ebola patient on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It will take 42 days of no new cases for Liberia to be declared Ebola-free by WHO standards.</td></tr>
