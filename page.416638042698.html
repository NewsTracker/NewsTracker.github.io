<h3>US STOCKS-Wall St falls on mixed economic data; Apple weighs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>April 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street was lower in afternoon trading on Thursday as Apple weighed on major indexes and investors digested a mixed batch of economic data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nine of the 10 major S&P sectors were down, with the technology index retreating 1.2 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Nasdaq biotech index dropped 2.2 percent, led by Celgene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple fell as much as 2.6 percent to $125.25 and was the biggest drag on the Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company limited the availability of the Apple Watch after a key component was found to be defective, according to the Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Investors were also digesting a mixed bag of economic data which came in a day after data showed that the U.S. economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits tumbled to a 15-year low last week, consumer spending rose less-than-expected in March as personal income stayed flat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James, said investors were operating in a period of high uncertainty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I think its very, very healthy to see some back and forth in the equity markets. Economic data is still going to be a bit mixed in the near term and that can be used as a crutch for the markets."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At 13:24 p.m. EDT (1724 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 102.53 points, or 0.57 percent, at 17,933, the S&P 500 was down 12.79 points, or 0.61 percent, at 2,094.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 51.74 points, or 1.03 percent, at 4,971.90.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Celgene fell 3.5 percent to $109.28 and was the biggest drag on the biotech index after the company blamed the dollar for its lower-than-expected quarterly revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The stock was the second biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Baidu declined 7.1 percent to $203.25 after China's dominant Internet search engine provider posted its slowest quarterly revenue growth rate in almost seven years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The tech sector is a very "risk-on" sector and is the sector most sensitive to perceived rate hikes, so you're seeing some reshuffling in portfolios," said Brian Fenske, head of sales trading at ITG in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Google, IBM and Intel were down by 1.2 to 1.8 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Yelp shares slumped as much as 24 percent to a near two-year low of $39.25 a day after the operator of consumer review website forecast second-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Colgate-Palmolive slipped 2.1 percent to $67.08 after cutting its full-year profit forecast for the second time, saying the impact of the dollar would worsen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Earnings expected after the close on Thursday include Dow component Visa, insurer AIG and LinkedIn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,188 to 781, for a 2.80-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,918 issues fell and 786 advanced for a 2.44-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.</td></tr>
