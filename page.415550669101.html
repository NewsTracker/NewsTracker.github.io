<h3>Police cars set afire at austerity protest in Germany</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ceremony went ahead as planned, with ECB President Mario Draghi saying the new building for the euro bloc's monetary authority was "a symbol of what Europe can achieve together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police said 350 people were detained as officers pursued what they said was a minority of violence-minded activists using the protest as cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bulk of demonstrators conducted themselves peacefully, marching in groups, drumming and singing ahead of a rally in the city's main square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some blocked bridges across the Main River or streets in an effort to hinder access to the ECB ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Protesters said they are targeting the central bank because of its role in supervising efforts to restrain spending and reduce debt in financially troubled countries such as Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blockupy activist Hannah Eberle said that "people remain determined" despite the heavy police presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The mood is good, we are in solidarity with each other," she said ahead of the rally: "The day is long, we are not yet finished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At the ECB ceremony, Tarek Al-Wazir, economy minister of the German Hesse region, called on the peaceful demonstrators to "distance yourselves from the violence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Wazir, a member of the Greens party, said that the protesters "have no answers ... but they have some of the right questions," conceding that "austerity can indeed be self-defeating."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said the ECB was the wrong target for this kind of protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Draghi has in fact urged more spending by governments that are in good financial shape such as Germany to help lift the economy and reduce unemployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That advice has been ignored by the German government, which has stressed the need to balance its budget and pressed others to restrain spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Police said several police cars were set on fire at a police station in the city center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Another police vehicle smoldered a block from the ECB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Private vehicles and garbage bins were also torched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some 10,000 people were expected on Frankfurt's main square, the Roemerberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Participants were to include trade unions and Germany's Left Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The ECB, along with the European Commission and International Monetary Fund, is part of the so-called "troika" that monitors compliance with the conditions of bailout loans for Greece and other financially troubled countries in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Those conditions include spending cuts and reducing deficits, moves that are aimed at reducing debt but have also been blamed for high unemployment and slow growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Anti-austerity activists received a political boost when Greece's left-wing Syriza party won elections there in January by campaigning against the bailout deal and its conditions, which they say has led to a "humanitarian crisis."</td></tr>

<h3>Iraq Sunni province key to taking Mosul from Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Khalid al-Obeidi's remarks reflected the challenges Iraqi forces, backed by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, face as they try to claw back territory captured by IS militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They also indicate the operation to take back Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, may come later than expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At the moment, Iranian-backed Iraqi soldiers and allied Shiite militias are fighting to retake Islamic State-held city of Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown - an offensive that is taking place without U.S. airstrikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Smoke rises after clashes between Iraqi security forces and allied Shiite militiamen and Islamic State group extremists in the Qadisiyya neighborhood in Tikrit, 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Baghdad, Iraq, Tuesday, March 17, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Al-Obeidi told reporters Wednesday that before Iraqi forces can undertake the battle for Mosul, they must "secure" Anbar so that it cannot serve as staging ground for militant counterattacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Anbar, west of Baghdad, was the first province to fall under Islamic State's control during the group's blitz last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The province shares a long border which Syria, which has enabled the militants to move fighters and weapons between the two countries virtually unpoliced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We must secure Anbar and we are now focused on securing Anbar," al-Obeidi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He singled out the town of Hit, in Anbar, saying it is an obvious place from where IS can strike back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tikrit is viewed by Iraqi forces as key to opening a strategic corridor that leads to Mosul from one direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>U.S. officials had said that there would likely be a spring offensive to reclaim Mosul, but Iraqi officials have backed away from setting a timeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Also Wednesday, a leading international rights group accused Iraq's Shiite militias fighting alongside government forces of carrying out the of "deliberate destruction of civilian property" after the town of Amirli, northeast of Baghdad, and the surrounding area was recaptured from IS last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Human Rights Watch, in a report focusing on the Shiite militias' role in freeing Amirli, cited evidence of militiamen looting the property of Sunni civilians who had fled the fighting, burning their homes and businesses, and destroying at least two villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Iraq clearly faces serious threats in its conflict with ISIS, but the abuses committed by forces fighting ISIS are so rampant and egregious that they are threatening Iraq long-term," said Joe Stork, the deputy Middle East and North Africa director at HRW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Iraqis are caught between the horrors ISIS commits and abusive behavior by militias, and ordinary Iraqis are paying the price," Stork added, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In Baghdad, the spokesman for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's office said the government has "zero tolerance for any human rights violations."</td></tr>
