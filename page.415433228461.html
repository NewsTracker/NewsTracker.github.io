<h3>Egypt Announces Plans to Build New Capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Egypt Economic Development Conference that opened Friday is the government's centerpiece for showing that the country is ready for business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has staked much of his legitimacy on fixing an economy deeply damaged by four years of turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Egypt's government announced Friday plans to build a new capital adjacent to Cairo, in a massive new project that in its first phase would cost $45 billion and take up to seven years to complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Housing Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced the plan at the opening of the 3-day international economic conference held in this resort city and attended by hundreds of business executives and world leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The aim, he said, is to alleviate congestion and overpopulation in Cairo over the next 40 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>By that time, Cairo - currently home to nearly 20 million - would have doubled in size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The first phase of the ambitious program, Madbouly said, is an expansion of the current outskirts of the capital to the east, adding an additional 105 kilometers (60 miles) of development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The area would be a new administrative center including government offices, diplomatic missions and housing as well as universities, a technology and innovation park, and 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) of roads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Madbouly did not say what the new administrative center would be named.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The military has already began constructing the road linking Cairo to the new planned administrative heart of the capital, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The ambitious plan is the latest mega project planned by the government, headed by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who elected in June last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The other mega project is the expansion of the Suez Canal and the creation of an industrial zone around it.</td></tr>

<h3>Wikipedia edits to police killings linked to NYPD HQ</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The news site Capital New York created a computer program to track edits to Wikipedia from Internet Protocol addresses registered to 1 Police Plaza, the NYPD headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They found hundreds of edits over the last decade from NYPD IPs, including numerous edits to entries about police killings and pages critical of police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>For example, hours after a grand jury decided not to indict cop Daniel Pantaleo for the choking death of Eric Garner in New York City, the page was edited to change "Garner raised both his arms in the air" to "Garner flailed his arms about as he spoke" and to say Garner was "considerably larger than any of the officers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Someone from an NYPD IP also submitted the "Sean Bell shooting incident" page to "Articles for deletion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bell was killed in 2006 when undercover NYPD offers fired 50 times at three unarmed men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The user wrote that "no one except Al Sharpton cares anymore. The police shoot people every day, and times with a lot more than 50 bullets. This incident is more news than notable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>These are just two of many examples of edits to pages that question NYPD conduct Captal New York found, including changes to the page for the department's controversial stop-and-frisk program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Capital said the NYPD wrote in an e-mail that "the matter is under internal review."</td></tr>
