<h3>Iraqi forces launch counter-attack against Islamic State in Anbar</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced the new Anbar offensive last week, but Islamic State (IS) then overran two districts on the northern outskirts of the provincial capital Ramadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A policeman in one of those districts, Albu Faraj, said security forces had recaptured around 40 percent of it on Monday, but were facing stiff resistance from the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Today, Anbar province, and specifically Ramadi, is subject to the most aggressive attack in more than a year," Anbar governor Suhaib al-Rawi told al-Hadath television channel late on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We need additional forces because the battle in Anbar is fierce and IS is using all different kinds of weapons."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Islamic State has reinforced its ranks with fighters from elsewhere in the province and planted bombs to hinder the advance, said Anbar provincial council member, Athal al-Fahdawi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The new offensive in Anbar was supposed to build on a victory in the city of Tikrit, which Iraqi forces, including Shi'ite paramilitaries, retook this month, but the militants have struck back elsewhere, including at the country's largest refinery in Baiji.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A provincial official said the militants were attacking Baiji to divert attention away from Anbar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Their key focus is not Baiji; the prime target is Anbar," said Khazaal Hammad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There is a big battle in Anbar, so IS is trying to distract them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Large parts of Anbar had slipped from the government's grasp even before Islamic State overran the northern city of Mosul last June and proclaimed a caliphate straddling the border between Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Security forces and Shi'ite paramilitaries have since regained some ground in Iraq, although core Sunni territories remain under Islamic State control, including Anbar and the northern province of Nineveh.</td></tr>
