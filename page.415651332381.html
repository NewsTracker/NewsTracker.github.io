<h3>European far-right politicians join Russian nationalists to back Putin, slam West on Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Putin's critics pointed to the irony of St. Petersburg, his hometown, welcoming neo-Nazis as Russia prepares to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The meeting drew about 40 protesters, who held signs denouncing fascism, and about eight of them were detained by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Among the more prominent Europeans at the gathering was Nick Griffin, the expelled former leader of the anti-immigrant British National Party, who accused the U.S. of aggravating the confrontation in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 people have been killed in fighting between government troops and Russia-backed separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The people running the U.S. and their puppets in the European Union are doing everything they can, whether deliberately or just by stupidity, to drag us into a terrible war," Griffin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He spoke out against the EU sanctions, as did Udo Voigt, a senior figure in Germany's neo-Nazi fringe National Democratic Party, who was among several members of the European Parliament who attended the St. Petersburg gathering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Griffin lost his seat in the EU body last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Roberto Fiore, leader of Italy's far-right party Forza Nuova, and members of the neo-Nazi Greek party Golden Dawn also were among the approximately 200 participants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Russian nationalists who participated included Alexei Zhuravlev, a member of Russia's parliament, and Cossacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Many Cossacks, descendants of the czarist-era horsemen who defended Russia's borders, have fought alongside the separatists in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
