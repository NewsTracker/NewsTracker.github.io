<h3>5 years after BP spill: What's changed in offshore drilling</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW ORLEANS (AP)?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As oil gushed from BP's ruptured well five years ago and public outrage built by the day, the Obama administration issued a six-month moratorium on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When the well was finally capped after nearly three months, political and industry pressure mounted on the White House to lift the ban, which it did about a month earlier than planned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Since then, oil and gas drilling Gulf has bounced back strongly and the number of deep-water drilling rigs has actually increased from 35 to about 48.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Drillers are pushing into even deeper water and greater depths below the sea floor to reach reservoirs considered riskier than the Macondo field, the source of the nation's worst offshore spill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Elsewhere, the Obama administration has pushed to open up offshore waters in Alaska and along the Atlantic coast to drilling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In January, the Interior Department unveiled a plan to open up drilling next year in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas on the Arctic coast of Alaska and off the coast between Maryland and Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Minerals Management Service, the agency overseeing drilling when the BP disaster occurred, is now defunct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was widely considered ineffective as a regulator and incapable of keeping up with changes in a high-tech industry, and the Obama administration broke it up into three entities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Now exploration and environmental planning are handled by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, drilling safety and inspections by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, and the collection of offshore royalties by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The number of offshore inspectors working the Gulf has increased to about 92, nearly twice as many as before the BP spill, according to the enforcement bureau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Federal inspectors do more rigorous inspections of blowout preventers, the devices that are meant to shut off an out-of-control well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Oil and gas companies are now required to complete extensive safety audits in which drillers must assess vulnerabilities and risks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Other problems in this area persist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Among other issues, the spill exposed the government's dependency on the industry for the expertise and equipment needed to cope with a broken underwater well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Regulators acknowledge they still depend on the industry and find it hard to keep up with innovations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Government agencies have long had trouble retaining engineers and inspectors, who can make much better salaries in the astronomically profitable energy sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Government Accountability Office noted in February that the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement struggles to keep enough highly trained personnel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Watchdogs say the regulatory changes have been slow and largely incremental.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After the BP blowout, regulators came under fire for approving drilling plans that included dead people and response plans for animals that don't exist in the Gulf, such as the walrus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Since then, exploration and drilling plans are vetted more carefully and must be approved by independent engineers.</td></tr>
