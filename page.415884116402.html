<h3>Germanwings Pilot Told Lufthansa of His Depression in 2009</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lufthansa was told about Andreas Lubitz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot who authorities believe purposely crashed a Germanwings jet into the Alps, had a documented history of depression, according to the New York Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After taking a brief leave from flight school, Lubitz informed Lufthansa of his history with the illness when attempting to rejoin the school in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The FAA allows pilots with depression to fly, as long as they're taking medicine and have been stable for at least six months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now's probably also a good time to point out that murder-suicides among depressed people are very rare, and pilot suicides even rarer.</td></tr>
