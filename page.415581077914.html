<h3>Egypt acquits Mubarak-era minister in last graft case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Habib al-Adly was cleared of illegally accumulating around 181 million Egyptian pounds ($25 million/23 million euros) and will be released, his lawyer Mohammed el-Gendy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The court also lifted an asset freeze on the former minister and members of his family, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Keeping him in jail for another hour would be illegal," Gendy said of the once-feared interior minister who ran Mubarak's security service with an iron grip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Adly has already served the full three-year sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Thursday's verdict is the latest in a series of acquittals for Mubarak-era officials, including the veteran leader himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An appeals court last month overturned a suspended five-year sentence slapped on Adly and ex-premier Ahmed Nazif over other corruption charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Adly was also cleared of murder charges in a separate retrial with Mubarak in November, for which he had been sentenced to life in prison by a lower court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Trials of Mubarak and his former officials have been overshadowed by those against Islamist former president Mohamed Morsi and other members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was branded a "terrorist group" in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Morsi was ousted earlier that year by then army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who was subsequently elected as his successor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since Morsi's ouster, the government has launched a brutal crackdown against his supporters that has left hundreds dead and thousands jailed after often speedy mass trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Morsi and leaders of his outlawed Muslim Brotherhood are facing several trials, punishable by death if found guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Youth leaders who spearheaded the 18-day revolt in 2011 that toppled Mubarak have also been jailed on charges of illegal protest over the past year.</td></tr>
