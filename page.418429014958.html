<h3>Nepal hospital, CNN differ on reported surgery after quake</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - A Nepal hospital said Friday that CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta incorrectly reported that he operated on an 8-year-old girl after the country's devastating earthquake in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A CNN spokeswoman said Gupta did perform surgery, and the news channel was trying to verify the patient's identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A top official at the Bir Hospital in Kathmandu, Dr. Ganesh Bahadur Gurung, said Friday that the girl, Salina Dahal, never had brain surgery and has recovered from minor head injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gupta, a practicing brain surgeon, reported days after the April 25 earthquake that he operated on Dahal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gurung said Gupta did observe the surgery of another 14-year-old girl, but it was unclear whether he actually assisted Nepali doctors because of the chaotic situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gupta did perform surgery at the hospital, CNN spokeswoman Neel Khairzada said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She said apparently different people at the hospital had given conflicting information to two CNN representatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>CNN provided smartphone-shot video of the operation that it said was taken at the hospital by CNN producer Tim Hume.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The video clips show Gupta in surgical scrubs and, at one point, using a hand-operated drill on a patient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Global Press Journal first reported this week that according to the girl's family and doctors, Dahal was never operated on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Instead, it reported Gupta operated on a 14-year-old girl, Sandhya Chalise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gurung said Gupta was allowed inside the hospital by a Nepali surgeon because Gupta said he wanted to observe and was also a surgeon himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Dahal and her family said she was in the hospital for eight days with minor injuries and a broken wrist but did not have any surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She showed minor scars on her head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Her grandfather - 61-year-old Ram Bahadur - said her wounds needed only stitches after being injured by falling debris on April 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She was taken to two different hospitals before ending up at Bir hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said she was visited by many doctors, including foreign ones, but was not sure if one was Gupta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dahal's family does not own a television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On CNN's "New Day" on Friday, Gupta addressed the issue of how the names of two patients could have been confused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"When you think about reporting these types of stories, it is a chaotic situation," he said, adding that the hospital's lobby turned into a "massive triage area."</td></tr>
