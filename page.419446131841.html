<h3>At busy crossing, pedestrians need passports to enter Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2015, photo, a man headed into Mexico stops at a fountain as fellow travelers approach the entrance to the Mexico border crossing in San Ysidro, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Starting late Wednesday, Aug. 19, pedestrians going to Tijuana from San Diego at the San Ysidro crossing must choose between a line for Mexicans who get waved through, and a line for foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Foreigners must show a passport, fill out a form and - if staying more than a week - pay for a six-month permit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>SAN DIEGO (AP) - Walking into Mexico at the nation's busiest border crossing with the United States is no longer an uninterrupted stroll for foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Starting late Wednesday, pedestrians going to Tijuana from San Diego at the San Ysidro crossing must choose between a line for Mexicans who get waved through, and a line for foreigners who must show a passport, fill out a form and - if staying more than a week - pay 322 pesos, or roughly $20, for a six-month permit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>About a dozen foreigners stood in line Wednesday night, directed by English-speaking agents to six inspection booths where they got passports stamped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It took about 10 minutes from start to finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Travelers have long followed similar protocol at Mexican airports, but the new border procedure marks a big change at land crossings that weren't designed to question everyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Pedestrians and motorists have generally entered Mexico unencumbered along the 1,954-mile border with the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is about putting our house in order," said Rodulfo Figueroa, Mexico's top immigration official in Baja California state, which includes Tijuana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The changes, which have been in the works for years, come as Donald Trump has surged to the top of the Republican field in the U.S. presidential race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He has insisted that Mexico sends criminals to the U.S. and pledges to build a border wall at Mexico's expense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For Mexico, it is a step toward closing an escape route for American criminals who disappear in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Border inspectors will tap into international criminal databases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Motorists will see no change, and if lines get too long, officials will also wave pedestrians through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>More than 120 Americans expelled from Mexico this year while living in Baja California had arrest warrants in the U.S., according to Figueroa, delegate of the National Migration Institute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some ordered to leave last year were on the FBI's most-wanted list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But authorities say benefits extend beyond stopping unwanted visitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A recent hurricane stranded twice as many Americans in Cabo San Lucas than U.S. authorities thought were there, Figueroa said, and registering as a foreigner would have made it easier to identify those who needed help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Figueroa said Mexico can initially process about 1,000 foreigners daily, up from about 50 currently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"If the line becomes clogged up, we will just let everybody through," Figueroa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"If we can't check everybody, we won't."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Figueroa said San Ysidro is believed to be the first U.S. land crossing to have a separate line for foreigners to show passports and that it will serve as a model for others as they are upgraded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Aurora Vega, a spokeswoman for the National Migration Institute, referred questions to other departments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Officials at the Foreign Relations Department and Mexican Embassy in Washington had no immediate comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>About 25,000 pedestrians (and 50,000 motorists) cross daily at San Ysidro to work, shop and play but it is unclear how many are foreigners in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>U.S. Customs and Border Protection says about one-third entering San Diego are U.S. citizens, one-third are U.S. legal residents and the rest are from other countries, largely Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>An unknown number have dual citizenship or residency in the U.S. and Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Both countries have long wrestled with logistical hurdles of stopping people going to Mexico by land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The U.S. occasionally stops motorists and pedestrians as they leave - mainly to check for guns and cash - but it doesn't have a system to record exits like at airports, seen by many as a significant shortcoming in border security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Previous efforts to question more foreigners entering Mexico met resistance in Tijuana, whose economy partly relies on Americans who visit restaurants, beaches, doctors and dentists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Lines to enter the United States at San Ysidro have exceeded four hours.</td></tr>
