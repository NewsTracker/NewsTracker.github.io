<h3>Clinton making first campaign trip to Iowa on Tuesday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton will tour a community college in Monticello on Tuesday and visit a produce distribution company in Norwalk on Wednesday, according to a schedule provided by her campaign Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She will also hold meetings with Democratic elected officials and activists in the leadoff caucus state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton announced Sunday that she'll seek the presidency for a second time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Her team has made clear that she wants to avoid big campaign events and instead focus on more personal interactions with voters in early voting states like Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton's 2008 campaign faltered in Iowa, where she placed third in the caucuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After that loss, she did not return to the state for seven years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last fall, Clinton came to Iowa for former Sen. Tom Harkin's final "Steak Fry" fundraiser and to campaign for Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>So far this year, Iowa Democrats have not seen Clinton - though several other hopefuls, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb have made visits to the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Many Iowa activists say she would be wise not to take the nomination for granted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Even those who like Clinton say they want a competition, not a coronation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Delpha Middleswart, 60, saw O'Malley speak last week at a fundraiser for a state representative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We all know Hillary. We need to hear from some other folks," said Middleswart, of Indianola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I think she's got good things. The Democrats need to have choices."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Clinton's announcement video featured several Iowans, including Julie Stauch, of West Des Moines, who talks about growing tomatoes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said she knew she was filming footage for Clinton, but didn't know she might be in the announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She said she wanted to participate because she's happy to do anything possible to help Clinton win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Stauch, who supported Clinton in 2008, said: "I think that she's planning to work hard and she'll do very well here. I think she'll do what it takes."</td></tr>
