<tr><td>53</td><td>Public record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>My initial proposal was to reinstate the Tony ten rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The tentative conclusion put forth in the NP RM suggested that the FCC could issue were Internet openness by applying it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Commercial reasonableness.</td></tr>
