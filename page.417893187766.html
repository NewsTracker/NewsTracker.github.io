<h3>Apple Music won?t have Taylor Swift?s ?1989?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When Apple's highly-anticipated streaming music service debuts later this month it will have a mega-marketing budget, an arsenal of 800 million customers to pitch - but it won't have Taylor Swift's best-selling "1989" album.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 25-year old songbird has told Apple CEO Tim Cook she won't license her latest album - which has sold more than 4.5 million copies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Swift has not licensed the CD to any streaming service - but Apple led fans to believe it would be the one service to grab hold of the 13-track CD released Oct. 27, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple, at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 8, unveiled the service, to debut June 30, and during its presentation showed a line-up of the top videos of the moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Swift's "Bad Blood," a track from "1989," was in the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>1 slot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The "Bad Blood" citing was widely interpreted as Apple having secured Swift's signature on a licensing deal.But no dice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In fact, Swift's label, Big Machine Records, has no plans to license "1989" on any streaming service, reps for the label told BuzzFeed, which first reported on Swift not being Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Swift last November famously pulled "1989" from streamer Spotify because it was including the CD on its free service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Swift felt the free service way undervalued the art form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple Music and other streamers, like Pandora, Spotify, Rdio and Tidal all have Swift's back catalog - but none have "1989."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>So while Apple has used it popularity - and its financial heft - to get whatever it wants in many contract talks, it couldn't push Swift around.</td></tr>
