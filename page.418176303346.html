<tr><td>3</td><td>Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Demchyshyn said after Tuesday's talks in Vienna that they couldn't clinch a deal on Russian supplies in the third quarter, according to Russian news agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Demchyshyn said a discount that Russia offered wasn't enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said Ukraine will buy gas from other nations starting July 1 until an agreement is reached with Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The current dispute comes at a moment when gas consumption is low, allowing Ukraine to bargain for better terms.</td></tr>
