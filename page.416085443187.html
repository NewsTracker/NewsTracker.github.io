<h3>Apple Watch stylish but not for everyone, reviewers say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"After using it, I had no question that the Apple Watch is the most advanced piece of wearable technology you can buy today," Bloomberg's Josh Topolsky wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The Apple Watch is cool, it's beautiful, it's powerful and it's easy to use. But it's not essential. Not yet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One issue is that it's relatively expensive: The Apple Watch, essentially a companion to the iPhone, is priced starting at $449 for the Watch Sport model up to breathtaking $22,000 for the 18-karat gold version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The devices are slated to start shipping April 24, with preorders starting April 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple has lined up several partners -- including ESPN, CNN, Facebook, Twitter, MLB.com, the New York Times and Fandango -- whose apps provide text-based alerts to wearers of the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But, according to New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo, while he generally liked the Apple Watch after a "steep" learning curve, the third-party apps available for the device are "mostly useless right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The Uber app didn't load for me, the Twitter app is confusing and the app for Starwood hotels mysteriously deleted itself and then hung up on loading when I reinstalled it," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As Manjoo concluded: "The first Apple Watch may not be for you -- but someday soon, it will change your world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Wall Street Journal's Geoffrey Fowler found the Apple Watch handy for tasks like dictating a text message and using Apple Pay at participating retailers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But, he said, "the Apple Watch isn't quite the gatekeeper to my digital life that I wanted. Take app alerts -- there's a fine line between being in the know and having your wrist jiggle all day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Setting up alerts for the smartwatch is a "tedious -- and unfortunately ongoing -- chore," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>USA Today's Ed Baig, who said he's eager to buy an Apple Watch, called it an "elegant combination of style and purpose."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Even so, he acknowledged drawbacks, including that it requires an iPhone 5 or later and is initially confusing to operate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"As with most first-time products, it isn't flawless or essential," Baig wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"But among smartwatches, Apple Watch is second to none. I want one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Reviewers found Apple Watch's estimated 18-hour battery life lived up to the promises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Still, that means users need to regularly recharge it, unlike a conventional wristwatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Fowler said the battery was often nearly drained by the end of the day, especially if used during exercise, while CNET's Scott Stein said recharge time was slow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Re/Code's Lauren Goode said that while the watch's battery life was not nearly as long-lasting as some other wearable devices, it was better than she had expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The fact that the Apple Watch relies on an iPhone being in the close proximity for most of its functions to work was also seen by some reviewers as a drawback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Paired with an iPhone, the watch allows users to check e-mail, listen to music and make phone calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Apps will also allow users to track their health - for instance by tracking heartbeats and the number of steps a person takes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"...If you can tolerate single-day battery life, half-baked apps and inevitable obsolescence, you can now wear the future on your wrist," Fowler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"For now, the Apple Watch is for pioneers," Fowler concluded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I won't pay the (US)$1,000 it would cost for the model I tested, only to see a significant improvement roll in before too long."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But CNET's Stein said Apple wants people to see the Apple Watch as "fine jewelry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Maybe that's a stretch, but in terms of craftsmanship, there isn't a more elegantly made piece of wearable tech."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Ultimately, it looks like the Apple Watch -- to be fair, like other smartwatches on the market -- is a cool-to-have gizmo, not a must-have breakthrough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>And for Apple, that indicates that it's not going to be The Next Big Thing the company is hoping for on the order of its category-busting iPhone and iPad successes.</td></tr>
