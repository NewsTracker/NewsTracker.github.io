<h3>Brewers' Smith ejected for having rosin, sunscreen on arm (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA (AP) -- Milwaukee Brewers relief pitcher Will Smith was ejected for having rosin and sunscreen on his right forearm in the seventh inning Thursday night of a 10-1 loss to the Atlanta Braves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Smith confirmed that he put the substance on his forearm before warming up in the bullpen on a brisk night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said that he regretted not wiping it off before entering the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It was chilly and kind of windy,'' Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''I had rosin and sunscreen on my arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I just forgot to wipe it off before I went out and pitched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I had to kind of get ready in a hurry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I just forgot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>With the bases loaded and one out and Atlanta leading 2-1, Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez emerged from the dugout and asked the umpires to check if Smith had pine tar on his arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''It was about as plain as it could be,'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''It's pretty blatant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After all four umpires gathered around Gonzalez, crew chief Jim Joyce walked to the mound, touched Smith's arm and tossed the reliever from the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Television cameras showed a shiny substance that was visible on Smith's forearm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''He offered his arm,'' Joyce told a pool reporter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''I touched it and immediately knew it was a foreign substance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Gonzalez argued that Smith was breaking the rules after the left-hander threw a pitch that bounced in front of the plate and hit pinch-hitter Pedro Ciriaco in the leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Smith had a count of no balls, one strike on the next batter, Jace Peterson, when Gonzalez called time and walked onto the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''I never went out there until he went to it (his arm),'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''You can look at the video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The first or second pitch to Peterson, he went to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Smith indicated that it's common for pitchers to use a substance in the bullpen to help them get a better grip on the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He insisted that he doesn't use the substance to gain a competitive advantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''You want to be able to feel the ball,'' Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''That's it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It's grip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It's not going to spin more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>You're not going to throw harder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman said he didn't blame Smith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''Every pitcher does it so they'll have a better grip so we won't get hit in the head,'' Freeman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Smith was visibly angry as he left the field, yelling at Gonzalez in the Braves' dugout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''That's not my problem if he's upset or not,'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Added Brewers manager Craig Counsell, ''It's very common.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It goes on on the other side, I guarantee you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>It's the rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Joyce said he was pleased with the way Smith handled the ejection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''I'm not going to make (the ejection) dramatic, because it is what it is and it's clear cut,'' Joyce said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>''Like I told Craig, 'I have no recourse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Smith said he won't be surprised if he gets suspended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''Who knows?</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>That's MLB's decision, not my call,'' Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''I was upset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>I'm a competitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Obviously you want to stay in the game and pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>It's a big situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>I want to be in there.</td></tr>
