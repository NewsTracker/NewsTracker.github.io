<h3>Kenya freezes key money transfers to Somalia after university terror attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kenya has frozen key money transfer companies vital for Somalia after the police chief issued a list of 85 people and businesses with suspected links to the Al-Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Top of the list issued in an official government gazette notice was alleged al-Shabab commander Mohamed Mohamud, said to be the mastermind behind the university massacre of almost 150 people last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the list also included money transfer companies that provide a crucial way for relatives to send remittances from abroad to war-torn Somalia, including Dahabshiil, one of the most important transfer companies across the wider Horn of Africa region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Their suspension in Kenya would have major impact on money transfers, with aid agencies warning in the past their suspension would hit some of poorest people the hardest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>With no formal banking system in the impoverished country, diaspora Somalis turn to money transfer services to send money back home to support their families, sending some $1.3 billion ($A1.69 billion) each year, dwarfing foreign aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta warned al-Shabab fighters his government will respond to their killing of 148 people in the university in Garissa in the "severest way" possible, with warplanes attacking Islamist bases in southern Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Kenyatta also warned that the masterminds behind the attack were inside Kenya, not Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We will not allow them to continue their lives as normal, the full force of the law will be brought to bear with even greater intensity that has been the case in previous years."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The notice, issued under Kenya's prevention of terrorism act and which gives the names listed 24 hours to demonstrate why they "should not be declared a specified entity," was signed by Kenya's police chief Joseph Boinett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There are huge flows of money both ways between the neighbouring nations, for trade and business, as well as in lifeline remittances to war-torn Somalia from relatives in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The day-long siege at Garissa University, situated near the border with Somalia, claimed 148 lives, including 142 students, three police officers and three soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It was Kenya's deadliest attack since the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Actions taken are consistent with the international law on financing terrorism.... We produced a list of persons and entities who may have been involved in facilitating terrorism activities," said top treasury official Kamau Thugge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Many of those listed are individuals, but also include transport companies and HAKI Africa, a Mombasa-based civil society group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The al-Shabab group has carried out a string of revenge attacks in neighbouring countries, notably Kenya and Uganda, in response to their participation in the AU force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On Saturday, al-Shabab warned of a "long, gruesome war" unless Kenya withdraws its troops from Somalia.</td></tr>
