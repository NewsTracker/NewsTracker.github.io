<h3>Prince Ali: Blatter playing politics with FIFA WCup slots</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali bin al-Hussein claims incumbent Sepp Blatter is playing politics with a key World Cup decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA's executive committee will give each continent its 2018 World Cup qualifying slots at a special session on May 30 - the day after the election where Blatter seeks a fifth presidential term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FIFA vice president Prince Ali told The Associated Press he believes the timing, steered by Blatter, links an issue based on football merit to election promises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It is emblematic of what is wrong with FIFA right now," the Jordanian prince told The Associated Press in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The timing of it is completely contradictory to (Blatter's) promise to not interfere in the election."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prince Ali plans to publish his campaign manifesto early next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said he would end FIFA's policy of paying World Cup bonuses to the 209 member federations months before they elect their president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The payments - worth $1.05 million each in 2014, doubling members' $1 million grant spread over four years - "oftentimes looks like" election inducements, said the prince.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There has to be a proper plan so that they can prepare and base their programs on what (money) they know they are guaranteed," Prince Ali said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"That way you also give dignity back to your national associations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Development help for poorer members will be central to his campaign, with pledges to create more artificial turf pitches and a database of coaches able to work on FIFA scholarships anywhere in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>During Prince Ali's 16-year leadership of the Jordan Football Association, the national team went further in World Cup qualifying than ever before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Jordan lost an intercontinental playoff against Uruguay for the final place in the 2014 tournament in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Friday, FIFA's ruling committee decided that an extra meeting in May will decide how to distribute 31 qualifying slots for the 2018 lineup in Russia, which enters automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Since Blatter was re-elected in June 2011, he has encouraged confederations to pitch for more guaranteed places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Those calls have been viewed as a challenge to the 13-team World Cup quota for UEFA, which is supporting all three of Blatter's election rivals: Prince Ali, Michael van Praag of the Netherlands and Luis Figo of Portugal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We should make decisions for the best interests of football and at the best time - and not have it based on politics," Prince Ali told the AP in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Though Blatter is strongly favored to extend his 17-year reign leading football's governing body, Prince Ali insisted the 79-year-old Swiss can be beaten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Yes, of course, I think if national associations follow their hearts," the prince said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"They are smart, they know what needs to be done. If they don't feel intimidated, if they feel that they have their own choice, I think that this definitely can be won."</td></tr>
