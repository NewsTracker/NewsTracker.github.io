<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Their repatriation brought the total number of Americans brought back from the West African nation to 18 since last Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"They were part of the same group that have been coming back slowly, said CDC spokeswoman Jennifer McQuiston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Neither of the two healthcare workers brought back Wednesday has tested positive for Ebola, but they are being monitored because they might have been exposed to a colleague who has contracted it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The infected healthworker is being treated at a biocontainment unit run by the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, McQuiston said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The CDC has not yet said how the initial patient was exposed to the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The others are being observed at several different locations in the United States, including Atlanta, Maryland and Nebraska.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Most of the healthworkers were employed by the aid group Partners in Health, though CDC has not divulged their names.</td></tr>

<h3>Geoff Parling recalled to England side for Six Nations clash with France</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Parling, 31, has been included for the title decider against France at the expense of Dave Attwood, who has started England's last eight Tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Exeter-bound second row, who will win his 23rd cap, missed the start of the championship with knee trouble but made a big impression as a replacement on his return against Scotland last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Attwood drops out of the squad with England bringing Harlequins' Nick Easter onto the bench as second row cover as Lancaster turns to experience for what could be a tense Twickenham evening with the title set to be decided on points difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Geoff did well off the bench against Scotland and now that he has got some games under his belt we feel it is the right time to start him and use his experience and quality in the starting line-up," said England coach Stuart Lancaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The same goes for Nick Easter, who has really impressed in camp and with his appearances off the bench in the second row. He is a quality ball carrier and great defender - something we feel we will need in the latter stages of the game."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The French have made two changes to their starting line-up, bringing in stand-off Jules Plisson and Vincent Debaty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Belgian-born prop will pack down against Leicester's Dan Cole who will win his 50th England cap in a front row which again includes hooker Dylan Hartley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He has held off the challenge of Tom Youngs - another strong contributor off the bench against the Scots - who is likely to have a big role to play when France deploy their massive bench in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It promised to be a dramatic conclusion to the championship and Lancaster is banking on the Twickenham factor making a difference to the outcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Finishing off the tournament at home is going to be a great occasion. The support against Scotland last week was fantastic and this week we really need the crowd to get behind the team and drive them forward this weekend in what will be an exciting finale to this year's championship," said Lancaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>England: Brown; Watson, Joseph, Burrell, Nowell; Ford, B Youngs, Marler, Hartley, Cole, Parling, Lawes, Haskell, Robshaw (capt), B Vunipola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Replacements: T Youngs, M Vunipola, Brookes, Easter, Wood, Wigglesworth, Cipriani, Twelvetrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>France: Spedding; Huget, Fickou, Mermoz, Nakaitaci; Plisson, Tillous-Borde; Debaty, Guirado, Mas, Flanquart, Maestri, Dusautoir (capt), Le Roux, Goujon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Replacements: Kayser, Slimani, Atonio, Taofifenua, Chouly, Kockott, Tales, Bastareaud.</td></tr>
