<h3>Los Angeles schools chief to seek halt to computers-for-all program</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cortines said the district could not afford the program, which aimed to provide iPads and computers to the district's 640,000 students, along with teachers and many administrators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We are committed to providing technology to our children -whether it be desktop computer labs, laptops or tablets - to help prepare them for the 21st century," Cortines said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"However, as we are reviewing our lessons learned, there must be a balanced approach to spending bond dollars to buy technology when there are so many brick and mortar and other critical facility needs that must be met."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Cortines made his remarks amid tense labor negotiations between the Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers union, United Teachers of Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earlier this week, both sides said they were deadlocked in negotiations over raises, class size and other issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For the third time in a long career, Cortines took the helm of the massive school district in the fall, after the resignation of John Deasy, a supporter of the computer and iPad program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The district's purchase of about 109,000 iPads in the program's first phase drew criticism after students bypassed security systems to surf the Web freely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The bidding process also came under fire and is being investigated by the FBI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last year, an oversight committee that reviews the district's use of bond proceeds rejected the plan, saying the school district had not proved that it was needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a statement emailed to reporters on Friday, Cortines said the district "does not have sufficient funds to purchase and maintain technology" under the program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cortines will urge the Board of Education to hold off purchasing any more of the equipment for the foreseeable future, a spokesman said.</td></tr>

<h3>The Islamic State threatens to come to Rome; Italians respond with travel advice</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Citizens in Rome do not seem too concerned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a recently released video that showed the killing of 21 Christians in Libya, all but one of them Egyptian, the Islamic State issued an ominous warning: "Today we are south of Rome," one masked militant said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We will conquer Rome with Allah's permission."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>To make matters worse, Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, pointed out that supporters of the Islamic State have begun using a hashtag to warn of their plan to reach "Rome."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Exactly what "Rome" means to the Islamic State is unclear -- some experts say it may actually be a reference to the United States or Turkey, or even the West in general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Italy is worried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Libya is just a short boat ride across the Mediterranean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Thousands of refugees already make this journey to Italian shores every year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>What's to stop the Islamic State?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As word of #We_Are_Coming_O_Rome spread across the Italian media, Rome residents took the opportunity to respondto the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And they did so in an especially Roman way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>With warnings about the traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>#We_Are_Coming_O_Rome are you sure?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>#We_Are_Coming_O_Rome ahahah Be careful on the highway-Ring Road: there's too much traffic, you would remain trapped!</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Isis: #We_Are_Coming_O_Rome beware the tires, is full of glass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>#We_Are_Coming_O_Rome hey just a tip: don't come in train, it's every time late!</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>#We_Are_Coming_O_Rome Ricordatevi pneumatici da neve o catene a bordo se prendete l'autostrada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Senno vi sequestrano il carro armato.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>(Translation: Remember snow tires or chains if you take the highway. Otherwise we sequester the tank.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>I'll be back in Rome within weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>#We_Are_Coming_O_Rome We are ready to meet you!</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>We have nice Colosseum plot for sale, Accept Credit Cards Securely, bargain price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>ISIS lancia l'hashtag #we_are_coming_o_rome Purtroppo per loro i tifosi del Feyenoord sono arrivati prima.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>By this point, the Italian responses to the hashtag far outweigh any from Islamic State supporters, and some Italian publications are beginning to wonder how notable the hashtag was to begin with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But the response does serve as a useful reminder: Italians may be scared of apocalyptic Islamic State warnings, but in their day-to-day life, they have many other issues on their minds.</td></tr>
