<h3>NYC's Bill de Blasio not ready for Hillary, yet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington (CNN)New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is holding off on endorsing Hillary Clinton, saying he wants to see "a clear, bold vision" first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>De Blasio, a progressive champion who managed Clinton's successful Senate campaign in 2000, said Clinton is among the most qualified presidential contenders in history and "she doesn't need to be vetted."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Who is Hillary Clinton?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>READ: What is Hillary Clinton thinking?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he demurred when asked on NBC's "Meet the Press" if he would endorse Clinton -- underscoring, at least in appearance, the left's hesitance about a candidate they see as too centrist and too close to Wall Street to address wage stagnation and income inequality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I think like a lot of people in this country I want to see a vision. And, again, that would be true of candidates on all levels. It's time to see a clear, bold vision for progressive economic change," De Blasio said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Host Chuck Todd then asked: "So you're technically not yet endorsing her?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"No, not until I see -- and, again, I would say this about any candidate -- until I see an actual vision of where they want to go," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His comments raised eyebrows given his status as a former top campaign aide and because Clinton campaigned with de Blasio during his bid for mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who also appeared on "Meet the Press," downplayed de Blasio's comments as a bad omen for Clinton from the left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Still, the Democrat said that "people don't want a coronation."</td></tr>
