<h3>Ukraine's president dismisses powerful regional governor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Poroshenko has fired the billionaire governor of an eastern region following a rancorous dispute pitting the tycoon against the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko gestures while speaking to Ihor Kolomoysky, governor of Dnipropetrovsk, in Kiev, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 25, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko dismissed the billionaire governor of an eastern region Wednesday following a rancorous dispute pitting the tycoon against the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Poroshenko's office said in a statement that Ihor Kolomoysky had asked to be released from his duties as governor of Dnipropetrovsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government last week followed through on its plans to dilute the power of Ukraine's ultra-rich business elite by pushing a law through parliament that led, in effect, to control over an oil and gas company being wrested from Kolomoysky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kolomoysky reacted by ordering armed groups of men to seize the offices of two energy companies in the capital, Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The episode has threatened to spark renewed political instability in Ukraine, which is battling Russian-backed separatists in eastern regions neighboring Dnipropetrovsk, as well as a sinking economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kolomoysky is a contentious figure in Ukraine - unafraid to use heavy-handed tactics in his business activities but also strongly committed to protecting Ukraine's territorial integrity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Over the past year, he has tapped into his wealth, which Forbes magazine estimates stands at $1.3 billion, to finance volunteer battalions waging war against separatist militias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Those battalions have since been subordinated to central government control, although it is believed Kolomoysky still retains considerable sway over them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While there is concern about how the showdown between Kolomoysky and the government could play out, many are greeting the move against him with relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Poroshenko said that Dnipropetrovsk should continue to serve as a defensive line for eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We must ensure peace, stability and tranquility. Dnipropetrovsk region should remain a bastion for Ukraine in the east, to protect the peace and tranquility of citizens," Poroshenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When then-President Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown last year in a mass street revolt fueled in part by anger over corruption, many hoped business would no longer continue as usual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chief among the figures distrusted by the public are the tycoons that earned their riches in the chaos of the post-independence period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The hyper-rich in the former Soviet Union influence politics and government more brazenly and openly than their Western counterparts, earning them the label of oligarchs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a move transparently designed to cut Kolomoysky down to size, the parliament last week adopted a law requiring only 50 percent of shareholders of joint stock companies to attend company meetings before decision could be taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The threshold was previously 60 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Poroshenko signed off on the law overnight Tuesday, around the time he was meeting with Kolomoysky to discuss the governor's dismissal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That measure had the most immediate ramifications for Kolomoysky, whose Privat Group conglomerate holds a 43-percent stake in oil and gas company Ukrnafta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Although the government-owned energy company Naftogaz controls just over 50 percent of Ukrnafta, Privat Group had - until now - been able to obstruct any policies going against Kolomoysky's interests.</td></tr>
