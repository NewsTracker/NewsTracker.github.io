<h3>Netanyahu flies to U.S.; signs of some easing of tensions over Iran speech seen</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Policy differences over the negotiations with Iran remained firm, however, as Netanyahu set off for the United States to deliver the speech, which has imperiled ties between the two allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Israel fears that U.S. President Barack Obama's Iran diplomacy, with an end-of-March deadline for a framework accord, will allow its arch foe to develop atomic weapons -something Tehran denies seeking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>By accepting an invitation from the Republican Party to address Congress on Tuesday, the Israeli leader infuriated the Obama administration, which said it was not told of the speech before plans were made public in an apparent breach of protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated Washington's determination to pursue negotiations with Iran, saying on Sunday the United States deserved "the benefit of the doubt" to see if a nuclear deal could be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Last week, Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, said the partisanship caused by Netanyahu's looming address was "destructive to the fabric of U.S.-Israeli ties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Asked about this on the ABC program "This Week," Kerry said "the prime minister of Israel is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously. And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said he had talked to Netanyahu on Saturday, adding, "we don't want to see this turned into some great political football."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Israel and the United States agreed that the main goal was to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In remarks on Saturday at Jersualem's Western Wall, Netanyahu said: "I would like to take this opportunity to say that I respect U.S. President Barack Obama."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He added that he believed in the strong bilateral ties and said, "that strength will prevail over differences of opinion, those in the past and those yet to come."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu did not repeat those remarks as he departed on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Israeli prime minister, who is running for re-election in a March 17 ballot, has framed his visit as being above politics and he portrayed himself as being a guardian for all Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I'm going to Washington on a fateful, even historic, mission," he said as he boarded his plane in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I feel that I am an emissary of all Israel's citizens, even those who do not agree with me, and of the entire Jewish people," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Netanyahu is expected to use his speech to urge Congress to approve new sanctions against Iran despite Obama's pledge to veto such legislation because it would jeopardize nuclear talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>U.S. officials fear he is seeking to sabotage the Iran diplomacy, and critics have suggested his visit is an elaborate election stunt that will play well with voters back home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>With Obama past the midpoint of his final term, his aides see an Iran nuclear deal as a potential signature achievement for a foreign policy legacy notably short on major successes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While White House and Israeli officials insist that key areas of cooperation, from counterterrorism to intelligence to cybersecurity, will remain unaffected, the divide over the Iran talks has shaped up as the worst in decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Previously Israel has always been careful to navigate between the Republican and Democratic camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The planned address, however, has driven a rare wedge between Netanyahu's government and some congressional Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Some two dozen or more of them plan to boycott the speech, according to unofficial estimates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Speaking in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Netanyahu of trying to undermine the nuclear talks in order to distract from the Palestinians' unresolved bid for an independent state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Netanyahu is opposed to any sort of solution," Zarif said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Hard-line U.S. supporters of Israel say Netanyahu must take center-stage in Washington to sound the alarm over the potential Iran deal, even at the risk of offending long-time supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the "politicized" nature of his visit threatened "what undergirds the strength of the relationship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As one former U.S. official put it: "Sure, when Netanyahu calls the White House, Obama will answer. But how fast will he be about responding (to a crisis)?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Last month, U.S. officials accused the Israeli government of leaking information to the Israeli media to undermine the Iran negotiations and said this would limit further sharing of sensitive details about the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"What the prime minister is doing here is simply so egregious that it has a more lasting impact on that fundamental underlying relationship," said Jeremy Ben-Ami, head of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel lobbying group aligned with Obama's Iran policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Netanyahu will address the influential pro-Israel lobby AIPAC on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Even as he makes his hard-line case against Iran, he is expected to try to keep tensions from spiraling, mindful that Israelis are wary of becoming estranged from their superpower ally.</td></tr>

<h3>TV review: Broadchurch season two finale</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>No doubt those who stuck with Broadchurch all the way through the maddening second series of the hit British crime drama were hoping that the finale might iron out the season's earlier unevenness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Maybe fill in a few holes in its plot logic too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It wasn't to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Broadchurch II ended with a double - or possible triple - clunk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It came with a hasty resolve of the Sandbrook case, which hadn't really done enough to engage interest through the previous seven episodes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That was despite the toll, oh the toll, it had taken on Detective Inspector Alec Hardy (David Tennant) and which had caused to him to be transferred to Broadchurch in the first place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There was the very guility Joe Miller being declared not guilty after the cheap-trick cliffhanger jury verdict announcement of the penultimate episode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Then came Joe's banishment by the good folk of Broadchurch who stood around and watched him go, either too exhausted to form a decent lynch mob or looking artfully arranged for the cast publicity photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yes, the officially innocent Joe Miller was sent to Coventry ... by being sent to Sheffield, the threats of his estranged wife about what she would do should he return, ringing in his ears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Though you have to wonder that his acquittal was more to do with creating a bogeyman for future seasons - a Broadchurch III has been announced - and less to do with saying something about the flaws of adversarial British criminal justice system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Or what happens when crap lawyers take over a murder case which has rocked a tight-knit community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As a courtroom drama, Broadchurch was pretty weak, the show cutting to the trial seemingly only when another net of red herrings was about to be dumped upon the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At least the final episode was relatively free of the rivalry between old legal foes Joceyln Knight (Charlotte Rampling) and Sharon Bishop (Marianne Jean-Baptiste.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The latter had spent the season delivering all her lines as if talking to a deaf elderly relative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Their scenes of mutual antipathy had become surplus to requirements many episodes earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As there had been in earlier episodes, last night's finale came with moments where the acting saved the unlikeliness of the material.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Especially when Beth Latimer (Jodie Whittaker, terrific), flanked by husband Mark and Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman, also great) , finally confronted Joe Miller face-to-face in the clifftop cottage where he had killed her son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That rang true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>So did the scenes between the insufferable Hardy and the suffering Ellie Miller as they confronted the three arrested Sandbrook suspects, clever Miller having figured out that when it came to the trio covering up the deaths of the two girls, there was a floor (sorry) in their plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The story behind the murder of the two girls was certainly a fiendish construction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A perfect storm of evil impulses from Lee and Claire Ashworth and the girls' father/uncle Ricky Gillespie resulted in two dead and a pact to cover up the truth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But you wouldn't want to measure the revelations about the case on the logic-o-meter, or the batty behaviour of the Ashworths in earlier episodes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Anyway, it was hard to care much about the Sandbrook subplot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The truth of it coming out was but a slighty satisfying resolution in the finale of a much less than satisfying second series.</td></tr>
