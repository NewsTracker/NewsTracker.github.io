<h3>Google forced to apologise after contractor threatens to remove gay bars from search engine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Still listed: The Shift Bar & Club on Google Maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For a company that prides itself on being a pride ambassador, this was an awfully embarrassing gaffe at the hands of a contractor thousands of kilometres away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Staff at a gay bar in Sydney were seeking help to update the venue's details on Google Maps when they were told that Google did not support gay bars and would remove the listing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I cannot believe what I am hearing," Shift Bar promoter Ash Doran posted on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Oxford Street fixture: The Shift Club will remain on Google Maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In a conference call at the moment with Google as they are advising that they are removing Midnight Shift's google page 'because its a gay bar' and Google 'no longer supports gay bars' and they will be doing it to other gay bars."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A subsequent email, also posted by Mr Doran online, appeared to confirm Google's stance, declaring that gay night clubs did not meet the company's "quality guidelines".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When contacted by Fairfax Media, a Google Australia spokeswoman confirmed the incident had unfolded as Mr Doran had described.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We're truly sorry that this happened," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Gay bars are welcome on Google Maps, as they have always been. We're taking immediate action internally to make sure this doesn't happen again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The reaction from Mr Doran's Facebook followers was one of disbelief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Google's track record as a supporter of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) is well established.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The tech giant is a sponsor of Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, and co-signed an open letter backing marriage equality in Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is understood the bar staff had been corresponding with a contractor working for Google at a call centre in India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Multinational corporations commonly use external contractors to staff international help desks in other countries, where they may work alongside the company's direct employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Adding to the online commentary, Google employee Andrew Ure offered an apology on the company's behalf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We're truly sorry that this happened. We're big believers in diversity," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We will make sure the Shift's listing stays proudly up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Shift Bar & Club, previously known as The Midnight Shift, is one of Sydney's flagship LGBTI venues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The bar's management was contacted for further comment.</td></tr>
