<h3>Apple working on a fix to glitch that lets pranksters crash iPhones</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A newly-discovered glitch in Apple's software can cause iPhones to mysteriously shut down when they receive a certain text message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple says it's aware of the problem and is working on a fix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But some pranksters are sharing information about the glitch on social media and using it to crash other peoples' phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The problem only occurs when the iPhone receives a message with a specific string of characters, including some Arabic characters, according to several tech blogs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When an iPhone isn't being used, it typically shows a shortened version of the message on the phone's lock screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That shortened combination of characters apparently triggers the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Affected phones will restart automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Owners can prevent the problem by using phone settings to turn off the message "previews" feature.</td></tr>
