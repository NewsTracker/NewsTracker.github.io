<h3>Firefighters wake up to smoke in station, then battle blaze</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nine Salt Lake City firefighters who escaped the fire that erupted at their own station were taken to a hospital to be checked for smoke inhalation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fire Department spokesman Jasen Asay says in a statement that the nine firefighters fled the building and returned with a truck to fight the blaze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Firefighters are used to alarms in the middle of the night, but the smoke doesn't usually come to their front door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A group of sleeping Salt Lake City firefighters cracked open the door of their upstairs dorm room early Tuesday to find smoke pouring inside from a fire that erupted at their own station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They closed the door and jumped on the room's fire pole to flee the flames, then quickly returned to the building with a firetruck to battle the blaze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They wake up, and within a minute, they're fighting a fire in their second home," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two dozen additional firefighters soon joined them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When the fire was extinguished, nine firefighters were taken to a hospital to be evaluated for smoke inhalation and then released several hours later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They love their station and needed to react quickly, and they did a good job of that," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Still, it was an emotional morning, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Crews usually have a few minutes to prepare themselves before they start putting out a fire, but that was impossible Tuesday as the blaze spread in a place with special meaning for many of the city's firefighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The station is one of Salt Lake City's oldest, and most of the department's 325 firefighters have worked there at some point, Asay said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It means a lot to the entire department, especially to the nine firefighters who were there this morning," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Investigators are trying to determine what caused the accidental blaze, which left the second floor of the building with heavy damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It started in a utility room with a soda machine where linens and rags are stored and spread to the kitchen and the building's vent system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Smoke woke up two captains sleeping on the first floor about 1:30 a.m., and they called to the other seven firefighters upstairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>All the firefighters based at the damaged building are working out of other stations until their facility gets repaired.</td></tr>

<h3>WIRELESS SHOW HIGHLIGHTS: Eyes on Apple, BlackBerry</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple's campaign comes as Samsung unveiled new phones with improved photo-taking capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The two companies have been fierce rivals, and one research firm said Tuesday that Apple bested Samsung as the world's top smartphone maker in the last three months of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple Inc. isn't at the Mobile World Congress show this week, but is making its presence felt, as new phones are inevitably compared with iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple has its own event Monday in San Francisco, where it's expected to reveal more details about its upcoming smartwatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple is turning over a large portion of its home page, along with billboard and print ads in dozens of cities, to photos from its "Shot on iPhone 6" campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company collected photos from 77 users around the world by combing through Flickr, Instagram and other sites (and getting permissions from the photographers).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple is featuring 57 photos and three videos from those users at http://apple.com/worldgallery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The rest are on print ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple is seeking to show that people can take quality images with iPhones, without needing to buy and carry a stand-alone camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The photo captions describe what makes each image stand out and present tips and information on any apps and accessories used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The campaign launched Sunday just as Samsung Electronics Co. announced its new Galaxy S6 phones, which promise improved focus, low-light capabilities and color adjustments to account for ambient light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Before iPhones came around, there was the BlackBerry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But iPhones - and later, Android phones - showed people that smartphones can do much more than email and calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>BlackBerry was late in modernizing its operating system to offer those capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At the show Tuesday, BlackBerry CEO John Chen reiterated the company's "philosophical" shift away from merely making devices to becoming a leader in software, especially for businesses and even rivals such as Samsung.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nonetheless, BlackBerry said it may launch four new smartphones over the coming year, including the BlackBerry Leap, a "low-to-mid" market phone that will go on sale in Europe in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although the Leap has a touch-screen keyboard, BlackBerry's head of devices, Ron Louks, told The Associated Press that BlackBerry remains committed to making models with its signature physical keyboards.</td></tr>
