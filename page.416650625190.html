<h3>Pictures of movie theatre carnage shown for 1st time at James Holmes shooting trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The bodies lay where they fell, sprawled on steps or wedged between rows of seats, surrounded by spent ammunition, scattered popcorn and shoes left behind in the panic to escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutors showed jurors graphic crime scene photos Thursday in the Colorado theater shooting trial, the first time images of the bloodshed were made public since the July 20, 2012, attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>One juror briefly turned his head after looking at one of the photos displayed on a video screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Most jurors studied the images intently but showed no emotion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some spectators in the gallery wept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A woman broke down in sobs and left the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Twelve people were killed and 70 injured in attack at the Century 16 theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ten victims died at the theater, while the other two were pronounced dead at hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If James Holmes - who has admitted he was the shooter - felt any reaction to the photos, it wasn't visible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He watched from the defense table, where he is tethered to the floor by a harness and cable under his street clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was a grim ending to the first short week of the trial, which won't resume until Monday to accommodate plans that one juror made before the case got underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The photos added still more emotional weight to the prosecution's case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since testimony began Tuesday, jurors have heard victims describe the burning pain of gunshot wounds and the agony of watching loved ones collapse before their eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Police officers - some so overwhelmed by grief they had to pause to pull themselves together - described rushing to hospitals with gasping victims in their patrol cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Defense attorneys say his mind is so distorted by schizophrenia that he didn't know right from wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If the jury finds he was insane, he would be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Prosecutors have described Holmes as calculating and smart, and they say he believed killing others increased his self-worth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They are asking jurors to convict him of murder and sentence him to be executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Police officers testified Thursday that Holmes seemed keenly interested in the attack's aftermath, peering out the window of a squad car as injured victims were treated nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He first wore a vacant expression and seemed calm and detached - but sweaty and smelly - after police handcuffed him in the parking lot behind the theater, the officers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But when they placed him in the police car near a back door to the theater, "he would look around like he was taking it all in," Aurora police officer Jason Oviatt said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It was a tumultuous scene, with emergency responders treating the wounded and loading them into police cars to be rushed to hospitals because no ambulances had arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"He would sort of look around whenever a car went speeding past or when there was something else going on, somebody shouting outside the car," Oviatt said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Prosecutors called four law-enforcement officers as witnesses Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>For the first time since testimony began, the defense cross-examined some of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Questioned by defense lawyer Daniel King, the officers said Holmes had disheveled, reddish-orange hair, that his pupils were extremely dilated and that he appeared disoriented and stared off into space when he was first arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>King's questions mirrored an argument the defense made in opening statements - that Holmes' behavior was shaped by his mental illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Holmes' mother, Arlene, attempted to pass a note to the defense table from her seat nearby in the gallery Thursday, but a deputy intercepted it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Arlene Holmes then left the courtroom with her husband, Bob, and defense attorney Tamara Brady.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It wasn't clear what the note said or why they left.</td></tr>
