<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A federal judge has narrowed a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the family of Michael Brown Jr. against the city of Ferguson, Missouri, its former police chief and the ex-police officer who fatally shot the black 18-year-old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber on Tuesday dismissed four of the seven counts from the suit filed in April.</td></tr>
