<h3>European shares fall on weak data, jitters over Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Shares fell in Europe on Thursday, sapped by doubts over the Greek bailout plan and gloomy manufacturing data from the region, China and Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Asian markets were mostly higher on hopes for further economic stimulus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>KEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX fell 1.1 percent to 11,739.81 and France's CAC 40 lost 1 percent to 5,161.20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.2 percent to 7,015.15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wall Street likewise looked set for a slow start, with Dow and S&P futures both down 0.4 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>GREECE GLOOM: An agreement with Greece's European creditors on additional reforms in exchange for rescue money due for the end of April remains far off ahead of a meeting Friday in the Latvian capital of Riga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The lack of a plan to protect Greece from defaulting and even dropping the euro is clouding prospects for its recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>MANUFACTURING MALAISE: A preliminary survey of factory managers showed Eurozone business activity slowed in April from March's 11-month high, reflecting weaker rates of expansion for France and Germany despite accelerating growth elsewhere in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>THE QUOTE: "U.S. and European equities have been seeing some choppy trade with a bit of uncertainty around earnings data and Greece. This is unlikely to change in the near term and could be a deterrent for some investors for the time being," Stan Shamu, a market strategist for IG, said in a commentary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>ASIA'S DAY: Asian investors shrugged off fresh data showing economic weakness in China and Japan, as investors pinned their hopes on further stimulus measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Japan's Nikkei 225 remained above the 20,000 mark it broached for the first time in 15 years the day before, gaining 0.3 percent to 20,187.65.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Shanghai Composite added 0.4 percent to 4,414.51 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed early gains, falling 0.4 percent to 27,827.70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>South Korea's Kospi gained 1.4 percent to 2,173.41.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Australia's S&P ASX/200 edged 0.1 percent higher to 5,844.80 and markets in Southeast Asia were mixed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>ASIA MANUFACTURING: HSBC said Thursday that a preliminary version of its index based on a survey of factory purchasing managers fell to 49.2 in April, its lowest point in a year, from 49.6 in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Readings below 50 indicate contraction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The fresh sign that growth is faltering in the world's second biggest economy will add to pressure on policymakers in Beijing to act to stave off a sharper slowdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile, a similar survey in Japan showed a third straight monthly fall in manufacturing, suggesting industries are still not in full recovery mode after the recession brought on by a sales tax hike on April 1, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 26 cents to $55.90 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It fell 45 cents to $56.16 a barrel on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Brent crude fell 49 cents to $62.24 a barrel in London.</td></tr>
