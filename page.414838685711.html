<h3>Report: Islamic State Militants Burn 45 People To Death In Iraq</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The motive was unknown but Colonel Qasim al-Obeidi said on February 17 he believed some of the victims were members of the security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said a compound that houses the families of security personnel and local officials was now under attack, and pleaded for help from the government and international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report could not be immediately confirmed due to the fighting and the poor communications in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>IS fighters captured much of the town of Al-Baghdadi, near Ain al-Asad air base, last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Militants subsequently attacked the base on February 13, but the attack was repelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>U.S. and Iraqi officials said eight militants were killed in that attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some 300 U.S. military personnel have been training Iraqi troops at the base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Earlier this month, IS posted a video showing militants burning alive a Jordanian air force pilot, whose plane crashed in Syria in December.</td></tr>
