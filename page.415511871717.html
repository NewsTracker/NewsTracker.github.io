<h3>U.S. Ebola patient now in critical condition: NIH</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The healthcare worker was evacuated from West Africa and arrived at the NIH clinical center on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The clinician, who has not been identified, was working with Partners In Health at the medical aid group's Sierra Leone Ebola center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Partners in Health said in a statement that 10 of its clinicians in Sierra Leone came to the aid of their ailing colleague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They were all subsequently identified as contacts of the patient being treated at NIH.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 10 individuals were flown to the United States via non-commercial aircraft to be monitored at designated Ebola treatment facilities to give them access to rapid testing and, if necessary, treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Four are being monitored by doctors at Nebraska Medicine; one of them developed symptoms on Sunday evening and was moved into the Nebraska Medicine biocontainment facility, Dr. Phil Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, Smith said some of those symptoms have since resolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"At this point, this person has not tested positive for the Ebola virus," Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The hospital said a fifth person from the original exposure group in Sierra Leone is being transferred to the Nebraska facility for monitoring later on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The healthcare workers will voluntarily isolate themselves during the remainder of the 21-day Ebola incubation period, Partners in Health said.</td></tr>
