<h3>Report to criticize Ferguson police for discriminatory practices</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - The Justice Department has nearly completed a highly critical report accusing the police in Ferguson, Mo., of making discriminatory traffic stops of blacks that created years of racial animosity leading up to an officer's shooting of a black teenager last summer, law enforcement officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to several officials who have been briefed on the report's conclusions, the report criticizes the city for disproportionately ticketing and arresting blacks and relying on the fines to balance the city's budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report, which is expected to be released as early as this week, will force Ferguson officials to either negotiate a settlement with the Justice Department or face being sued on civil rights charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Either way, the result is likely to be significant changes inside the Ferguson Police Department, which is at the center of a national debate over race and policing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ferguson erupted into angry, sometimes violent protests after a white police officer, Darren Wilson, shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Justice Department investigated that shooting, and officials have said they will clear the officer of civil rights charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the report into the broader practices of the local Police Department will give the context for the shooting, describing the mounting sense of frustration and anger in a predominantly black city where the police and local government are mostly white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While the Justice Department's exact findings are not yet known, Attorney General Eric Holder and other officials have said publicly that their investigation has focused on the use of excessive force and the treatment of prisoners in local jails, as well as the traffic stops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Blacks accounted for 86 percent of traffic stops in 2013 but make up 63 percent of the population, according to the most recent data published by the Missouri attorney general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And once they were stopped, black drivers were twice as likely to be searched, even though searches of white drivers were more likely to turn up contraband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Investigators do not need to prove Ferguson's policies are racially motivated or that the police intentionally singled out minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They need to show only that police tactics had a "disparate impact" on blacks and that this was avoidable.</td></tr>
