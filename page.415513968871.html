<h3>Facebook report shows rise in government requests for data</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook recorded a slight increase in government requests for account data globally in the second half of 2014, according to its Global Government Requests Report, which also includes information about content removal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Requests for account data increased to 35,051 in the second half of 2014 from 34,946 in the first half, with requests from countries such as India and Australia rising and those from others including United States and Germany falling, the report by the world's largest internet social network showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook said it restricted 9707 pieces of content for violating local laws, 11 per cent more than in the first half, with only three of those as a result of Australian requests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The report states those three items were taken down as a result of a request from "a local state consumer affairs regulator" for violating laws than ban misleading information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Inida was the country with most pieces of content restricted, at a total of 5832.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Government requests for information rose substantially in Australia, with 829 requests (for data relating to a total of 933 users) made in the second half of the year, compared with 610 requests (for a total of 650 users) in the previous half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The relative number of requests that actually resulted in Facebook giving up information also rose, from 60.33 per cent of requests in the first half of 2014 to 68.64 per cent in the second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The country which made the largest number of requests for user data was the United States, with 14,274 requests for information related to a total of 21,731 users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Data was provided as a result of 79.14 per cent of the requests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We will continue to scrutinise each government request and push back when we find deficiencies. We will also continue to push governments around the world to reform their surveillance practices in a way that maintains the safety and security of their people while ensuring their rights and freedoms are protected," Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management wrote in a blog post that also shed light on the kinds of content Facebook does and does not remove as a result of user reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bickert said Facebook challenges requests that appear to be "unreasonable" or "overbroad" and if a country requests content be removed because it is illegal, Facebook may restrict access only in that country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The technology industry has pushed for greater transparency on government data requests, seeking to shake off concerns about their involvement in vast, surreptitious surveillance programs revealed by former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo and Google last year began publishing details about the number of government requests for data they receive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Facebook on Sunday also updated its community standards to tell users what types of posts are not allowed on the service, providing guidance on policies related to self-injury, dangerous organizations, bullying and harassment, criminal activity, sexual violence and exploitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Love Mobile Data?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>With data rolling over into the next month for your use.</td></tr>
