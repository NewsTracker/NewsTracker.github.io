<h3>European stocks claw back ground as Greece remains in focus</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON (AP) - European stock markets clawed back some recent losses Wednesday as Greece tried again to break the deadlock with its international creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The big mover across financial markets was the yen, which surged after Japan's central bank chief said further falls in the currency's value were unlikely to happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany's DAX, which earlier this week entered official correction territory having fallen 10 percent from its peak, was up 1.1 percent at 11,117.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>France's CAC-40 was 0.8 percent higher at 4,885 while the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 0.4 percent to 6,779.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>U.S. stocks were poised for solid gains at the open, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>GREEK TALKS: European markets, in particular, have been under the kosh of late, largely because of renewed worries over the financial future of Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The country's prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is hoping to make headway later at a meeting in Brussels with the leaders of Germany and France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece has three weeks to ink a deal to get creditors to release the final funds remaining in the country's bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Without the 7.2 billion euros ($8.1 billion), Greece faces the prospect of going bankrupt, putting up capital controls and ditching the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>ANALYST TAKE: "Both sides are operating on the firmly entrenched opinion that their own proposal is the most reasonable, and following the reported slap in the face of yesterday's Greek proposal, this is unlikely to change," said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>FED LOOMING: While Greece has provided much of the recent noise in financial markets, investors are also keeping a close watch on U.S. economic data as they assess when the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thursday's U.S. retail sales figures for May could provide a steer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The dollar is particularly vulnerable to changes in U.S. rate expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Wednesday it was flat against the euro, which was trading at $1.1283.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>YEN MOVES: The main development in foreign exchange markets centered on the yen, which jumped after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the currency is not likely to continue falling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In response, the dollar fell 1 percent to 123.12 yen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>CHINA INDEX: Global stock-index compiler MSCI Inc. said it would not be including Chinese stocks in its global benchmarks until after a few issues related to market accessibility are resolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Many investors had expected approval this week but the decision to put it on hold sent Shanghai shares slightly lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The benchmark has surged in the past few days, driven by the expectation that inclusion in MSCI indexes would spur more capital into Chinese markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Expectations of new economic stimulus measures in China have also boosted Chinese stocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>On Wednesday, the Shanghai Composite edged 0.1 percent lower to 5,106.04.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>ASIA'S DAY: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3 percent to close at 20,046.36 and South Korea's Kospi shed 0.6 percent to 2,051.32.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.1 percent to 26,687.64 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.1 percent lower at 5,478.60.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained $1.34 to $61.48 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The contract jumped $2.00 to close at $60.14 a barrel in Nymex floor trading on Tuesday after an Energy Department monthly report predicted a decline in U.S. output later this year and next.</td></tr>
