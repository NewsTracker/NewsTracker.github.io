<h3>FIFA banks $2B in 2014; World Cup turns $337M total profit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ZURICH (AP) " The World Cup's commercial power led to record revenue of $2 billion for FIFA last year, with $337 million in profits coming from the four-year cycle leading up to the 2014 soccer tournament in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA, which pocketed $140.7 million in profit in 2014 alone, added $91 million to its reserves, which now stand at $1.523 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The revenue of $2.096 billion in 2014 raised the four-year total to $5.718 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Income should keep rising before the 2018 World Cup in Russia despite FIFA's reputation being battered by corruption and vote-buying allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This success underscores the huge appeal of FIFA's flagship tournament," the governing body noted in its annual financial report published Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>FIFA's expenses also soared, topping $5.38 billion in the past four years, including $1.955 billion in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Spending last year included: $261 million in World Cup bonuses to member federations and confederations; $27 million buying a four-star hotel near the world soccer museum site in Zurich; and $39.7 million in executive committee stipends and senior management bonuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>FIFA again spent more rewarding senior officials than it committed to its signature Goal program for development projects: $36.6 million in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As usual, FIFA President Sepp Blatter's salary and bonus package was not detailed in the accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, a FIFA-appointed remuneration panel decided that Blatter and senior managers were "within the range" of packages paid by comparable "global companies," the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>FIFA also paid $36 million in tax in 2014, due on its profits plus revenue earned by subsidiary companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The FIFA accounts show its dependence on the World Cup " generating 84 percent of all revenue from 2011-14 " and also the tournament's relentless popularity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The content we have is unique and fantastic and 2014 was another proof of that," FIFA finance director Markus Kattner said at a briefing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Even though FIFA signed most broadcasters and sponsors to two-tournament deals covering 2010 and 2014, revenue still rose sharply for the second event, which was more entertaining, better organized and safer than many predicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"And in the end the finances were OK as well, so what do you criticize?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Kattner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>FIFA said revenue tied directly to the tournament in Brazil was $4.826 billion, compared to $3.655 billion for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Much of the increase is due to an accounting change which includes ticket sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>FIFA also banked a $61 million profit-share bonus from MATCH Hospitality for lucrative corporate seat sales in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The 2014 World Cup was also the most expensive to stage with total FIFA costs of $2.224 billion, including $35 million to the winning Germany federation.</td></tr>
