<tr><td>4</td><td>In the next phase of the trial, the jury will hear evidence on whether Tsarnaev should get the death penalty or spend the rest of his life in prison.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>A federal jury found Tsarnaev guilty Wednesday in the 2013 terror attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>The jury will now decide whether the 21-year-old former college student should be sentenced to death or receive life in prison.</td></tr>
