<h3>FIFA to elect Blatter successor on December 16 - BBC</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON (Reuters) - Scandal-hit FIFA is likely to elect a new president at a Dec. 16 emergency meeting in Zurich, the BBC reported on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The BBC has learned that is the likely date for an emergency meeting in Zurich to decide his successor," the report said without citing sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Representatives from all 209 member associations will be invited to the Swiss city to vote in a new presidential election," it added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FIFA president Sepp Blatter tendered his resignation last Tuesday, less than a week after Swiss police staged a dawn raid on a luxury hotel in Zurich and arrested several officials on corruption charges filed by U.S. prosecutors in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, Blatter is intent on staying in office until his successor is appointed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"A final decision on the date for a presidential election is not expected to be made until July, but it is believed holding an emergency congress in mid-December is Blatter's preferred option," the BBC added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FIFA confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that its executive committee would meet in July to pick a date for the full presidential vote, with various options set to be discussed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jordan's Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, who lost out to Blatter in election, is tipped as a possible candidate while Chung Mong-joon, the billionaire scion of South Korea's Hyundai conglomerate, is also weighing up his bid to replace Blatter.</td></tr>
