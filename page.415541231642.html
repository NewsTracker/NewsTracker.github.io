<h3>Flume set to light up Vivid Sydney</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The softly spoken 23-year-old electronic artist behind hits such as Holdin On has kept largely off the radar in Australia since winning four gongs at the 2013 ARIA Awards, including Best Male Artist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Vivid Music Curator Stephen Ferris says Flume has actually been "everywhere" since the release of his breakthrough self-titled album.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Which, he told AAP, is a major plus for the Aussie electronic scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"He's sort of dragging this flow of electronic new acts all around the world that are Australian because they know him and they look to see what else is coming from (here)," he said at the Vivid Sydney program launch on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"And it sort of represents a sound we've really created here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Flume will play on the outdoor northern point of the Sydney Opera House as part of the Future Classic 10th Anniversary in Australia from May 29-30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Other highlights in the Vivid music program include performances by Daniel Johns (making his long-awaited solo debut), indie veteran Morrissey, Sufjan Stevens and ARIA Hall of Famers The Hoodoo Gurus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The iconic Aussie group will see all eight past and present members recreating their history and hit songs together onstage within the Powerhouse Museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"... we're getting all the ex-members back ... we're going to recreate all those different parts of the bands' history and the finale will be all of us onstage together playing this crazy tribal finale."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Other highlights of the Vivid Festival include the beloved Vivid Light Walk through the Sydney CBD and surrounds, and a talk by Emmy-winning writer and producer Matthew Weiner - famous for his work on The Sopranos and Mad Men - as part of Vivid Ideas.</td></tr>
