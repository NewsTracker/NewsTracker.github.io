<h3>Exclusive: Despite Hillary Clinton promise, charity did not disclose donors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (Reuters) - In 2008, Hillary Clinton promised Barack Obama, the president-elect, there would be no mystery about who was giving money to her family's globe-circling charities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She made a pledge to publish all the donors on an annual basis to ease concerns that as secretary of state she could be vulnerable to accusations of foreign influence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At the outset, the Clinton Foundation did indeed publish what they said was a complete list of the names of more than 200,000 donors and has continued to update it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But in a breach of the pledge, the charity's flagship health program, which spends more than all of the other foundation initiatives put together, stopped making the annual disclosure in 2010, Reuters has found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In response to questions from Reuters, officials at the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and the foundation confirmed no complete list of donors to the Clintons' charities has been published since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>CHAI was spun off as a separate legal entity that year, but the officials acknowledged it still remains subject to the same disclosure agreement as the foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The finding could renew scrutiny of Clinton's promises of transparency as she prepares to launch her widely expected bid for the White House in the coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Political opponents and transparency groups have criticized her in recent weeks for her decision first to use a private email address while she was secretary of state and then to delete thousands of emails she labeled private.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>CHAI, which is best known for helping to reduce the cost of drugs for people with HIV in the developing world, published a partial donor list for the first time only this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>CHAI should have published the names during 2010-2013, when Clinton was in office, CHAI spokeswoman Maura Daley acknowledged this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Not doing so was an oversight which we made up for this year," she told Reuters in an email when asked why it had not published any donor lists until a few weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A spokesman for Hillary Clinton declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Former President Bill Clinton, who also signed on to the agreement with the Obama administration, was traveling and could not be reached for comment, his spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Reuters inquiries also raised questions about a second assurance Hillary Clinton made to the Obama administration: that the State Department would be able to review any new or increased contributions to CHAI by foreign governments while she served as the nation's top diplomat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Clintons said the pledge was intended to defuse accusations that foreign governments might use such donations to earn favors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>By the time Clinton left office in February 2013, the charity had received millions of dollars (Graphic: reut.rs/1Lvua8z) in new or increased payments from at least seven foreign governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Five of the governments came on board during her tenure as secretary of state while two doubled or tripled their support in that time, according to data provided by CHAI spokeswoman Daley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The State Department said it was unable to cite any instances of its officials reviewing or approving new money from any foreign governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Daley confirmed that none of the seven government donations had been submitted to the State Department for review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>One instance was an admitted oversight, Daley said: CHAI should have told the State Department before accepting donations totaling $340,000 from Switzerland's Agency for Development and Cooperation in 2011 and 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>However, it did not believe U.S. authorities needed to review the other six governments, including Britain and Australia, she said, citing various reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Hillary Clinton told the Senate during her confirmation hearing in January, 2009, that the disclosures she and her husband agreed to were "very unprecedented."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At that time, she did not dispute the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's concerns that utter transparency was necessary to protect the integrity of the United States' diplomacy and foreign policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>BRITAIN, AUSTRALIA BOOSTED DONATIONS Since it was published in 2008, the foundation's online donor list has been updated annually, naming everyone from individuals giving a few dollars to governments awarding eight-figure grants, the foundation said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It has been pored over by interest groups, the Clintons' political opponents, and the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The foundation list has not included those who donated just to CHAI since the initiative was spun off in 2010, foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Minassian said the foundation believed CHAI continued to be bound by the agreement with the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He did not elaborate on why CHAI did not honor it and referred inquiries to Daley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In the donor list that CHAI published this year, for the first time since its spin-off from the Clinton Foundation, not all donors were identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Many were grouped together as "Individual Donations", which cumulatively came to less than $1 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Those donations were small and so "did not warrant posting," said Daley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In 2008, the Clintons agreed that existing government contributors that wanted to "materially increase" their commitments during Hillary Clinton's tenure would be reviewed by State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Australia almost doubled its support between 2009-2012, to $12.2 million, while the United Kingdom nearly tripled its support, to $11.2 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>CHAI did not report these increases to the State Department because the new money was for "expansions of existing programs," Daley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Daley also provided a number of explanations for why other governments that appeared on a donor list provided to Reuters did not need to be reviewed by the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Swaziland and Papua New Guinea, which gave small grants for AIDS programs, were not submitted for review because the money they gave originated from other sources, including existing donor Australia and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In the case of Sweden, its International Development Cooperation Agency has given CHAI $7.2 million since 2012 to train health workers in Zambia, but nothing in at least the previous three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>This did not need State review because Sweden had given to the foundation prior to 2009, Daley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Rwanda, which CHAI listed as a donor, gave the charity $200,000 in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>CHAI considered this a fee for medical work it did in the country, not a grant or donation, and so did not tell the State Department about it, Daley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Money from all of these governments amounted to about 1 percent of CHAI's total budget, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The White House declined to answer questions about whether the Obama administration was aware of CHAI not disclosing its donors or submitting new donations from foreign governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman noted, however, that the agreement the Clintons entered into "went above and beyond standard ethics requirements."</td></tr>

<h3>Stevie Wonder's 'Love's in Need of Love Today'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two years had passed since his last album with the label, "Fulfillingness' First Finale," which had been No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1 on Billboard's pop chart for two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Songs," by contrast, was a hefty double album with a four-song bonus EP that risked overwhelming the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Songs" defied the naysayers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The album quickly reached No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>1, where it stayed for 13 weeks, remaining on the chart for 80 weeks in all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This week, Mr. Wonder is launching the second North American leg of his "Songs in the Key of Life" tour in Denver, then visiting several other Midwestern and Eastern cities before wrapping it up April 12 in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He performs "Songs" in its entirety and the album recently returned to the chart at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>48. Last week, Mr. Wonder, 64, reflected on writing and recording the album's opening song, "Love's in Need of Love Today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Stevie Wonder: "Love's in Need of Love Today" wasn't the first song I wrote for the album, but there was something about it that insisted on being the album's opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>I wrote the song's basic idea in late 1974 in my hotel room in New York, when Yolanda [Simmons] was pregnant with our daughter Aisha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I remember it was so cold outside that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The concept I had in mind was that for love to be effective, it has to be fed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Love by itself is hollow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I recorded the song's demo in my hotel room on a Fender Rhodes using a portable Nakamichi cassette recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I used to take that recorder with me everywhere, like a notebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Capturing the song's basic feel this way was like a sketch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The cassette let me save my original thinking so I could get back into the same groove later in the recording studio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I didn't have all the words for the song at first, only the title phrase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>I started at the hotel by playing chords on the keyboard and humming along, adding just a few words where they felt right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To this day, I never sit down and formally write songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They emerge from the process of listening to what I'm doing on the keyboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>I just play and songs sort of happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Like a painter, I get my inspiration from experiences that can be painful or beautiful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I always start from a feeling of profound gratitude-you know, "Only by the grace of God am I here"-and write from there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>I think most songwriters are inspired by an inner voice and spirit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>God gave me this gift, and this particular song was a message I was supposed to deliver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Love's in Need" really began to take shape when I took the cassette demo into Crystal Sound in Hollywood, in 1975, and began recording.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>At Crystal Sound, I was playing chords and humming along, adding lyrics and phrases as I heard the music evolve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I wanted to feel the song and move with the music rather than try to control it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The cadence and melody came first, and then by humming harmony up high like this [illustrates], I was inspired to add lyrics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Though I had recorded the demo on a Fender Rhodes in the key of D, I decided to record the song at Crystal Sound in E-flat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The slightly higher key was better for my voice and felt better, spiritually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Almost immediately, the song felt significant, so I wanted to do something different with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Rather than start with an instrumental, I developed a choral introduction to set the song's tone, and the gospel harmony I wrote came naturally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>When I overdubbed my voice singing all the choir's vocal parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>I knew my harmonized voices had to be clear but that my lead vocal had to be heard above the rest, not tucked in the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The song was going to be a sermon, telling people that love was in need of love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Mr. Wonder promoting the album Songs In The Key Of Life in 1976.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>As I worked on the introduction, it began to feel like one of those gospel radio shows I heard as a child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>So after the choir introduction, I came up with [sings] "Good morn or evening friends / Here's your friendly announcer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>I was thinking about those churches that had radio programs back in the day and how an announcer would come on and say, "Good morning or good evening everyone in radioland. I want to give you a message"-the whole deal, you know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>My inspiration was the gospel quartets of the 1950s, like the one Sam Cooke was in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>When I sang my final vocal on top, I imagined Sam in the studio with me-his spirit and energy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>While developing the song in the studio, I began to play and record all of the other instruments and layer them in-including the clavinet, bass synthesizer and drums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Eddie "Bongo" Brown played the congas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>I also added the sound of strings using a Yamaha GX-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>I used to call it the Dream Machine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>I didn't want full strings, just a light Al Green feel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>I wasn't thinking of Al's vocal, just the single-note unison string sound on his records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>After adding the strings, I decided that was enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The rest of the process was fitting everything together like pieces of a puzzle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>I always like my songs to fit right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Finalizing "Love's in Need" was just a matter of listening back and deciding what should stay in and what should come out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>It's about creating a marriage of all the instruments and vocals, bringing them together to make a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>It's similar to the way arrangers hear all the parts in their head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Whether it's the Beatles, Sly Stone, Prince or Ed Sheeran, you start with an idea or vision and bring what you hear in your mind to reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>When I'm doing this, I become all the different musicians and approach the song from each musician's understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Fine-tuning also was key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>For example, I originally sang an ad-libbed solo toward the end and then decided my ad-lib alone wasn't enough so I added the keyboard to play the melody I was singing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>In another case, on a playback, I noticed that my bass notes weren't deep enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>I sped up the tape a little when recording, which let my voice hit the lower notes when the tape played back at the normal speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>When I was finished, I listened to the playback and realized the song was perfect to open the album, to set the entire tone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>As for the album's title, I actually dreamed it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The point is that life is endless, so there will forever be songs about things that happen in life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>But hearing the song back in the studio also hurt, because it was so emotional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>It's still emotional for me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>When I performed it in New York recently, I broke down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>I've seen people come and go, and live and die, cry and laugh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>It all came rushing back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>I googled the chords for Cheri Amour recently.They were provided (accurately) by a kid who annotated them: "here is a tune from some old music I found in my grandparents house. It's really good..."</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>My best friend, still my best friend, gave me this album for Christmas in '76.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Always loved the album and could never understand the popularity of the singles that charted the highest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>They were the weakest songs on the album.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>I might have been the only kid in all-white Armonk to buy the album and keep listening to it over the following few years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Thanks for telling the story behind a beautiful song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>I'll go pull out that vinyl when I get home this evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Bought "Songs in the Key of Life" when it was first released all those years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Fell in love with it and...in my book, one of the top 10 albums of all time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Stevie is a rare "natural" musical genius and this album showcases his style perfectly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Truly in a league of his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Even to this day...still play some of my favorites on this album and they're magical and amazing...can't say this about most music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>I wonder if Sam Cook's kids will sue Stevie?</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>I saw Stevie perform "Songs in the Key of Life" live in Chicago last November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>It was a moving experience for me and one that I highly recommend to anyone who can be lucky enough to experience it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Why does this so called music sound so degrading and an assault upon my ears and feelings of content?</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>@James Ewins "We're like licorice. Not everybody likes licorice, but the people who like licorice really like licorice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Stevie Wonder has always been one of my favorites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>It is a privilege to get a glimpse inside the mind of a musical genius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>We are the same age, Stevie and I.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>I remember him on Ed Sullivan singing "Fingertips Part II" and being blown away, like seeing the Beatles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>I have been a devoted fan ever since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>This album is in the top three for me, leading much of the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>That has always been my favorite Stevie Wonder song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>Amazing to see how it came together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>I know no one is going to be interested in this, but in appreciation for my brother I tell it anyway: Steve (my brother) was in his first year at Berklee College of Music.He played trombone, and as an extraordinary talent (having received 2 full scholarships to Berklee - one from Berklee and one from Downbeat magazine) was the #1 trombonist in the school towards the end of the school year (this goes back to around 1970/1971).Berklee, primarily known then as a jazz school, was such that when a musician was needed by a group, oftentimes the top musician on that instrument at Berklee would be snatched up.Steve left school towards the end of the year to join with me in forming a jazz/rock group (we were of course going to be wildly successful - Not!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Not very long after my brother left Berklee, along came Stevie Wonder needing a trombonist - and #2 to my brother got the nod.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>I listened to Songs in the Key of Life countless times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>What an amazing album.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>What an amazing man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>@philip seltzer This is exactly how I feel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>It is wonderful to get a real glimpse at Stevie Wonder's songwriting process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>He makes it sound and look so easy - but it ain't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>What a bummer, WSJ, that in order to listen to this song on your website, I have to sign up for SPOTIFY, or give them my personal information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>No thanks!</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>@Laura Laredo You might try finding someone who can help you navigate techology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>I'm listening to it right now on Spotify without a subscription and without parting with any personal information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>@Laura Laredo You hit the ad for Spotify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>I remember waiting anxiously for "Songs" and it did not disappoint.Not sure why, but it was the last Stevie Wonder album that I really, truly loved.The 5 Albums from "Music of My Mind", "Talking Book", "Intervisions", "Fulfillingless Full Finales" and "Songs" are still 5 of my favorite albums.I love Motown and I wonder what happened to that sound.I guess Hip/Hop & Rap usurped it ... too bad in my opionion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>Stevie Wonder is a wonder -he is one incredible talent that has given me many, many hours of listening pleasure.</td></tr>
