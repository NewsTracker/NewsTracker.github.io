<h3>Greinke's shutout streak on hold for birth of 1st child (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- Zack Greinke's shutout streak is on hold while the Los Angeles Dodgers ace and his wife await the birth of their first child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greinke has pitched 43 2/3 scoreless innings, and was set to start Friday night against the New York Mets at Citi Field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He is approaching the big league record of 59 straight scoreless innings set by Orel Hershiser in 1988 for the Dodgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said before Thursday night's game against the Mets that Greinke had returned to Los Angeles early in the morning to join wife Emily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mattingly received a call in his hotel room at 5 a.m. from Greinke, who caught a flight a couple of hours later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''To get back to pitch tomorrow would be, I'd say unrealistic, but we do feel like there's a good chance he'd pitch this weekend,'' Mattingly said before the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mattingly said after the game left-handed reliever Ian Thomas (0-1) would take Greinke's start Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Mets look like a good matchup for a pitcher chasing a scoreless innings streak record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>New York had scored the second-fewest runs in baseball and had the lowest team batting average entering Thursday night's game against Clayton Kershaw, who pitched a three-hitter in a 3-0 win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Dodgers can fill Greinke's roster spot Friday if necessary and put him on three days' paternity leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The team is off Monday and returns to Los Angeles for a series against Oakland that starts Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greinke leads the majors with a 1.30 ERA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He is 9-2 in 19 starts for the NL West leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mattingly said he has not noticed a drastic difference in how Greinke has pitched this season compared to the right-hander's last two with the Dodgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''Since we've had him, he's been really, really good,'' Mattingly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''This year's just been a little more exceptional than the years before.</td></tr>
