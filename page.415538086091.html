<h3>AP ANALYSIS: Advantage Netanyahu in close race</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A period of some horsetrading looms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With Likud as well as rightist and religious allies, Netanyahu still only commands 57 out of 120 parliament seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He must woo Moshe Kahlon, a relative newcomer to the big leagues of Israeli politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Breaking away from Netanyahu's nationalist Likud two years ago after a falling out with the premier, he adopted a vaguely centrist platform and flirted with Isaac Herzog's more moderate Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If he is non-aligned as he claims, then he holds the balance of power between Israel's traditional right and left blocs, each with just under half of parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is widely thought that it would be too awkward for the former Likud figure to crown the opposition unless Herzog's party enjoyed a cushion of several seats over Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Polls had suggested that would happen, but the actual vote count on Wednesday showed the opposite: Likud was ahead by 30-24 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If Kahlon does go with Netanyahu, it would give the hard-liner a fourth term that, if completed, would make him Israel's longest-serving leader, on par with the nation's founder David Ben Gurion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That would not bode well for prospects of peace with the Palestinians or a rapprochement between Israel and the region, which seems tantalizingly close in an era in which many of the neighboring Arab nations fear jihadi extremism far more than they oppose Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Under Netanyahu, Israel has deepened its hold on the West Bank, adding Jewish settlers to the point where the territory may soon become inseparable from Israel proper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Combined with the Jews in occupied and annexed east Jerusalem, there are some 600,000 Jews living on occupied land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In recent days, Netanyahu has said that he would not allow the creation of a Palestinian state if elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Palestinians have already said they would take their case against Israel to war crimes tribunals and other international bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A campaign to boycott Israel seems poised to gain traction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Netanyahu's relations with the U.S. administration of President Barack Obama are frosty at best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>International isolation looms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Netanyahu knows the complications of all this and may try to draw in Herzog, to give his government a more moderate character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But he has promised, in his final appeals to his base, not to do this " and Herzog would probably demand a rotation in the premier's post as his price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kahlon seems to dislike Netanyahu intensely, and he certainly has the power to crown Herzog, a mild-mannered lawyer and scion of a venerable family of Zionist founders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kahlon's platform is moderate, as are top lieutenants in his party, and despite his Likud roots he has supported the idea of peace talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It is not inconceivable that the left's desire to unseat Netanyahu extends to offering Kahlon a rotation as prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The issue has defined Israeli politics ever since the 1967 Middle East war, which cemented Israel as a regional power but saddled it with occupied territories including the Palestinian-populated West Bank and Gaza Strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, but to many the territory, run by Hamas militants and blockaded on all side by Israel and Egypt, remains part of the equation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Parties on the left would trade the land for peace and allow the creation of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They also argue that the lands are a liability because with their millions of Palestinians their incorporation would destroy Israel as a Jewish-majority state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The right emphasizes the lands' strategic value and biblical symbolism and pushes constantly for settling them with Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Its success in this endeavor has, paradoxically, put the country on a path toward being a place where Jews are no longer a strong majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The issue is Israel's existential dilemma, central to the world's interest and fundamental to determining the country's ultimate character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But after decades of failure and disappointment accompanied by periods of violence, Israelis have despaired of peace and politicians increasingly address the Palestinian matter with evasion, mendacity or doubletalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Zionist Union is a rebranding of Israel's once venerable Labor Party, which led the country for three decades after its founding but last won an election in 1999.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That brought to power its then-leader Ehud Barak, who became the first prime minister to offer the Palestinians a state, on most of the occupied territories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>No deal was struck and a violent Palestinian uprising erupted, leaving Labor in shambles ever since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Meanwhile, the political system has fragmented in ways that align with Israel's internal divisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>So there are parties for Russian immigrants, Sephardic Jews, different types of religious Jews, secular and progressive citizens, the European-oriented middle class, and a new union of Israeli Arab parties that individually are nationalist, Islamic or socialist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Only one thing seems certain: Pressure to overhaul the electoral system that has yielded such chaos will grow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Dan Perry is AP's Middle East editor leading text coverage in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Netanyahu won Israel's election - now what?</td></tr>
