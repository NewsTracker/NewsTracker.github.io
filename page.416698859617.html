<tr><td>13</td><td>Their faces were gaunt, their hair tinted orange, their stomachs distended, all signs of malnutrition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They looked ragged, lost, shattered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the girls were alive and free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They were among a group of 275 children and women rescued from Boko Haram extremists, the first to arrive at a refugee camp Saturday after a three-day journey to safety, brought by Nigeria's military.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>For nearly a year, Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan had been promising to bring home all the people kidnapped by Boko Haram home - especially 219 schoolgirls abducted from their boarding school in the town of Chibok.</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>They lined up for tea, water and a stew of baobab leaves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Some women shot at their rescuers and were killed, as Boko Haram used them as an armed human shield for its main fighting force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Nigerian soldiers were shocked when women opened fire on troops who had come to rescue them in the village of Nbita last week, The Associated Press was told by a military intelligence officer and a soldier who were at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The women killed seven soldiers and 12 of the women were killed, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.</td></tr>

<tr><td>40</td><td>Boko Haram had seized a large swath of northeast Nigeria last year, declaring it an Islamic caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Nigerian troops ran away before their advance, complaining they were not given enough ammunition or food to fight, and leaving civilians with no defense against an uprising that killed as many as 10,000 people last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Some 1.5 million people have been driven from their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The tide turned in the past nine weeks with a new infusion of armory including helicopter gunships, and a coalition with troops from neighboring countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Jonathan on Thursday vowed to "hand over a Nigeria completely free of terrorist strongholds" when he cedes power on May 29.</td></tr>
