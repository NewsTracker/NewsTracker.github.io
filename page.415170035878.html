<h3>Whips, chains and capitalism: what ?Fifty Shades of Grey? is really about</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But this is a romance for a particular kind of age - a time of growing inequality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The social order is breaking up and leaving massive human wreckage in its wake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dreams of love turn into fantasies of power - who has it and what they can do to those who don't have it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When security vanishes and social bonds break down, fictional characters enter the new (ab)normal, which can often involve whips, chains and men in expensive suits with mysterious smiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The film version of the first book of "Fifty Shades" is less a shout against the torment than a whimper - or, to be more precise, a lovesick giggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Other ages with pronounced power inequities have given rise to vivid sadomasochistic fantasies, such as the 18th-century novels of the populist-minded Marquis de Sade, whose tales of pain and bondage resonated during a time when the French propertied classes had their boots firmly on the necks of the proletariat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dreams of transgression become fantasies of liberation from brutal socioeconomic forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Our own age of inequality began in the 1970s, when power-hungry capitalists began to attack the New Deal, which had protected ordinary citizens from predatory elites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On cue, sadomasochism showed up at the box office in 1975 with an adaptation of "The Story of O," in which a woman is trained in sexual submission when she joins the staff of an elite club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In 1980, the year that union-busting U.S. President Ronald Reagan won the White House, viewers channeled sadomasochist revenge fantasies in "Nine to Five," where three working women apply chains and a ball-gag to their tyrannical boss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>By 1986, as financial deregulation unleashed Wall Street, we got " Weeks," which introduced a new stock figure: the vaguely sadistic financier who seduces and abuses a woman of modest means.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More recently, Roman Polanski's 2013 film of David Ives' hit play "Venus in Fur," based on the 19th novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, portrayed a lower-class actress who degrades and dominates an elitist playwright.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Back and forth the stories go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Do you beat the elites (literally) or join them?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In "Fifty Shades," the answer is: Join them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The film is the dispiriting denouement of this late stage of capitalism, where cruel conditions are accepted and you learn to suffer the whims of the rich - and pretend to like it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Under the rules of this cruel regime, the education of sensitive English lit major Anastasia Steele begins when she interviews billionaire Christian Grey in the sumptuous Seattle headquarters of his global empire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>When interviewee queries the ingenue on her plans after college, Anastasia mumbles that she really has no idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After all, what could her literary studies possibly have to do with this sleek glass command center for mysterious market forces, where perfectly coifed, robotic women serve their overlord in stilettos?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When Christian informs Anastasia that his firm has an internship program, she glances around doubtfully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I don't think I'd fit in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Oh, you'll fit in just fine, Christian's faint smile seems to say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She'll fit right in so long as she gives up her autonomy and agrees to a contract in which he is the master and she is the slave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In lieu of an internship, Christian offers her the starring role of sexual submissive to his dominant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The price of admission to the world of the dashing entrepreneur is the willingness to be spanked and cuffed, along with the acceptance of his dictates on everything from what to eat to which gynecologist will inspect Anastasia's genitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In exchange, Christian will arbitrarily dispense various goodies: a new car, couture dresses and private helicopter rides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Exactly 15 women have occupied the position before Anastasia, presumably discarded once the game grew dull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A sensitive English major, it turns out, will make a fine submissive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Notably, Anastasia is a fan of Thomas Hardy, whose 19th-century tale of a peasantry wrecked by industrialization, "Tess of the d'Urbervilles," presents a poor and inexperienced woman who dreams of a better life, for which presumption she is raped by her wealthy libertine employer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Christian will send our young heroine a first edition of the novel as a gift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"There are some people who say I don't have a heart," admits Christian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Because they know me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Yes, we do know Christian - even if Anastasia doesn't quite get it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>We understand by now that in this unwitting parable of the globalized economy, you hand over your life to the one with the money, and he screws you - perhaps even gently at first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>But later, he's sure to break out the cat o' nine tails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>When the prospects of ordinary people grow dim and social mobility declines, dreams begin to alter and diminish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In the 19th-century tales of Jane Austen, characters with restricted possibilities of bettering their situation had to focus on marrying up as the only way out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Today, it looks like we are returning to that paradigm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Anastasia forgoes an internship, which would likely lead to nothing more than a spot on the squad of stilettoed underlings, in favor of winning the hand of the dark prince and turning him from his nasty ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Is it any wonder that this is the fantasy of millions of American women?</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Why wouldn't those shackled by low-paying jobs, bonded to child-rearing with little social support and lacking possibilities for advancement and consumption become seduced by the dream of access to limitless supplies of money and the leisure time in which to explore kinky sex?</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Why would they not want to be carried aloft in helicopters over the drudgery of professional and domestic life?</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>To be distracted by mild titillations in which pain becomes pleasurable and shackles magically liberate?</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Because the "Fifty Shades" trilogy is, at its core, a conventional romance, Cinderella will eventually get to live out the traditional feminine narrative of getting married and having kids with the billionaire-prince.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>(We'll have to wait for two more movie installments for that resolution.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>But this fantasy requires a blindfold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>You have to pretend that the overlord will have a miraculous change of heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>You have to unlearn the rule of late-stage capitalism: Satisfaction is never guaranteed.</td></tr>

<h3>Fierce clashes outside Iraq's Tikrit after new offensive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Backed by Shiite militias and Sunni tribal fighters as well as Iranian advisers, the government forces made little progress on the second day of a large-scale military operation to recapture Tikrit, which fell to the Islamic State group last summer, two local officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraqi troops and Shiite militias battled the Islamic State group on Tuesday on the outskirts of militant-held Tikrit, unable to advance further on Saddam Hussein's hometown as roadside mines and suicide attacks slowed their progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Soldiers found some 100 mines and bombs scattered along an 8-kilometer (5-mile) stretch of road on the way to this strategic city on the Tigris River, Salahuddin deputy governor Ammar Hikmat said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The discovery underlined how the battle likely will pivot on allied Iraqi forces' ability to counter such weapons, a mainstay of al-Qaida in Iraq, the Islamic State group's predecessor, as it fought American forces following their 2003 invasion of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The bombs are "the main obstacle in the way of the attacking forces, which have to wait for bomb experts or to go around the area," Hikmat told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"And this costs time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Extremists from the Islamic State group, which holds both a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate, have littered major roadways and routes with mines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Such mines allow the extremists to slow any ground advance and require painstaking clearing operations before troops can safely move through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Suicide bombings also aid the militants in weakening Iraqi forces and have been used extensively in its failed campaign for the Syrian border town of Kobani.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Already, a militant website affiliated with the Islamic State group has said an American jihadi carried out a suicide attack with a truck bomb on the outskirts of the nearby city of Samarra, targeting Iraqi forces and Shiite militiamen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The posting identified him by the nom de guerre of Abu Dawoud al-Amriki, without elaborating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A suicide bomber also drove a military vehicle Tuesday afternoon into a checkpoint manned by government forces and Shiite fighters south of Tikrit, killing four troops and wounding 12, a police officer and a medical official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tuesday marked the second day of the Iraqi advance on Tikrit, with soldiers supported by Iranian-backed Shiite militias and advisers, along with some Sunni tribal fighters who reject the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hikmat estimated the Iraqi force besieging Tikrit at some 25,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Iran's semi-official Fars news agency has reported that Iranian Gen. Ghasem Soleimani, the commander of the country's elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, was taking part in the offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Government forces, however, made little headway Tuesday, two local officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They said fierce clashes struck mainly outside the town of al-Dour, south of Tikrit, while government troops shelled militant bases inside the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Brig.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Gen. Saad Maan Ibrahim, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said explosive experts had disabled "so many bombs and car bombs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Tikrit has been besieged from three directions, from the north, west and south, but what has remained only from the eastern side," Ibrahim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The explosive experts were able to tackle so many bombs and car bombs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Hikmat said the offensive had killed and wounded "dozens" of Islamic State extremists, but that the attacking forces also have been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Authorities in Baghdad offered no immediate casualty figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Past attempts to retake Tikrit have failed, as Iraq struggles with a military that collapsed last summer during the Islamic State militants' lightning offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Tikrit operation is seen as a litmus test for the capability of Iraqi troops to dislodge the militants from major cities they conquered in the country's Sunni heartland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Retaking Tikrit, the provincial capital of Salahuddin province, some 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Baghdad, would help Iraqi forces secure a major supply link for any future operation to capture Mosul, the country's second-largest city.</td></tr>
