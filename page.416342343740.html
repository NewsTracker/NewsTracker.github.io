<h3>Boko Haram Cameroon attack toll rises to 19, 'many beheaded'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nineteen people were killed in Thursday night's attack on a Cameroonian village by Nigeria-based Boko Haram militants, a security source said in an updated toll, adding that most of the victims were beheaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The final toll from this attack is 19 dead, with a majority of the victims decapitated," a security source said Saturday on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Security sources had previously said 10 civilians were killed in the cross-border raid on the village of Bia in Cameroon's Far North region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attack comes after a regional military offensive -- which includes Cameroon -- has claimed a string of successes in their fightback against the Islamist militants in Nigeria in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bia, which borders Lake Chad, has been identified previously by security forces as a recruiting ground for Boko Haram militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The source speaking to AFP on Saturday said security forces were slow to react to the raid on Bia, located in an area with several military bases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We noted a late response by our forces,", the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Many huts were burned down," the source added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Also during the night from Thursday to Friday, Boko Haram Islamists attacked a Cameroon army position in Amchide, on the border with Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They burned houses in Amchide, but without losses on our side. The attack was repulsed. We don't know yet about casualties on the enemy side," a security source told AFP on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The insurgency by Boko Haram -- which is seeking to create a hardline Islamic state -- has killed some 13,000 people in northeast Nigeria and sent 1.5 million fleeing their homes since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The group had in recent months widened its attacks into neighbouring nations, prompting Chad, Cameroon and Niger to launch a joint offensive with the Nigerian army, resulting in a series of rebel-held towns and villages being recaptured in Nigeria's northeast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's perceived inability to end the six-year insurgency was a factor in his election defeat last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nigerian President-elect Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to rid the country of the "terror" of Boko Haram.</td></tr>
