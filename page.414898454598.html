<h3>World Health Organization approves 1st quick test for Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit, made by Colorado-based Corgenix, met sufficient quality, safety and performance requirements to allow it to be purchased and distributed by U.N. agencies and aid groups, WHO said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It may definitely help the response. I wouldn't say it's a game-changer," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO's assistant director-general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Until now, Ebola tests have been mainly conducted in laboratories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>These gene-based tests are more accurate but can take between 12 and 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new test can provide results within 15 minutes by detecting an Ebola protein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In trials it correctly identified 92 percent of the patients with Ebola and 85 percent of those not infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Medical personnel will still need to conduct a backup test when someone tests negative, said Aylward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"But (the new test) might help us get to zero faster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Almost 24,000 people have been infected and nearly 9,400 people have died from the current Ebola outbreak, which began in West Africa over a year ago.</td></tr>

<h3>Kanye West blasts ex Amber Rose amid model's Kardashian feud</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 37-year-old rapper appeared on Power 105.1's Breakfast Club Friday morning and responded to his ex-girlfriend, Amber Rose, slamming the Kardashians on the same show last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I had to take 30 showers before I got with Kim," the outspoken star quipped about the extreme measures taken to be with Kardashian following his two-year relationship with Rose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"If Kim had dated me when I first wanted to be with her, there would be no Amber Rose."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"She's just soaking in the moment," West added of his former flame talking about the reality star family in interviews to make headlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that's with Amber Rose so she wasn't sending nothing," he said denying claims that the 34-year-old brunette beauty was sending him pictures while he was still dating Rose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I'm sorry, don't ask me no more I just want to be respectful," West pleaded with the hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Following his comments, Rose took to Twitter to voice her own opinions on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"@Kanyewest after all these year I never snitched on u and I don't plan on starting now. We once loved each other so I won't do u like that," she tweeted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'll leave that up to the Kartrashians to humiliate u when they're done with you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I'm always so quiet and just a cool fun girl. The funny thing is I'm all for a woman making something out of nothing," she adds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Ppl make mistakes in life trust me I have. But when u bully other ppl and ur not perfect its so f---ed. I own up to every piece of my life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The recent Rose/Kardashian beef escalated when the 31-year-old model blasted Tyga, who is the ex of her pal Blac Chyna, on the radio show for dating West's 17-year-old sister-in-law Kylie Jenner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"She's a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o'clock and relax," Rose said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"That's ridiculous. (Tyga) should be ashamed of himself. For sure. He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Khloe Kardashian jumped to her little sister's defense via Twitter by reminding her over 12 million followers that Rose was a stripper in her younger years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I was a stripper since I was 15 years old," Amber Rose told Foxx.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Please don't worry about my sister who has a career & her s-t," Khloe tweeted.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>Rose quickly responded, igniting a social media feud, and she didn't hesitate to drag Kim into it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I'll be that lil whore to support my family like ur older sister is a whore 2 support hers. We're even," she said ahead of firing out a series of slams against the famous sisters.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>Even though the 25-year-old rapper denied he was romantically involved with the teen starlet, West praised him for getting in with Jenner "early."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I think he was smart. They are closer in age than a lot of relationships I know," West noted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I knew Tyga was smart. I can't speak on a man's relationship."</td></tr>
