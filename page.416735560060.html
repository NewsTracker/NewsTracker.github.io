<h3>Israeli foreign minister steps down to join opposition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's foreign minister dealt a blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's effort to build a coalition by announcing Monday he is stepping down and that his secular, nationalist party is joining the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Avigdor Lieberman said he could not sit in the government after Netanyahu struck a series of deals with ultra-Orthodox partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu has been trying to cobble together a majority coalition in the 120-seat parliament by a Wednesday deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lieberman has served two terms as foreign minister and has been a key Netanyahu ally throughout the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Our dilemma was between principles or seats, I am happy that we decided to keep our principles and give up our seats," Lieberman told his Yisrael Beitenu party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I have decided to resign from my post as foreign minister."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Lieberman's once-powerful party plummeted in the March election to just six seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Without Yisrael Beitenu, Netanyahu is expected to have a slim majority of just 61 seats, leaving him susceptible to the demands of partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last week, Netanyahu signed up his first two partners, the center-right Kulanu party, led by influential newcomer Moshe Kahlon, and the ultra-Orthodox party United Torah Judaism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The deal with the latter party reportedly includes concessions for those avoiding the country's military draft for religious reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu is also expected to team up with Shas, another ultra-Orthodox party, and the nationalist Jewish Home party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It was not immediately clear who will replace Lieberman as foreign minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lieberman, who once worked as a bar bouncer, immigrated to Israel in 1978 from Moldova in the former Soviet Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He became a national figure in 1996 as a top aide to Netanyahu during his previous term as prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He later quit Netanyahu's Likud party and was elected to parliament in 1999 as head of Yisrael Beitenu, a secular hawkish party he established to represent the more than 1 million immigrants from the former Soviet Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Lieberman is known for his inflammatory rhetoric that has at times agitated his partners in government.</td></tr>
