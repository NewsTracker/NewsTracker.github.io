<h3>Astros rough up King Felix in 10-0 win over Seattle (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros cast aside their recent offensive woes with an unlikely outburst against one of the game's best pitchers Friday night to snap a season-high, seven-game skid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Luis Valbuena and Jason Castro homered as the Astros chased Felix Hernandez during an eight-run first inning on the way to a 10-0 win over the Seattle Mariners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Astros had managed more than two runs just once during their losing streak before jumping on Hernandez for more runs than they'd scored in the last three games combined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''Probably one of our best innings of the year,'' manager A.J. Hinch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It had been built up over the last week or so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Carlos Correa and Chris Carter also went deep for the Astros, but All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve left early with discomfort in his right hamstring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hinch said the team doesn't think the injury is serious, but Altuve will be out of the lineup on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hernandez (9-3), who had allowed just seven runs on the road all season, was tagged for five hits and eight runs with two walks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He got only one out, tying the shortest start of his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''I don't know what happened,'' a stone-faced Hernandez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Brett Oberholtzer (1-1) allowed three hits in eight sharp innings and Joe Thatcher completed the four-hitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was Oberholtzer's fourth start of the season after missing much of the year because of two stints on the disabled list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Seattle became the first team since the Montreal Expos in April 2004 to score three runs or fewer 15 times in a 16-game span, according to STATS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Astros were up by three before a three-run shot by Valbuena, and Castro added a two-run homer two batters later to make it 8-0 and end King Felix's night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''They just kept getting hits,'' Hernandez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''The home run from Castro was unreal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Correa, a highly touted rookie making his home debut, was the only out Hernandez got before his early exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But the top pick in the 2012 draft added a solo homer in the second, and Carter pushed the lead to double digits with his soaring shot in the fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The abbreviated start by Hernandez forced the Mariners to use four relievers before going to catcher Jesus Sucre for the eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Sucre was effective, allowing one hit in a scoreless inning in his first major league pitching appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Manager Lloyd McClendon said he used Sucre to keep from further taxing a bullpen that had to pitch 5 2-3 innings on Thursday before Friday's fiasco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Altuve got the big inning going with a leadoff single before Preston Tucker walked on four pitches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>George Springer's double down the right-field line made it 1-0 before things really started falling apart for Hernandez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Evan Gattis hit a one-hopper to Hernandez on the next pitch, and the right-hander threw home to try and stop Tucker from scoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Instead, Hernandez threw it in the dirt and the ball bounced off catcher Mike Zunino's leg for an error that allowed two runs to score and Gattis to reach second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Hernandez shook his fist and cursed at himself after the ball rolled away and the runners crossed the plate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>After a short mound visit, Hernandez walked Colby Rasmus before striking out Correa for the first out of the inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But then Valbuena snapped an 0-for-19 slump by sending an 88 mph changeup into the bullpen in right-center to extend the lead to 6-0 and leave the 2010 AL Cy Young Award winner shaking his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''Blink of an eye, it was 6-0,'' Hernandez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Carter singled before Castro launched a homer to the Crawford Boxes in left field to make it 8-0 and end Hernandez's night just 31 pitches after it began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He looked bewildered as he watched Castro's drive and mumbled to himself before covering his mouth with his glove as he slowly walked to the dugout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The other time Hernandez left after getting just one out came on April 18, 2007, when he was pulled because of an injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>It was the most runs he had allowed since giving up nine - eight earned - on Aug. 28, 2013, against Texas and just two away from his career high of 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Hernandez was great in the first two months of the season and had an ERA of 1.91 entering June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But he's struggled in two of his three starts this month to push it to 3.38.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Houston's eight runs were the most the team has scored in an inning since also scoring eight on Aug. 12, 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Correa had a large contingent of family and friends at the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>They all wore T-shirts with his name and number on them and waved the flag of his native Puerto Rico when he homered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He received a standing ovation from the home crowd before his first at-bat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''It was a shocking moment for me,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>''It's something that I will never forget when I step to the plate and they just start cheering for me and screaming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Mariners: All-Star RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (tightness in upper back) is scheduled to throw a simulated game Monday and if that goes well he could go on a rehabilitation assignment next weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Astros: RHP Samuel Deduno (right hip) is expected to throw live batting practice in the next few days and then go on a rehab assignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Seattle rookie left-hander Mike Montgomery opposes Collin McHugh when the series continues Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Montgomery has a 2.08 ERA but is looking for his first win in his third career start.</td></tr>
