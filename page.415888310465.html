<h3>Euro posts record quarterly drop; Wall St ends day lower</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - The euro closed out the worst quarter in its 15-year history on Tuesday, slammed by monetary policy changes and worries about Greece, while U.S. stocks retreated a day after posting big gains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq registered their ninth straight quarterly gains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The euro skidded 11 percent against the dollar in the first quarter reflecting investors' expectations of divergent monetary policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Investors are betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year, while the European Central Bank's one-trillion-euro economic stimulus program is weakening the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The euro on Tuesday was down 0.8 percent against the dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The greenback marked its biggest quarterly rise against the world's top six currencies since 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Wall Street, energy shares were among the biggest drags, falling in tandem with a decline in crude oil prices, offsetting a lift from two days of corporate takeover announcements, including several biotech deals on Monday and Charter Communications' plan to buy Bright House Networks for roughly $10 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 200.19 points, or 1.11 percent, to 17,776.12, the S&P 500 lost 18.35 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,067.89, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 46.56 points, or 0.94 percent, to 4,900.88.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Today's price action is reflection of all the bad in the quarter - the stronger dollar, weaker oil - and in some respects just a snapback from yesterday's outsized gains," said John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial in Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Tomorrow's a new quarter and there's a new batch of people ready to take some risks, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see an up day," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The benchmark S&P 500's quarterly winning streak was its longest since 1998 while the Nasdaq's was its longest ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Dow fell slightly for the quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But all three indexes declined for the month of March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>U.S. Treasury debt prices rose, getting a lift from buying by institutional investors preparing their portfolios for the end of the quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 7/32 in price, with the yield at 1.9353 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed off 0.7 percent as traders squared up for the quarter end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Greece's debt negotiations have made investors uneasy on both sides of the Atlantic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday that Athens had a certain degree of flexibility on which reforms to implement but stressed that they must "add up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Greece's leader, Alexis Tsipras, responded by appealing for an "honest compromise" but warned he would not agree to unconditional demands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Oil took a slide on prospects that OPEC member Iran could reach a deal on its nuclear program that could allow Tehran to sell more of its oil onto an already saturated market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>U.S. crude settled down 2.2 percent at $47.60 per barrel while Brent fell 2 percent to $55.11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Brent crude tumbled 12 percent for the month of March.</td></tr>
