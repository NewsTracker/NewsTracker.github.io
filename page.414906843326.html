<h3>White House seeks to blunt Netanyahu address to Congress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The White House is mulling ways to undercut Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming trip to Washington and blunt his message that a potential nuclear deal with Iran is bad for Israel and the world in what has become a nasty grudge match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Administration officials have discarded the idea of President Barack Obama himself giving an Iran-related address to rebut the two speeches Netanyahu is to deliver during his early March visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But options remain on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The administration has already ruled out meetings between Netanyahu and Obama, saying it would be inappropriate for the two to meet so close to Israel's March 17 elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, the White House is now doubling down on a cold-shoulder strategy, including dispatching cabinet members out of the country and sending a lower-ranking official than normal to represent the administration at the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Vice President Joe Biden will be away, his absence behind Netanyahu conspicuous in coverage of the speech to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Other options were described by officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Netanyahu's plan for a March 3 address to a joint meeting of Congress has further strained already tense ties between the United States and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Congressional Republicans orchestrated Netanyahu's visit without consulting the White House or State Department, a move the Obama administration blasted as a break in diplomatic protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some Democratic lawmakers say they will boycott the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>U.S. officials believe Netanyahu's trip to Washington is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, Obama's signature foreign policy objective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While Netanyahu has long been skeptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions he says would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His opposition has intensified as negotiations go into overdrive with an end-of-March deadline for a framework deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I think this is a bad agreement that is dangerous for the state of Israel, and not just for it," Netanyahu said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The difference of opinion over the deal has become unusually rancorous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The White House and State Department have both publicly accused Israeli officials of leaking "cherry-picked" details of the negotiations to try to discredit the administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And, in extraordinary admissions this week, the administration acknowledged the U.S. is withholding sensitive details of the talks from Israel, its main Middle East ally, to prevent such leaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The rebukes have only emboldened the leader of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He has a double-barrelled attack on the Iran talks ready for when he arrives in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Besides adressing Congress, he will also deliver similar remarks at the AIPAC conference, an event to which administrations past and present have traditionally sent top foreign policy officials - but maybe not this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>An AIPAC official said Friday that the group has not yet received any reply to its invitation for senior administration figures to attend the meeting that starts March 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The official stressed that last-minute RSVPs are not unusual, but the White House has been signalling for some time that a cabinet-level guest may not coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Instead, the administration is toying with the idea of sending Antony Blinken, the newly installed deputy secretary of state, to speak to the conference, according to officials familiar with internal discussions on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But it's possible Treasury Secretary Jack Lew could attend.</td></tr>

<h3>Aaron Hernandez jurors see video of victim getting into car</h3>

<tr><td>2</td><td>FALL RIVER, Mass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) - Grainy surveillance video shown Friday to jurors in the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez shows the victim an hour before he was killed climbing into a car that prosecutors say was driven by Hernandez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hernandez is charged in the June 17, 2013, shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A neighbor who lived across the street from Lloyd in the Dorchester section of Boston captured the video on three surveillance cameras on his property early that morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the video, Lloyd is seen around 2:30 a.m. walking up and down the sidewalk outside his home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At 2:32 a.m., a sedan pulls up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He enters the rear passenger side, and it drives away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prosecutors have said Hernandez was driving a Nissan Altima he had rented, accompanied by acquaintances Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both men are also charged in the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They will be tried separately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At 2:53 a.m., the Altima was photographed driving through a toll plaza on the Massachusetts Turnpike without paying, according to testimony Friday by Rocky D'Angelo, who works at the company that manages electronic toll collection for Massachusetts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Prosecutors showed a photograph of the car's license plate as it drove through the toll plaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prosecutors have said the men then drove to an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, where Lloyd was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>His body was found later that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Also Friday, the judge and prosecutor got into a heated argument over text messages sent by Lloyd to his sister in the minutes before he was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh previously ruled them inadmissible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In one, Lloyd told his sister, Shaquilla Thibou, he was with "NFL."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After prosecutor William McCauley called Thibou to the stand, Hernandez's defense team asked the judge for a sidebar before she was seated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After a brief conversation, she ordered a recess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But McCauley became exercised and told Garsh he would not agree to that, and said he wanted jurors to hear that four text messages were sent, at 3:07 a.m., 3:11 a.m., 3:22 a.m. and 3:23 a.m. He said the messages indicate Lloyd was alive and his location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The judge said he couldn't ask Lloyd's sister about texts at all, prompting McCauley to push again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I have made a ruling. My ruling stands!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Garsh replied angrily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>McCauley indicated he might appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He chose not to call Lloyd's sister to the stand.</td></tr>
