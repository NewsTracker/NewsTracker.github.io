<h3>Migrants Hope to Re-Start Protest Convoy in Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For several years, migrants have carried wooden crosses in protest marches in Mexico around Easter week to illustrate their suffering at the hands of criminals and corrupt police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The convoy of buses carrying the migrants had planned to leave Thursday from the city of Ixtepec, in southern Oaxaca state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Alejandro Solalinde, who runs a shelter for migrants in Ixtepec, said authorities threatened to arrest on human-trafficking charges the owners of buses rented to carry the protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Solalinde's shelter said the migrants now plan to set out on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And Amnesty International called on Mexican authorities to guarantee security for the migrants on the Wednesday trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mexico's immigration agency said Monday it was respecting the migrants' rights, and that its nearest checkpoint was 5.5 kms (3 miles) from the shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Migrant rights activists had complained the checkpoints basically had the migrants - a total of over 400 at the shelter - surrounded and intimidated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mexico's National Immigration Institute has said its agents are unarmed and human rights observers are present in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The protesters are calling for an end to immigration raids that have largely prevented them from the riding a freight train north toward the U.S. border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Solalinde said raids begun last summer to stop hitchhiking on the train had forced migrants to use more dangerous routes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said that while about 15 percent of migrants were victims of robbery, extortion, assault and other forms of abuse previously, about 90 percent are victimized now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Before, they could get through faster and look after each other" on the train, Solalinde said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Before, a stretch that would take them 12 or 13 hours, now it takes them a month. They are taking a dozen longer, more dangerous routes, where they are robbed or extorted."</td></tr>
