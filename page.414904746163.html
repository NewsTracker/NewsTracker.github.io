<h3>Artist: Sculpture of Oscar on cocaine spotlights showbiz drug culture</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But the industry's drug users received a "tribute" with an Oscar of their own, and a few days early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Plastic Jesus, who has never divulged his real name in interviews, said the display was placed at La Brea Avenue in Hollywood, at the edge of where the street will be cordoned off during the Oscar ceremony at the Dolby Theatre on Sunday -- and was meant to draw awareness to rampant drug use in the film industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We are deluded if we are saying that cocaine isn't a major part of Hollywood and almost every other city in the world," the artist told The New York Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"A lot of people will sit down and watch the Oscar show this Sunday and then go and indulge in cocaine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The piece is intended to draw attention to Hollywood's hidden problem of drug addiction that effects hundreds of people in the showbiz industry and is largely ignored until the death of a high-profile A-list celebrity," photographer Nick Stern, who works with Plastic Jesus, told website LAist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Daily News reported that the display had been removed only a few hours after it appeared -- because apparently, Plastic Jesus said, a "grouchy, old man started ranting about it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It doesn't sound like the artwork will reappear on Hollywood Boulevard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Plastic Jesus said, "People have posted it. It got enough publicity to get people to think."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, the artist said he plans to display it on Melrose Avenue on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>You could call "Hollywood's Best Party" a sequel of sorts to "Hollywood's Best Kept Secret" -- a similar piece the artist created for the event last year: An Oscar statuette with a belt cinched around its left arm and a heroin needle firmly implanted, which appeared shortly after the drug-related death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This year's piece took Plastic Jesus three weeks to create.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The statue is composed of fiberglass and the faux cocaine of crushed aspirin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The artist said the statue isn't meant to depict any celebrity in particular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The piece is really just to show how much a part of everyday life for people cocaine is," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In the current war on drugs, this isn't working. The term controlled substance is an absolute joke. There is absolutely no control."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 87th Academy Awards will be presented Sunday at 7 p.m. EST (4 p.m. PST) and be broadcast live by ABC.</td></tr>

<h3>Liberia to end Ebola curfew, open land border crossings</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The new orders from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, which take effect Sunday, offer another sign that normal life is resuming in the West African nation as officials work toward eradicating the disease entirely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Once the center of the worst Ebola outbreak in history, Liberia has recorded more than 9,000 confirmed, suspected and probable cases and 3,900 deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, the most recent update from the World Health Organization reported only two cases in the previous week, and schools began reopening earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Friday's statement said Sirleaf made her decision about the curfew and borders "on the advice of the National Security Council of Liberia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The curfew was imposed last August when the epidemic was raging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It originally lasted from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., though officials later pushed the start time back to midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The statement said Sirleaf had ordered that "the country's main borders" be opened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That includes the borders with Sierra Leone and Guinea, but it wasn't immediately clear if the border with Ivory Coast would be reopened, because Ivory Coast closed its borders in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sierra Leone recorded 74 new cases in the latest WHO update and transmission remains widespread there, while Guinea recorded 52 cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sirleaf's announcement comes as she prepares to visit the White House next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a statement, the White House said President Barack Obama and Sirleaf would discuss the current Ebola response and the region's economic recovery plans during their Feb. 27 meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The United States is preparing to withdraw most of the nearly 3,000 troops dispatched to West Africa last year to help combat the outbreak.</td></tr>
