<h3>After Congress speech on Iran, Netanyahu's prospects could hinge on White House response</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Which way it goes for Netanyahu may hinge on whether Israel is in some perceptible way punished by the White House for its leader's extraordinary offensive against a U.S. president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>If he is seen as having bravely spoken truth to power and escaped consequences, the episode will likely help him at the polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That could deeply affect the Middle East for years to come on issues far beyond Iran, most notably the conflict with the Palestinians, which some consider even more important than the nature of any future deal on Iran's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At home and abroad, Netanyahu is seen by many as a leading obstacle to peace with the Palestinians and perhaps the Arab world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And his insistence on continuing Jewish settlement of the occupied West Bank has many fearing Israel will never be able to extricate itself from the territory and its millions of Palestinians - with or without peace - destroying its character as a Jewish state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For this and other reasons, Netanyahu has found himself at increasingly toxic loggerheads with the country's elites - from the security establishment to academics, journalists, cultural figures and much of the business world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This has been recently compounded by scandals involving his expenses, and rage from middle-class Israelis who struggle to make ends meet and can no longer afford to buy homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Polls show Netanyahu's Likud party slightly trailing the Zionist Union, which is the main grouping of the center-left opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the highly fractured political environment, it seems plausible that the union's head, Isaac Herzog, may be given a first chance to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat Knesset after the March 17 vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Under these circumstances, while Netanyahu's speech was delivered to the U.S. Congress, his primary audience may well have been Israel's voters half a world away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a comedy show that aired just before the speech, a mock Netanyahu was portrayed filling out U.S. immigration forms on the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under "reason for visit" he declared: "one or two seats" in parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The images of Netanyahu mingling with congressional leaders and receiving standing ovations may achieve just that, or even better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Netanyahu made no mention of the election - but he deftly touched on Israeli fears and emotions with a litany of talking points that form the core of his political playbook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He condemned Iran as dangerously hostile, with tentacles stretching across the Middle East - and managed to connect it to this week's Jewish holiday of Purim, in which ancient Jews defeated a Persian enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He presented Israel as peace-loving and progressive and stressed its deep bonds to the U.S. He even produced Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who waved as Netanyahu intoned "Never Again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Even opponents acknowledged the masterful political theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There is no doubt that Prime Minister Netanyahu knows how to speak," said Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But it was risky: Netanyahu's references to an emerging "bad deal" undermined a centerpiece of the U.S. administration's foreign policy and challenged its insistence that no deal has yet been struck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The event was engineered by the Republican House speaker, John Boehner, and Netanyahu's ambassador to Washington, U.S.-born Ron Dermer, who once worked as a Republican operative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The White House made no secret about its unhappiness, making sure Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden were not present and refusing to meet the Israeli leader while he was in town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Dozens of congressional Democrats, caught between support for Israel and loyalty to the president, skipped the address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some who attended gave it a cool response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, said she was "near tears" and "saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But the mood in Netanyahu's entourage was upbeat afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In a statement released after he landed back in Israel on Wednesday, Netanyahu said his speech to Congress offered a "practical alternative" to a possible Iranian nuclear deal and that U.S. lawmakers now "understand better" why the deal is bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Hebrew University, said that to an Israeli audience Netanyahu's speech was "so exciting, so powerful" that "it will definitely help him in the campaign."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Diskin noted, though, that the remaining two weeks are a long time in Israeli politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Israel's media on Wednesday reflected that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Many praised the form, such as Meir Uziel, who gushed in the Maariv daily that "the speech was artistry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But there was also a strong sense that Netanyahu had upset Obama for little practical gain on Iran, using the august foreign setting for an electoral maneuver that Sima Kadmon, writing in Yediot Ahronot, called "the most ornate (political) survival speech ever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Much now depends on the White House response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Although Obama is somewhat unpopular in Israel, if Netanyahu is perceived as having truly unsettled relations with the U.S., it could boomerang.</td></tr>
