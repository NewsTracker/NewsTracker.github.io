<h3>Iran to appoint first female ambassador since Islamic Revolution: reports</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DUBAI - Iran will appoint its first female ambassador abroad since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the semi-official Fars and Mehr news agencies said late on Monday, citing unspecified reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The post would go to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham, one of Iran's most high-profile female public figures, although it was not clear where she would be sent, the agencies said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This would make Afkham the second female ambassador in the history of Iran and the first since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The only other female ambassador was Mehrangiz Dolatshahi, who served in Denmark in the 1970s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Human rights groups frequently criticize Iran's record on women's rights, including a high rate of domestic violence and girls forced into marriages at ages as young as 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>President Hasan Rowhani promised to improve women's rights as part of his election campaign in 2013, but progress on domestic reform has been slow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appointed the Islamic Republic's first female minister in 2009.</td></tr>
