<h3>Community hospitals say Jindal budget would cut funding</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - Private hospitals said Wednesday that Gov. Bobby Jindal's budget proposal would shutter a program that cares for sickly babies and cut money they are paid for emergency room care for Medicaid patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Louisiana Hospital Association said those $25 million in cuts are included in Jindal's spending recommendations for the fiscal year that begins July 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Jindal administration described its budget as containing no reductions to the rates hospitals are paid for taking care of Medicaid patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But hospital association president Paul Salles disagreed after taking a deeper dive into the numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We heard during the budget presentation there were no rate cuts to hospitals, and on further examination there are rate and funding cuts to hospitals," Salles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Targeted for elimination by Jindal is a program that pays hospitals for the care of premature, low-birth-weight babies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The governor also proposes to pay a lower reimbursement rate for Medicaid patients who go to emergency rooms with nonemergency medical needs - a proposal that lawmakers rejected from the Jindal administration last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>State Health and Hospitals Secretary Kathy Kliebert defended the governor's plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our responsibility as we build the budget is to look at the big picture of all programs and make sure we're keeping critical services intact," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kliebert said she will continue negotiating with the hospitals, describing the proposals as "efficiencies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But she acknowledged that reshuffling without additional money would just move cuts elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In addition to the $25 million in cuts, Salles said the hospital association was concerned that Jindal's budget included millions of dollars less than what private operators of the state-owned hospitals said they need to provide care for the poor and uninsured next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Also a worry, Salles said, is that $368 million that would flow to hospital programs next year is tied to Jindal's proposal to scale back spending on certain tax-credit programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The proposal has run into sharp criticism from business lobbying groups and is not guaranteed to win legislative approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Lawmakers will craft a final version of next year's budget in the legislative session that begins April 13, using Jindal's proposal as a starting point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The budget was just introduced and this is the beginning of the process. We are working with hospitals on a solution," said Meghan Parrish, spokeswoman for Jindal's Division of Administration.</td></tr>
