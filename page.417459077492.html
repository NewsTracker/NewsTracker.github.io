<h3>Paris meeting on Islamic State: Australia to seek clarification on fall of Ramadi</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop will use a top-level meeting in Paris and surrounding bilaterals in an attempt to include Iran at the highest level in the coalition against IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Paris: The "will to fight" of the Iraqi army, critical to the battle against the Islamic State, was to be a major topic of discussion at top-level talks including Australia in Paris overnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fairfax Media understands that recent setbacks including the fall of Ramadi will be discussed at the meeting of the global coalition against IS, and countries including Australia will seek clarification from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on how and why the city fell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>US Defence Secretary Ash Carter recently complained that Iraqi forces lacked the "will to fight".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Australia will also use the meeting and surrounding bilaterals to attempt to build consensus that Iran should be a part of the coalition at the highest level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was expected to argue that including Iran would have practical and strategic benefit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It would enable better co-ordination in actions against IS between coalition air strikes and the Iraqi security forces and Shiite militia on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Iran is already practically involved in the fight in Iraq, through its influence on and support for local Shiite militia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Iran openly boasts that Baghdad would have fallen without its efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Australia also believes involving Iran in the coalition against IS would help repair diplomatic damage done more than a decade ago by George Bush jnr's "Axis of evil" speech the year after the attacks on the US on September 11, 2001, which still angers Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The topic was repeatedly brought up by Iranian officials on Ms Bishop's recent visit to Tehran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ms Bishop flew to Paris to attend the meeting, the second at the ministerial level since the coalition was agreed at the NATO meeting in Cardiff last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ministers will also be briefed by UNESCO on the damage done by IS to antiquities in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is believed the raids are not only being used for propaganda but also as a source of black-market revenue to fund the fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The meeting will also cover strategies to prevent foreign fighters reaching IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>However the Australian government believes that a key to stopping the flow of fighters into the region would be a decisive, demoralising victory in a significant battle in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The fall of Ramadi, the capital of the Sunni Anbar province, in May was a political disaster for the US, which may now face pressure to reverse its decision not to send its soldiers to "accompany" Iraqi troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On Tuesday, retired Australian army general Jim Molan, who has significant sway within the Abbott government, called for Australian and allied troops to deepen their involvement in Iraq by entering the battlefield to prop up shaky local forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry had been due to attend the Paris meeting, but had to withdraw after breaking his leg falling off his bicycle in the French Alps on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>However Ms Bishop will have a bilateral meeting with his deputy, Antony Blinken, and General John Allen, the US' special presidential envoy to the coalition against IS.</td></tr>
