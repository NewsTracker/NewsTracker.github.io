<h3>Salt Lake City will soon offer Google's high-speed Internet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Salt Lake City will soon join a handful of U.S. cities in offering high-speed internet service through Google Fiber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google Fiber spokesman Devin Baer said the company plans to start construction for the network after several months of planning with city officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said they don't yet have a definitive pricing structure, but expect to offer service similar to what currently exists in another Utah city, Provo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google offers three levels of service to customers who pay the $30 activation fee in Provo, one of the first cities selected for the project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Residents there can chose a free 5 megabit connection, a high-speed 1 gigabit connection for $70 per months or the high speed connection plus TV service for $120 per month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google Fiber will not provide the number of households connected to its service, but said Baer said things in Provo have been "really great."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Earlier this year, the company announced that it will soon introduce its service for small businesses in Provo, which is about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Baer said he hopes to bring the small business option to Salt Lake City as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Google chose Salt Lake City because it has a "thriving tech community" and is a natural extension from Provo, he said.</td></tr>
