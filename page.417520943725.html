<h3>4-way tie at Memorial as Woods struggles to stay in game (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Tiger Woods stuck with a swing that wasn't working and settled into a long week at the Memorial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Woods had to scramble on the front nine to salvage a 1-over 73 in the opening round Thursday at Muirfield Village, a strong fight and reasonable score though still nowhere near the four-way tie for the lead among the early starters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Harris English, Ryan Moore, Ken Duke and Brendon Todd each had a 67.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The large group at 68 included Jordan Spieth, who saved the start of his round with a world-class short game and then made one big mistake that turned a birdie into a bogey late in his round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Woods, playing for only the second time since his return at the Masters, was all over the course where he has won five times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He made bogey on his opening hole of a PGA Tour event for the eighth time in his past nine events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He blocked a tee shot so far right on the 18th that it went out of bounds, and then hit a duck-hook with a 3-wood on the first hole and scrambled for par.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Woods, at age 39, is making more changes to his swing and was sticking to them regardless of the scores on his card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I was just trying to stay committed to what we're working on, to what we're doing,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''I hit it awful, yeah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So what?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I was going to go through this phase and stick with it, keep sticking with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And some of the shots I hit were really, really good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But then I also had some really bad shots, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>With an overcast sky, relatively soft conditions and not much wind, Muirfield Village was ripe for good scoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>English, at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>70 in the world and in dire need of a big week to avoid U.S. Open qualifying on Monday, bogeyed two of his opening three holes and that was the end of his mistakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He ran off three straight birdies on the back nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Moore did his damage early with a hybrid into 5 feet for eagle on the par-5 fifth hole, followed by a pair of birdies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Duke and Todd each plodded their way around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>No one went too low, but plenty were right there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Francesco Molinari, Keegan Bradley and Justin Rose joined Spieth in the group at 68.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Justin Thomas and Patrick Rodgers, roommates in south Florida and this week (along with Spieth), were in the group at 69.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Rodgers was at Muirfield Village last year to accept the Jack Nicklaus Award as the best player in college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Now he's playing and has a reasonable chance of doing well enough to earn unlimited exemptions the rest of the year in a bid to earn his card next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Woods grabbed the most attention for two reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He's Tiger Woods, still enough to attract the biggest gallery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>And there remains a mystery about the game of a 79-time PGA Tour winner who has plunged to No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>172 in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Woods has worked with Chris Como since last November, and said they implemented more changes since The Players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Most intriguing about his assessment of Thursday's round was a stubbornness to see the changes to a conclusion, no matter how long that takes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Como is the fourth instructor he has used as a pro, and this would be his fifth swing change (two under Butch Harmon).</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Previous changes have taken as long as 18 months for Woods to figure it out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Time is no longer on his side, however, not at his age and with five surgeries behind him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''I've gone through phases like this, rounds like this, where yeah, it's easy to revert back and go ahead and hit some old pattern,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''But it doesn't do you any good going forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>And I've done it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Sometimes it's taken me about a year and then it kicked in and I did pretty good after that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>... If you believe in it, do it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>And eventually it will start turning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The competition has never been stronger, starting with the 21-year-old Spieth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The Masters champion salvaged his round early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He didn't hit a fairway or a green until his fifth hole, yet he saved par each time, including a tough wedge with his back against a tree from 50 yards out to 7 feet to save par.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>He was tied for the lead when he played hybrid for his second shot to the par-5 seventh, even though he felt the wind shift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Spieth misplayed a tough wedge into a bunker and wound up making bogey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>''Kind of a tough finish to swallow after such a great round of golf,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Woods could have been a lot worse off except for a bogey-free front nine with three birdies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>It was hard work for one day, not to lead but to hang on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>''Physically, I feel good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Mentally, I feel beat up,'' Woods said.</td></tr>
