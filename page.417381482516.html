<h3>Dark Knight gunman James Holmes said he hoped FBI would STOP him before Colorado theater massacre</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dark Knight gunman James Holmes thought the FBI was watching him before he opened fire on a packed movie theater in 2012 - and hoped he would get caught before killing anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Holmes, 27, made the confession to a psychiatrist who interviewed him after he had been arrested for killing 12 people an injuring 70 others at the screening of a Batman movie in Aurora, Colorado.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The killer, who has pleaded insanity in a bid to escape the death penalty, said that even as he was meticulously planning his attack to ensure maximum slaughter, he wanted to be arrested by authorities before he had the chance to pull the trigger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'Wanted to be stopped': James Holmes, 27, told a psychiatrist that he wanted the FBI to capture him before he was able to massacre 12 people in a movie theater shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jurors in his death penalty trial were played the video, recorded last year, in court on Friday as they wrangle with the question of whether Holmes was legally insane at the time of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They also watched him claim that he was enervated in the run-up to the attack because he had contracted fatigue-causing disease mononucleosis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He also said he was down after breaking up with a girlfriend in early 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the video a taciturn Holmes told Dr William Read, a state-appointed psychiatrist, that he hoped he would be 'locked away before I did it'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Reid has previously said that he is sure Holmes was legally sane when he carried out the massacre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Holmes told Dr. William Reid about his persistent violent thoughts, including a feeling that he should shoot as many people as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under Colorado law it is up to the prosecution to prove that he was sane, and therefore eligible for death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They say a possible motive was anger and frustration over his struggles to work and communicate with other researchers a competitive neuroscience program at the University of Colorado.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Holmes himself said that his 'mind was kind of falling apart' and that he was having homicidal thoughts months before the July 2012 attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The clip is part of a 22-hour video interview of Holmes' state-ordered evaluation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Aftermath: Police are pictured responding to the shooting on July 20, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On screen, Holmes appeared cautious, even wary, his hands clasped as he answered with few words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In court, Holmes did not glance at the video screen but stared straight ahead, swiveling lightly in his chair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Reid did the vast majority of talking in the video clip, apparently trying to get Holmes to open up as he asked the defendant about a wide range of topics, including faith, his parents, his preference for being alone, books he liked and childhood nightmares.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Holmes said faith was important to his mother but that he was 'never really a believer.' Asked about his parents' relationship, he said he 'could see love between them' and that he also felt loved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said he suffered nightmares as a child and sometimes experienced a catatonic state, a 'frozen feeling.' He preferred to live alone in an apartment at college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Why, why why?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Above is an excerpt from James Holmes's diary, which was filed as evidence in his trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This week, prosecutors presented a notebook in which Holmes methodically weighed pros and cons of a theater attack and included notes on his mental condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Holmes wrote about how he liked to keep his distance from psychiatrists and therapists who treated him: 'Prevent building false sense of rapport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Speak truthfully and deflect incriminating questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Judge Carlos Samour told the jury they should consider what they see and hear in the interviews only for the purpose of determining the issue of Holmes' sanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Reid has acknowledged that between the attack and his interview, Holmes suffered a physical and mental breakdown and began taking anti-psychotic and other medications.</td></tr>
