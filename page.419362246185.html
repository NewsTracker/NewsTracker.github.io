<h3>Egypt's Sisi approves anti-terrorism law setting up special courts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo, April 23, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CAIRO: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday approved an anti-terrorism law that sets up special courts and provides protections to its enforcers in the face of a two-year-long insurgency that aims to topple his government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The law also details sentences for various terrorism crimes ranging from five years to the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It also shields those applying it, such as the military and police, from legal ramifications for the proportionate use of force "in performing their duties."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sisi had promised a tougher legal system in July, after a car bomb attack that killed the top public prosecutor, the highest level state official to be killed in years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Forming or leading a group deemed a "terrorist entity" by the government will be punishable by death or life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Membership in such a group will carry up to 10 years in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Financing "terrorist groups" will also carry a penalty of life in prison, which in Egypt is 25 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Inciting violence, which includes "promoting ideas that call for violence" will lead to between five and seven years in jail, as will creating or using websites that spread such ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Journalists will be fined for contradicting the authorities' version of any terrorist attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The original draft of the law was amended following domestic and international outcry after it initially called for imprisonment for such an offence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Egypt is facing an increasingly violent insurgency in North Sinai, where the most active militant group has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Cairo and other cities have also witnessed attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The insurgency, which has killed hundreds of soldiers and police, has intensified since then-army chief Sisi ousted the Islamist former President Mohamed Mursi after mass protests against his rule in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sisi has since overseen a crackdown on Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Thousands of alleged Islamist supporters have been jailed and scores have been sentenced to death, including Mursi and other senior Muslim Brotherhood figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The government considers the Brotherhood a terrorist group and does not distinguish between it and other militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful activism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In February, Sisi signed off on another anti-terrorism law that gave authorities sweeping powers to ban groups on charges ranging from harming national unity to disrupting public order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday approved an anti-terrorism law that sets up special courts and provides protections to its enforcers in the face of a two-year-long insurgency that aims to topple his government.</td></tr>
