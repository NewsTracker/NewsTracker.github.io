<h3>Greece agrees on broad terms of new bailout package</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece has agreed on the broad terms of a new three-year bailout package with international creditors, with a few last details expected to be ironed out Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Finalizing quickly the deal for about 85 billion euros ($93 billion) in new loans would prevent the country from defaulting on its debts next week and secure its future in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We are very close. Two or three very small details remain," Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said as he emerged Tuesday morning from all-night discussions with the creditors' negotiators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The European Commission, a key negotiator in the talks, confirmed the progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The institutions and the Greek authorities achieved an agreement in-principle on a technical basis and talks are still ongoing on finalizing details," said Annika Breidthardt, the Commission's spokeswoman for economic affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She said the details were expected to be cleared up Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She noted that an agreement still requires approval from higher-level representatives, and that senior finance officials from the 28 EU nations would hold a conference call later Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece's government is hoping to push an agreement through parliament this week, ahead of a meeting between eurozone finance ministers on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Germany, the largest single contributor to Greece's two previous bailouts and among the toughest negotiators so far, remained cautious on the timing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We will have to examine the results that come in the course of today," deputy finance minister Jens Spahn told n-tv television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Investors cheered the news of progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece's government borrowing rates fell, a sign investors are less worried about a default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 2-year bond yield dropped by 4.2 percentage points to 14.73 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Athens Stock Exchange, which reopened recently after being shut for five weeks during the most severe part of Greece's financial crisis, was up 2.2 percent in midday trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Cash-strapped Greece needs more money by Aug. 20 at the latest, when it has a debt repayment of just over 3 billion euros to make to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A draft of the agreement cited by the Greek daily Kathimerini said the deal included a package of more than 30 measures that would have to be voted on in Greece's Parliament immediately, followed by a second package of measures to be adopted from October onwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The government released some technical details of the deal, saying it had agreed to have a 0.25 percent government deficit this year and a 0.5 percent surplus next year, when not counting the cost of servicing debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Greece has agreed to achieving so-called primary surpluses of 1.75 percent in 2017 and 3.5 percent in 2018, the government said in an emailed note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The pledges mean the country has avoided having to impose budget savings worth about 20 billion euros, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"This practically means that with the current agreement there will be no fiscal burden - in other words new measures - in the immediate future," the note read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Banks will be strengthened with new cash infusions by the end of the year and will have an immediate boost of "at least 10 billion euros," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The government insists this means there is no longer any danger that the banks may have to raid bank deposits to restore their financial health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The government also said that banks will not make repossessions and auctions of primary residences will not occur within 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The deal is opposed by many in the governing left-wing Syriza party, who say the spending cuts go against the government's pledges when it was elected in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Syriza lawmaker and dissenter Costas Lapavitsas said he would not vote in favor of the new deal in Parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Left-wing governments must take left-wing actions," he said on private Mega television.</td></tr>
