<h3>Ventura helps Royals sweep Angels again with 9-2 win (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- The Kansas City Royals completed another three-game sweep of the Los Angeles Angels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Unlike last October, there was no champagne sprayed in the clubhouse - just a fervent resolve to prove that last year's trip to the World Series wasn't a fluke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Alcides Escobar and Alex Rios hit two-run doubles, Salvador Perez homered and the defending AL champions extended their season-opening win streak to six games with a 9-2 victory on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''To start the year the way that we have is exciting and it's fun to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You just keep it going for as long as you can,'' manager Ned Yost said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''Over the course of 162 games, it's hard to maintain over long stretches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But we're firing on all cylinders right now in all phases of our game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''We're hitting in the clutch and we're hitting for power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Our defense again today was fantastic, so was the starting pitching, and our bullpen came in and did a great job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The winning streak is the Royals' second-longest to open a season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They won their first nine in 2003 under first-year manager Tony Pena, but finished only four games over .500 and third in the AL Central.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Royals and Detroit are the only unbeaten teams left in the majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''We're just playing good baseball as a team,'' third baseman Mike Moustakas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Albert Pujols hit his 522nd home run, moving past Ted Williams, Willie McCovey and Frank Thomas for sole possession of 18th on the career list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The solo drive off Royals ace Yordano Ventura (2-0) landed in the lower seats in the left-field corner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''Obviously, it's a great accomplishment, man, but it's really disappointing,'' Pujols said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''We got swept by a great ballclub.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>I've told you guys my whole career, that at the end of my career I'm going to enjoy it a little bit more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ventura, coming off a 10-1 win at Chicago in which he left in the seventh after 81 pitches because of a cramp in his thumb, allowed two runs and four hits in 5 2-3 innings Sunday before coming out with another cramp - this one in his right calf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After Pujols' homer, Ventura didn't allow another hit until Mike Trout's one-out single in the sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Moments later, Trout slid across the plate on Pujols' double, which center fielder Lorenzo Cain bobbled for the Royals' first error of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Ventura, who was backing up home plate on the play, had some words with Trout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Both dugouts and bullpens emptied, but no punches were thrown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''I was just playing my game,'' Trout said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''I just got a base hit, I got to first base and he was staring at me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>I didn't think I did anything wrong - and then he got in my face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Yost, understandably, defended his pitcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''He pitches with a lot of emotion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He's a real intense competitor, and he got fired up there,'' Yost said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>C.J. Wilson (1-1) allowed seven runs - six earned - and nine hits over 5 2-3 innings after pitching eight innings of two-hit ball in a 2-0 victory at Seattle last Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He took the loss in the finale of last year's AL Division Series, which completed the Royals' three-game sweep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''We were able to put some good swings against him in that playoff game, but he's a good pitcher and he definitely made some adjustments against us today,'' Moustakas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Angels: RF Kole Calhoun, who homered and drove in three runs in Saturday night's 6-4 loss, got the day off to rest a sore calf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''His calf is a little bit tight, so we're just going to take a precautionary day,'' manager Mike Scioscia said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Royals: LHP Danny Duffy makes his second start of the season in the opener of a three-game series at Minnesota, after giving up five runs over five innings last Wednesday in a no-decision at Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker, coming off a 5-3 victory at Seattle in which he allowed three runs over six innings, makes his second start of the season on Monday at Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He is 3-0 with a 1.80 ERA in three career starts against the Rangers.</td></tr>
