<h3>Blair calls for 'new approach' on visit to Gaza Strip</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On a visit to Gaza, the former British prime minister visited Palestinian families still taking shelter in a United Nations-run school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Reconstruction efforts have been slow since last summer's war with Israel, and Blair said some donor countries have not followed through on their funding commitments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blair said the stagnation in reconstruction was a "crime," and took aim at the international community, the Palestinians and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said the current state of Gaza was a result of "those of us in the international community who over the years have made promises" that were not fulfilled, "those who offered leadership and failed to provide," and Israeli and Palestinian politics that have failed to bring "peace and prosperity" to Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Gaza should not be separated from the rest of the world or from the rest of Palestinian territories," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blair called for the Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza, to clarify if it is part of a "broader Islamist movement with regional designs" or if it would accept a long-term peace alongside Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He also called for a "radical change of approach" from Israel to lift trade restrictions on Gaza "so that Gaza can truly be opened up to the outside world, and so that the Gaza people have the freedom of movement and goods and services that Gaza and its economy requires."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Blair also called on Gaza's neighbor Egypt to facilitate movement in and out of Gaza, and lead negotiations about Gaza's long-term future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If we allow Gaza to remain as it is, we are making a fundamental mistake," Blair said.</td></tr>

<h3>Ousted Egypt president starts latest trial on spying charge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The hearing was swiftly adjourned and a new date set for Feb. 28 after the court ruled that the defense should consult with Mohammed Morsi and the other 10 defendants in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutors say the other defendants are members of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood group, which propelled him to office in 2012 but was later banned after the army overthrew him a year later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I am the legitimate president... and this trial is a farce," said a defiant and sometimes smiling Morsi from the defendant's cage at the hearing, presided over by Judge Mohammed Shereen Fahmy at the Cairo Criminal Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The other defendants denied the charges, holding up four fingers in a gesture that has come to symbolize the Brotherhood's cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prosecutors allege that Morsi conspired with the other defendants to leak secret state documents, including military and security files, to Qatar - which had strongly supported Morsi's presidency and became a bitter rival to his military successors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The case hinges on allegations that the defendants conspired to hand deliver documents via national airline EgyptAir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A former EgyptAir cabin crew member is also in the dock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Morsi, overthrown in July 2013 following mass protests demanding his resignation, does not recognize the court, and insists Egypt's current leadership came to power in a coup d'etat and is thus illegitimate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Since then the government, now led by former army chief President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, has launched a sweeping crackdown on the Brotherhood and other political opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Morsi faces three other ongoing trials, on charges that include organizing jailbreaks, conspiring with foreign powers and inciting the killing of protesters - for which he could face the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was Egypt's first democratically elected leader, but his turbulent one-year rule left the country sharply divided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sissi's government has branded the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and has waged a fierce crackdown on it since Morsi's ouster.</td></tr>
