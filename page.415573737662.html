<h3>How the General Social Survey asks about income inequality</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Because the wording of the question has not changed since it was first asked, the survey is a valuable source of data about changes in Americans' attitudes toward the issue, which have varied little in the 36 years the question has been asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The General Social Survey is administered by NORC at the University of Chicago, with financing from the National Science Foundation, primarily using in-person interviewing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The GSS started in 1972 and completed its 30th round in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The typical sample size was 1,500 prior to 1994, but increased to 2,700-3,000 until 2008, and decreased to 2,000 for the most recent surveys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Resulting margins of error are between plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for the smaller sample sizes and plus or minus 2.2 percentage points for the larger sample sizes at the 95 percent confidence level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 2014 survey was conducted March 31-Oct. 11, 2014, among 2,538 American adults.</td></tr>
