<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BEIRUT, May 31 (Reuters) - Islamic State fighters advanced against rival insurgents in northern Syria on Sunday, capturing areas close to a border crossing with Turkey, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The fighters captured the town of Soran Azaz and two nearby villages after clashes with other rebels, the Observatory said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This meant the group could now move along a road leading north to the Bab al-Salam border crossing between the Syrian province of Aleppo and the Turkish province of Kilis.</td></tr>
