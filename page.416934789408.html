<h3>Cash-strapped Greece completes IMF debt payment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Officials say Greece has completed a 757 million euro ($844 million) debt payment to the International Monetary Fund, despite an acute cash shortage that could come to a head within the next two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The payment was duly made Tuesday, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece's radical left Syriza-led government, which is locked in slow-moving bailout negotiations with international creditors, had earlier suggested that payment of salaries and pensions would take priority over debt servicing if it was forced to choose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tuesday's IMF payment was mostly covered by a Bank of Greece account, about whose existence, Syriza party lawmaker Dimitris Vitsas said, central bank officials informed the government last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government has ordered local authorities, universities and hospitals to place their reserves in the central bank to help ease the cash crunch.</td></tr>
