<h3>Silence in Egypt over police abuses amid "war on terror"</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Three men killed in a single day in the Egyptian capital, their deaths united by one common factor: Each was killed by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One was a minibus driver, shot to death when he tried to elude officers asking for his license.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Another was a 19-year-old under police guard in a hospital bed after suffering a gunshot wound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The teen allegedly taunted the guard, who responded by pumping seven bullets into him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The third was beaten to death in a police station, his family and witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Feb. 1 incidents, which took place in two neighboring districts, went largely unnoticed in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But they illustrate warnings by rights activists that the country's security forces, whose oppressiveness helped spark the 2011 uprising, again have a free hand to abuse now that they are waging what the government calls a "war on terror."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At least 121 deaths have been reported in police stations since the beginning of 2014, many caused by deprivation of medical care or torture, Amnesty International said in a report released Wednesday that pointed to a "near total lack of accountability for abuses" by security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The interior minister, Mohammed Ibrahim, who is in charge of police, was removed Thursday in a Cabinet reshuffle, a move Egyptian media said was due to failures in the fight against militants and increasing abuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Associated Press examined the three Feb. 1 deaths by interviewing family members, prosecutors and lawyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In all three cases, authorities have either not prosecuted the policemen involved or are poised to indict them on lesser charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The security forces were once the enforcers of Hosni Mubarak's autocratic rule and faced the brunt of hatred during the 18-day uprising that ousted the longtime president in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The police were humiliated in clashes with protesters, disappearing from the streets for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But they have returned to prominence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Since the military's 2013 ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, security forces have waged a harsh crackdown on Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, killing hundreds of protesters and flooding jails with tens of thousands of detainees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The campaign has been portrayed by the government as a fight against terrorism, as authorities battle an insurgency by Islamic militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Bombings and shootings target police and soldiers several times a week in Cairo and other cities, and media laud the police as heroes in the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Your hands were not tied and won't be tied," President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told police in a speech the day after a Jan. 30 militant attack in Sinai that killed 31 soldiers and policemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Don't be unjust. ... This is not a matter of tying (hands), it is an obligation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Sayyed Tohami's family learned of his death in a phone call from his brother, Mohammed, from the police station in the populous Cairo district of Rod el-Farag where the siblings were both incarcerated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Police had beaten him to death in front of all the inmates, the brother said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tohami's family and friends descended on the station, protesting and chanting, "The police are thugs!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sayyed Tohami had been serving a two-month sentence for possession of a knife, according to his elder brother, Tohami Tohami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Only days before his death, the family filed a complaint that police had beaten him, showing a picture of bruises and cuts on his face and body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Early on the day he died, Sayyed Tohami had complained of stomach pains and was taken briefly to the hospital, Tohami Tohami said, recounting what he was told by other inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Fearing for his safety, the inmates said they shouted and banged on their cell doors, asking where he was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We'll show him to you," they said the guards responded, dragging the handcuffed 28-year-old from cell to cell, jumping on his back, and kicking his head and face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Interior Ministry said Tohami died of diabetes.</td></tr>
