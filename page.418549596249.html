<h3>Apple launches new iPod Touch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This composite product image provided by Apple shows varieties of the new iPod Touch, available for sale on Wednesday, July 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK -- Apple is updating its iPod Touch music player for the first time in nearly three years, as the company seeks to make music a central part of its devices once again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The new Touch has a faster processor and better cameras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It also has a software update that enables Apple Music, a US$10-a-month service that offers unlimited playback of millions of songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple Music launched June 30 as music fans increasingly embrace subscriptions over pay-per-song services such as Apple's industry-leading iTunes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The move comes as iPod's popularity has waned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The iPod was Apple's first successful foray beyond personal computers, and it paved the way for Apple to release the iPhone six years later, in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Although music players existed before, the iPod was the first to simplify syncing with digital music collections on personal computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In recent years, though, many people use smartphones instead to listen to music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The last time Apple gave figures for iPod sales, for the July-September quarter last year, Apple sold 2.6 million iPods, a 24 per cent decline from the previous year and a fraction of the 39 million iPhones sold that quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As demand has slowed, so has Apple's updates to the iPod: Apple no longer updates its iPods annually like it usually does with its top sellers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But the latest move shows Apple isn't giving up on the iPod.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Touch is essentially an iPhone without cellular capabilities, as it runs the same iOS operating system and most of the same apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It extends Apple Music and iPhone apps to teens and other younger customers who might not need cellphones or cannot afford cellular service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Beyond music, the iPod Touch might get new customers hooked on Apple's apps, video and other content -- such that they'll turn to an iPhone, iPad or Mac when they are ready to buy a device that does more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Prices start at $199, the same as an iPhone 6 with a two-year service contract, but the iPod Touch requires no monthly service fees for voice, text and data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Calling is possible through FaceTime video conferencing over Wi-Fi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>-- The processor now matches that in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus from last fall, rather than one from the iPhone 4s in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Apple says the new chip is six times faster for general tasks and 10 times faster for graphics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>-- The rear camera can take sharper pictures, at 8 megapixels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That matches recent iPhones and exceeds the 5 megapixels in the previous Touch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The front and rear cameras can now take 10 shots per second and slow-motion video at 120 frames per second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Customers can experience next-level gameplay, take even more beautiful photos and enjoy their favourite music, TV shows and movies," said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice-president of iPhone, iPod and iOS product marketing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The new Touch won't have all of the iPhone's sensors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>There's no barometer to measure steps climbed and no fingerprint ID to unlock the device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There's also no Apple Pay, the technology for making payments at retail stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The screen remains at 4 inches, as measured diagonally, even though iPhones have gotten bigger at 4.7 and 5.5 inches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Touch ships with iOS 8.4, which includes a new app for Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Although people can still buy songs individually through iTunes, the subscription offers most of Apple's music library at a set price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Users lose access, though, once they cancel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Owners of older Touch models can manually upgrade the operating system for Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The colour choices are silver, grey and gold, matching Apple's other products, plus pink, blue and red.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Apple is introducing a new model with 128 gigabytes for $399.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The base model has 16 gigabytes, enough for thousands of songs, though the iPod Touch is meant to hold photos, video and apps, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The $49 iPod Shuffle and the $149 Nano are getting the same colours, but what's inside isn't changing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Neither model can run Apple Music or the various iPhone apps.</td></tr>
