<h3>FIFA Says Valcke Not Behind $10M Payment in Corruption Probe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Amid a deepening corruption crisis within soccer's governing body, FIFA defended its second-in-command on Tuesday by trying to distance him from claims he helped authorize $10 million in bribes for World Cup bidding votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA said the three payments totaling $10 million mentioned in a U.S. federal indictment, which are at the heart of a Department of Justice probe, were approved in 2007 by Julio Grondona, the former chairman of the finance committee who died last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The FIFA statement follows a New York Times report that American law enforcement officials believe secretary general Jerome Valcke transferred the money in 2008 to accounts controlled by Jack Warner, the former CONCACAF president and FIFA vice president who faces corruption charges in the U.S. The report cited unidentified law enforcement officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>American investigators say Warner's long-time FIFA colleague, Chuck Blazer, believed the money was paid as bribes in exchange for their votes to give the 2010 World Cup to South Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While a FIFA statement did not deny Valcke knew of the payments in 2008, it said neither he "nor any other member of FIFA's senior management were involved in the initiation, approval and implementation" of the project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Valcke's awareness of the $10 million appeared to be confirmed by a letter to him dated March 4, 2008, from then-South African Football Association president Molefi Oliphant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The South African Broadcasting Corporation published the letter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In it, Oliphant asks Valcke for FIFA to withhold $10 million from South Africa's World Cup organizing budget and advance it to a fund called "Diaspora Legacy Program."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Oliphant twice notes that Warner, then Grondona's deputy on the finance panel, should control the money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When contacted by The Associated Press last week, Oliphant declined to comment on the bribery allegations made by the DOJ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He did not answer a call seeking comment on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The World Cup bidding angle is a direct route into FIFA for the Department of Justice, which laid out a racketeering case mostly involving marketing rights for tournaments in North and South America over two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That led to seven officials being arrested last week - including two FIFA vice presidents, one newly elected FIFA executive committee member and a FIFA staffer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They were among 14 people named in a racketeering indictment accusing soccer officials of accepting more than $150 million in bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Four more people, including Blazer and two of Warner's sons, had their guilty pleas unsealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The South African allegation threatens to tarnish a 2010 World Cup which FIFA President Sepp Blatter has claimed as a defining achievement of his 17-year reign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>FIFA described the payment on Tuesday as part of the South African government's "project to support the African diaspora in Caribbean countries as part of the World Cup legacy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It said the payments were authorized by Grondona "in accordance with the organization regulations of FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Grondona served as a member of FIFA's executive committee for 26 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Argentine was the senior FIFA vice president - No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>2 to Blatter at the boardroom table - when he died last year at the age of 82.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The 79-year-old Blatter, who won re-election Friday for a fifth term despite the scandal, denied being the unidentified high-ranking official named in the indictment as having "caused" the payment.</td></tr>
