<h3>Book: Elon Musk almost sold Tesla to Google</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Elon Musk almost sold Tesla Motors to Google two years ago, but then the electric-car maker's fortunes turned around and deal was called off, according to a new book on the maverick entrepreneurial billionaire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Today, Tesla is rolling along, selling thousands of its Model S sedans a year and on track to put its new luxury electric crossover on the market later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But back in March, 2013, Tesla was precarious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Bloomberg News says the new book Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by one of its reporters, Ashlee Vance, asserts that Tesla had gone into crisis mode to save itself from bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At that time, Musk reached out to Google CEO Larry Page, a friend, about selling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Vance cites two unnamed sources in writing that Musk proposed that Google buy Tesla for $6 billion, plus come up with $5 billion more to finance plant expansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He also wanted assurances that Google wouldn't break up or sell Tesla before it produced what it now calls Model 3, its mass-market electric car, still at least a couple of years away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Perhaps the best part of the deal, however, was that Musk came with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He would have been able to run Tesla for eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Page took the deal, but as lawyers worked through the details in the following weeks, Tesla's fortunes improved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cars were delivered, customers became happier and the electric-car maker posted its first quarterly profit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Crisis averted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The deal fell through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And Tesla today is on a much firmer track.</td></tr>
