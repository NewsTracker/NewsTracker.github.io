<h3>Apple's iOS 8.3 Update Is Here</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple today rolled out iOS 8.3, the third major update for iOS 8 -- giving users access to emoji that are more representative of Apple's diverse user base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The update includes emoji that allow users to choose between six different skin tones, same sex couples and families and flags from even more countries, allowing people to show their pride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Unicode Consortium, which sets the standard for emoji for many technology companies, last November released a plan to have more diverse emoji in the group's 2015 update.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Apple supports and cares deeply about diversity, and is working with The Unicode Consortium to update the standard so that it better represents diversity for all of us," an Apple spokesperson told ABC News in February while the update was in beta testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Other updates include a smarter Siri, who can now serve speakers of Russian, Danish, Dutch, Thai, Swedish, Turkish and Portuguese for users set to those languages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Not only is Siri even more multi-lingual, but she can also now start a phone call on speaker phone, making it even easier to chat with someone while you're on the move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The update is compatible for the iPhone 4S and later, various iPads and the fifth generation iPod Touch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>To find out if your device is eligible for the over-the-air update, go to settings, general and then tap software update.</td></tr>
