<h3>Ranchers sue over rule giving feds authority on state water</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ranchers in New Mexico, California and Washington state are challenging a new Obama administration rule giving federal agencies authority to protect some streams and wetlands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Sacramento, California-based Pacific Legal Foundation announced this week it has filed a federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Minnesota on behalf of the ranchers over a recent expansion of the Clean Water Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The rule is a response to calls from the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress for the Environmental Protection Agency to clarify which smaller waterways are protected under the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the foundation argues the rule is unconstitutional because it sets no limit on the Clean Water Act's reach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>EPA spokeswoman Monica Lee declined to comment on the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In June, 13 states led by North Dakota filed a lawsuit over the same rule change.</td></tr>
