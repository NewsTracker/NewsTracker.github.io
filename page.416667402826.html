<h3>Prosecutor quits over Facebook post about Baltimore protests</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DETROIT (AP) - A Michigan prosecutor's office says an assistant prosecutor quit after posting on Facebook that people assaulting police officers in Baltimore should be shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Wayne County Prosecutor's Office spokeswoman Maria Miller said in a statement that Teana Walsh resigned Friday and Prosecutor Kym Worthy accepted it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The statement says the post was "out of character" and "does not reflect the person that we know."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Walsh's now-deleted post on her personal Facebook page said the "solution" for "large swarms of people throwing bricks at police" is "Shoot em. Period."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Associated Press couldn't find a working number for Walsh so she could comment on the post or her resignation.</td></tr>
