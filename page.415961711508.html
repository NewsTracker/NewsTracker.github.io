<h3>Calipari, Kaminsky take top honors from The Associated Press (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They call him the embodiment of everything that's wrong in the one-and-done world of college basketball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He's a crook who landed two programs on probation, a snake-oil salesman who only won a national title because he was able to sell Kentucky to some top prospects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Perhaps that perception has finally started to change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After molding a roster full of McDonald's All-Americans into a 38-0 juggernaut that's two wins shy of another championship, Calipari was voted AP coach of the year on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He received 40 first-place votes from the 65-member national media panel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tony Bennett of Virginia was runner-up with nine votes and Notre Dame's Mike Brey got five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Meanwhile, Wisconsin forward Frank Kaminsky was honored as the AP player of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''I know this, I'm the same guy I've always been,'' Calipari said, when asked whether opinions of him - particularly those in the media - have softened over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''Well, not really.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A lot of things change as you get older.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>My heart's the same,'' Calipari added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Hopefully I've matured and grown up a little bit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Speaking of growing up, Kaminsky has certainly done that the past couple of years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After averaging 10 minutes a game as a sophomore, then having a breakout junior campaign, Kaminsky took another step forward in guiding the Badgers back to the Final Four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The senior was rewarded with 58 first-place votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Duke freshman Jahlil Okafor received five, and Willie Cauley-Stein of Kentucky and Jerian Grant of Notre Dame each received one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I thought about it a little bit,'' Kaminsky said of winning the award.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''Obviously, wasn't one of my main priorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Getting back to the Final Four was it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But being here and being honored by the AP is awesome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It's hardly surprising that Kaminsky was such an overwhelming pick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Besides being a dominant inside-outside threat, the fuzzy 7-footer also has wicked sense of humor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He's become one of the ringleaders on the fun-loving Badgers, his effervescent personality endearing himself to coaches, players and fans alike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''I saw him out in the hallway,'' said Calipari, whose team plays Wisconsin in the Final Four on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Probably about as tired as many folks are of seeing Calipari this time of year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He began making a habit of the NCAA Tournament with UMass in the late 1980s and early '90s, leading the Minutemen to the Final Four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>After a failed stint in the NBA, Calipari returned to the college game - and winning - with Memphis in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But like his first Final Four appearance, another trip with the Tigers in 2008 was later vacated by the NCAA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Calipari's reputation was sullied, even though both transgressions were not entirely his fault: UMass star Marcus Camby was ruled ineligible for contact with an agent, and allegations of academic fraud unrelated to the university brought down Memphis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''Fifty years from now when we're all gone,'' Calipari said, ''people will look back without emotion and say, 'What has he done?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>What did he do for people?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>What did he do for the universities?' Not just me, but all coaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>At least this season, by getting what could have been a mess of egos to play as a team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Players accustomed to being the stars accepted fewer minutes and bit roles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>They decided that in basketball-mad Kentucky, they would eschew any individual spotlight so the Wildcats could chase something greater: The first perfect season since Indiana's in 1976.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In that respect, this may have been Calipari's toughest coaching job yet.</td></tr>
