<h3>Investors commit $10.7 billion in deals including power, tourism at Egypt economic conference</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A jubilant Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi acknowledged Egypt's road to recovery will be long and costly, but described the three-day summit as an overwhelming success, recognizing companies and governments for their vote of confidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I would like to thank you all who came to the event - envoys, deputies or prime ministers, and of course monarchs and kings and princes," he told a packed auditorium in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where crowds gave him several standing ovations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"You have no idea how happy you've made the Egyptian people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At the meeting's closing, a teary-eyed Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab said the conference had netted $36.2 billion in investments that had been signed and were ready to be implemented, thanking allies for the support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dozens of town residents drove up to the conference center as the meeting closed, waving Egyptian flags, honking their horns in celebration, and causing a brief traffic jam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many questions had lingered in the run-up to the conference - whether it would meet expectations for billions in investment, whether companies would be ready to overlook political risks in a country with a lingering militant insurgency, and whether political leaders would be willing to set aside concerns over human rights and vocally back the leadership of el-Sissi, who overthrew his Islamist predecessor in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's a great show of support from investors and world leaders, and an excellent way to hold the government to account for the ambitious policies it has announced," said Angus Blair of investment advisory firm Signet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Besides major Gulf backers United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, who kicked off the conference by announcing over $12 billion in aid and investment, Western powers including the United States, France, Britain and Italy also praised the steps el-Sissi has taken over the past year, a message that was echoed by those from international institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>El-Sissi has staked his legitimacy on fixing the economy and restoring security to the Arab world's most populous country, and the three-day conference had sought a clear sign of international confidence in its political stability, after a 2011 revolt that overthrew longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, followed by military rule and the one-year reign of an elected but divisive president, the Islamist Mohamed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since Morsi's ouster, led by then-army chief el-Sissi, the government has cracked down hard on his Muslim Brotherhood, other Islamists and secular and liberal activists, with hundreds killed and thousands imprisoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The country is also fighting Islamic militants in a corner of the Sinai Peninsula a few hundred kilometers (miles) to the north - a long-running insurgency that picked up after Morsi's overthrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In recent weeks, militants have shifted their focus to a campaign of small bombings aimed at local and foreign business interests in Cairo and other cities, including an American fast food chain, a branch of an Emirati bank, French supermarket chain Carrefour and foreign mobile phone service companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While the government's fierce crackdown on Islamist opponents has killed hundreds, landed some 20,000 people in prison, and brought heavy criticism over the last 20 months, none of that prevented global players from attending the conference, reaffirming their commitments to the country and boosting investments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"With 22 heads of state and 3,500 delegates, it's the largest summit of CEOs and world leaders I've ever seen," said event organizer Richard Attias, who has also arranged the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For his Sunday speech, an elected el-Sissi invited young Egyptian organizers to join him at the podium, where several took photos of themselves with him, including a group selfie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At the end, the participants join el-Sissi in a chant of his oft-used slogan "long live Egypt!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Smiling wide and belting out hearty laughs in the 35-minute address, el-Sissi joked about how he drove hard bargains with top multinational executives to reduce prices, deliver ahead of schedule and allow longer grace periods for loan repayments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He called for a follow-up conference next year to take stock of the country's economic progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He singled out Germany's Siemens, which signed a $10.5 billion agreement to boost Egypt's deficient electricity generation, and the United States' General Electric for special praise, saying they had done service for the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"When somebody stands beside us they will not be forgotten, he said, applauding Siemens for securing financing for its deal, and adding that Egypt needed as much as $300 billion in investments in the next five years to rebuild and give the country's 90 million people a genuine hope to live well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We are behind, and those who are late must either speed-walk or run," he said, imploring his compatriots to "never underestimate your capacities to work for the sake of your country."</td></tr>

<h3>President of cyclone-hit Vanuatu urges global action on disasters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"The reality of what is happening now is in Vanuatu," President Baldwin Lonsdale told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview on Sunday in the northeastern Japanese city of Sendai, where the U.N. conference is taking place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We don't have to depend on the theory. We have to be very practical on what is happening, not only in Vanuatu but around the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Vanuatu - a sprawling cluster of 83 islands and 260,000 people, 2,000 km (1,250 miles) northeast of the Australian city of Brisbane - is among the world's poorest countries and is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, including earthquakes, tsunamis, storms and rising sea levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Shadrack Rubart Welegtabit, the director of Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office who is accompanying the president on his Japan trip, said his country had not been hit by a category 5 storm like Cyclone Pam before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The storm packed winds of more than 300 kph (185 mph) at its height over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The president said he feared the impact from the tropical cyclone would be "the very, very, very worst" in isolated outer islands but damage was still being assessed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He hoped the number of casualties would be "minor", he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Eight deaths have been confirmed so far, with more than 30 people injured, although those figures are expected to rise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Most homes have been damaged or destroyed in the capital, Port Vila, with people seeking temporary shelter where they can, the president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Communications are completely down outside of the capital, and could take weeks to restore, Welegtabit said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Government ministers in Vanuatu have declared a state of emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Aid agencies, including the United Nations, are swinging into action after the president appealed for international help in Sendai on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The country's climate change minister, James Bule, said people in Vanuatu were aware of what to do when warned about the cyclone because they are used to dealing with storms, albeit of a lower strength.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The government has people deployed across the archipelago to make sure communities prepare, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Vanuatu Red Cross Society President Hannington Alatoa told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Sendai that the humanitarian agency's work to educate people to protect themselves from disaster risks over the past 15 years would have helped reduce casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Red Cross - which is considering launching an international appeal for the disaster - has worked with the Vanuatu government to set up a disaster management structure, and trained local people to secure their houses and stock up on food and water, Alatoa added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Easily (deaths) would have been doubled if there was no preparedness, but we have been doing this and it's paying off," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nonetheless the poorest people living in tin shacks in towns would have lost the roofs of their flimsy homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Where the wind is too strong, there is no assurance," Alatoa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Red Cross said on Sunday it had mobilized 200 volunteers who were visiting 26 evacuation centers in Port Vila to help the authorities with registration and aid distribution, and to carry out assessments in all affected areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>According to the head of the Vanuatu disaster management office, the most urgent aid needs include shelter materials such as tarpaulins, water purification tablets, kitchen utensils, bedding and clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The president and his team in Sendai are trying to get back to Vanuatu as soon as they can, but they said being in Sendai had made it easier for them to request help from other governments, the United Nations and international organizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>When they left for Japan on March 10, they knew a storm was coming, but at that stage the winds had not intensified to cyclone strength, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We did not realize how bad it was going to be," the president said.</td></tr>
