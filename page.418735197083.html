<h3>Greece Clears Final Reform Hurdle Before New Bailout Talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - Greek lawmakers have overwhelmingly approved a new batch of reforms demanded by the country's international creditors in return for a third multi-billion euro bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras once again suffered a revolt among his own radical left lawmakers, but had no trouble passing the draft legislation with the backing of pro-European opposition parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The reforms were the final prerequisite before Greece can start negotiations with creditors on a third bailout worth around 85 billion euros ($93 billion).</td></tr>
