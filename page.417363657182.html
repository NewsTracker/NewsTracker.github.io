<h3>Blatter set to win new term despite soccer corruption scandal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ZURICH (Reuters) - World soccer boss Sepp Blatter was expected to be re-elected on Friday, defying growing calls for him to step down in the face of corruption scandals engulfing the sport's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Addressing delegates at FIFA's annual Congress in Switzerland, where members will later vote to decide the organization's presidency, Blatter promised more transparency and urged members to remain unified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Europe, which accounts for all but three of the countries that have ever made it to a World Cup's final match, is particularly keen to banish the 79-year-old Swiss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Asian, African and Latin American states are expected to rally around him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Each of the 209 countries in FIFA has an equal vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On a visit to Berlin, British Prime Minister David Cameron told Blatter to go "the sooner the better".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chancellor Angela Merkel said the dirty side of soccer must be cleaned up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a low key-address that contrasted with a more defiant reaction on Thursday, Blatter said he was "appealing to unity and team spirit so we can move forward together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He also sought to distance himself from the scandal, the biggest crisis FIFA has faced in its 111-year history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>U.S. authorities have accused top FIFA figures and sports executives of corruption, while Switzerland is investigating the award of the next World Cup finals to Russia and Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The scandal widened on Friday when Britain's Serious Fraud Office said it was examining possible corruption at FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A judge in Argentina has ordered the arrest of three businessmen accused of using bribery to obtain soccer media rights, and the Brazilian Senate moved to open a formal inquiry into soccer bribery allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>FIFA takes in billions of dollars in revenue from television marketing rights and sponsorships, making it one of the wealthiest and most powerful sports bodies in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It has been dogged by corruption scandals for decades, mostly investigating itself and avoiding scrutiny by criminal courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We cannot watch everyone all the time. We have 1.6 billion people directly or indirectly touched by our game," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Russia and Qatar deny wrongdoing in their successful bids to host the cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of meddling in an effort to prevent Blatter's re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Qatar on Friday issued a further defense of its bid and said it would carry on with plans to stage the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The decision to host the world's biggest soccer tournament in a small desert state where daytime summer temperatures rarely fall below 40 degrees Celsius startled many in global sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Blatter, who has been criticized for not doing enough to combat corruption in FIFA, is being challenged by Jordanian Prince Ali bin Al Hussein for the most powerful job in soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Many of Blatter's opponents have spoken of steps they can take if he secures re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said England could back a possible boycott of the 2018 World Cup if Blatter stays in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Other European soccer officials have also alluded to the prospect of a boycott, but that is still seen as unlikely given the tournament's importance to the global game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Some countries that have supported Blatter said they were switching allegiance following the scandal, but the numbers still appeared to favor his re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Most of the developing world in Africa, Asia and parts of Central America and the Caribbean are reluctant to vote for a new FIFA leadership given that the organization guarantees them annual grants and bonus payments in World Cup years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Kuwait's Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, one of the most powerful men in world sport, said Blatter is the right man for the job and should be re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"FIFA should have a leader with a lot of experience," the FIFA executive committee member told Reuters at Zurich's Baur au Lac hotel, where seven FIFA executives were arrested on Wednesday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>Canada also said it would not support Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Adding to the pressure on FIFA and Blatter, there are growing concerns from sponsors, many of whom have backed the organization despite nearly 20 years of corruption allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>German sportswear company Adidas said FIFA should do more to establish transparent compliance standards.</td></tr>
