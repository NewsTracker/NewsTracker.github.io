<h3>Three Goldcorp miners found dead in troubled Mexico state</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The corpses were found on Friday in a mass grave in Guerrero state and showed signs of torture, the relatives said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the same state where 43 trainee teachers were abducted late last year and apparently massacred, in an incident that sparked President Enrique Pena Nieto's deepest political crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The state prosecutor's office said on March 6 that four employees of Goldcorp, the world's biggest gold producer by market value, had possibly been kidnapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prior to their disappearance, they were believed to be headed home after finishing their shifts at the Los Filos mine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The fourth employee has since been freed, according to family members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The information available to us about this incident is limited, however the disappearance of the employees was unrelated to their role with Goldcorp," Goldcorp spokeswoman Christine Marks wrote in an e-mail on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The employees were not at the mine conducting Goldcorp business or in Goldcorp-supplied transportation at the time of the incident," she added.</td></tr>
