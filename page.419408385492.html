<h3>Up to 150 drown, shot fleeing Boko Haram ambush in Nigeria: villagers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Up to 150 people have drowned in a river or been shot dead fleeing Boko Haram gunmen who raided a remote village in Nigeria's north-eastern Yobe state, locals say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dozens of militants arrived on motorcycles and a car on Thursday last week and opened fire, scattering terrified residents of Kukuwa-Gari.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>News of the attack was slow to emerge because the militants have destroyed telecom masts around the village since the insurgency began in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They opened fire instantly, which forced residents to flee," Modu Balumi, a resident of the village, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They shot a number of people. Unfortunately many residents who tried to flee plunged into the river which is full from the rain. Many drowned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"By our latest toll we have 150 people either [shot dead] or drowned in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The gunmen deliberately killed a fisherman who tried to save drowning residents of the village."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Balumi said the bodies of many of the drowned were picked out by locals several kilometres away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Most of the victims died in the river while trying to escape," Bukar Tijjani, another villager, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Most residents, particularly women and children, ran towards the river in confusion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"They were pursued by the gunmen, who kept firing at them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A local government official confirmed the attack but put the death toll much lower, at around 50.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The village - about 50 kilometres from Yobe State capital Damaturu - was still reeling from a raid by suspected Boko Haram militants on July 31 when at least 10 people were killed by gunmen who burned homes, food silos and livestock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nigeria's new leader, who came to power on May 29 vowing to destroy Boko Haram, replaced his military chiefs last week, ordering them to end the insurgency within three months.</td></tr>
