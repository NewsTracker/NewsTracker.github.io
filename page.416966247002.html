<h3>Facebook pushes to improve benefits, pay for contractors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) " Facebook is pushing for higher pay and improved benefits for the janitors, cooks and other workers who support its employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The world's largest online social network says it is implementing a set of new standards for its U.S.-based contractors who do a "substantial amount of work" with Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, announced the changes in a blog post late Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new standards include a minimum wage of $15 an hour, at least 15 paid days off, and for those who don't receive paid parental leave, a $4,000 "new child benefit" for new parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Facebook had originally planned to announce the changes last Monday, as the standards are already in place for some teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The announcement was delayed following the sudden death of Sandberg's husband, David Goldberg.</td></tr>
