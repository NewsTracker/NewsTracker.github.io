<h3>Ferguson shooting: no arrests yet as police continue hunt for gunman</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ferguson: Nearly 48 hours after two officers were shot in racially charged Ferguson, Missouri, investigators had dozens of leads but no arrests to report in the hunt for the gunman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>St Louis County Police chief Jon Belmar said authorities had "a pretty good idea" where the gunshots that wounded the officers had originated, without providing any specifics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The kind of gun used, the shooter's motivation and any connection to the protesters remained a mystery, prolonging uncertainty for a town that has come to symbolise America's struggle with race relations and policing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The latest bout of violence in the St Louis suburb, first rattled by the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white officer last summer, brought out signs of sympathy for the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One protester stood opposite the Ferguson police department with a sign "Cops Lives Matter," playing on the "Black Lives Matter" slogan that sprang up in the wake of the deaths of Mr Brown and an unarmed black man in New York City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Belmar, who leads the force in the Missouri county where Ferguson is located, said donations for rewards to help the investigation had poured in over the last two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I cannot tell you at this point that an arrest is imminent. There is certainly nobody in custody," he said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ferguson's police chief, city manager, municipal court judge and two police officers have resigned since the US Justice Department last week released a damning review of the police force in Ferguson, where a majority of residents are African-American and most of the police are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The force is accused of overwhelmingly arresting and issuing traffic citations to black residents, creating a "toxic" environment with its policing practices.</td></tr>
