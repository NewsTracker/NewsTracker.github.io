<tr><td>7</td><td>Hopes of progress in Greece's longstanding bailout talks grew on Thursday after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Athens had committed to resolve the impasse with creditors in coming days to gain access to rescue loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Stock markets rallied, particularly in Greece, as officials sounded optimistic that a deal, which has remained elusive for four months, could be reached in time for next week's meeting of eurozone finance ministers.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>Merkel expressed "hope that the necessary progress can now be made," and underlined that "each day counts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Though such optimism has often in the past come to nothing, it was enough to trigger a big market jump in Greece.</td></tr>
