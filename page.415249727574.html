<h3>Iranian thug who blinded a man in acid attack has an eye GOUGED out</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The man, only identified as Hamid S., poured acid over victim Davoud Roshanaei in 2005, causing him to lose an eye and an ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hamid S was reported to have been sedated in Rajai Shahr prison in Karaj, 33 miles west of the Iranian capital Tehran, on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A team of doctors then removed his left eye, but postponed the removal of his right, state-owned Hamshahri newspaper reported according to the New York Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In addition to his qesas, Hamid S must pay a fine to Mr Roshanaei and serve a ten-year jail sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The surgery was meant to have been carried out in January, but was postponed after medical staff at Rajai Shahr prison refused to carry out the qesas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'The delay is from the medical side and is not our fault,' a judge later told the state-run Iranian Fars news agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'We had a meeting with the forensic medicine and they will let us know once there is a doctor who is willing to carry out the sentence'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An international Iranian human rights organisation based in Norway has condemned the punishment, calling it 'barbaric'.</td></tr>

<h3>Boko Haram readies for battle in northeast Nigeria, residents say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A woman trapped there since Gwoza was seized in July told her daughter that Islamic extremists are urging civilians to leave town to avoid being killed in crossfire in an anticipated major battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hajiya Adama said her mother said the fighters also have released young women being held against their will, including some made pregnant during their captivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She said her mother left last week and escaped to the town of Yola, in neighboring Adamawa state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"She told me that Boko Haram terrorists asked them to leave suddenly, that they were preparing grounds for a major battle," Adama told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"She said while being helped by other women to leave through Madagali, they saw many Boko Haram terrorists in trucks and some on bikes moving toward Gwoza."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An intelligence officer said security forces are moving slowly for fear of harming civilians, and especially since Boko Haram is surrounding Gwoza with land mines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He confirmed forces from Chad are in the area, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Boko Haram in August declared an Islamic caliphate across a swath of northeast Nigeria where it held sway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In recent weeks, Chadian and Nigerian troops have retaken a score of towns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the militants continue to kill scores in suicide bombings and village attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Retaking Gwoza would be a major coup for Nigeria and for the campaign of President Goodluck Jonathan for re-election at critical March 28 ballots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Critics say the contest is too close to call between Jonathan, a southern Christian, and retired Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator who has vowed to stamp out the 6-year-old insurgency that has killed an estimated 12,000 people and left 1.6 million homeless.</td></tr>
