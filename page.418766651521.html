<h3>Turkey launches fight against Islamic State and allows US warplanes to use bases for airstrikes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A teenage boy uses binoculars to look at Turkish army tanks holding positions, near the border with Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Istanbul: Turkey plunged into the fight against Islamic State this week, rushing forces into the first direct combat with its militants on the Syrian border and granting permission for United States warplanes to use two Turkish airbases for bombarding the group in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In what Turkish officials described as the first direct cross-border confrontation with the Islamic State, Turkish fighter jets scrambled as tanks and artillery of its fifth Armoured Brigade shelled militants across the border on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The developments ended a long-standing reluctance by Turkey, a NATO member and ally of the United States, to play a more aggressive part in halting IS's expanding reach and influence in the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>US officials said it carried the potential to strike IS targets with far greater effect because of Turkey's proximity, which will allow more bombings and surveillance missions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A US Air Force plane takes off from the Incirlik airbase, in southern Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Turkey, a vital conduit for the Islamic State's power base in Syria, had come under increased criticism for its inability - or unwillingness - to halt the flow of foreign fighters and supplies across its 804-kilometre border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Up to now, Turkey has placed a priority on dealing with its own restive Kurdish population, which straddles the Syrian border in the southeast, and in the toppling of Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, whom the Turks blame for creating the conditions in his war-ravaged country for the rise of Islamic extremism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But now that extremism has increasingly menaced Turkey, where 1.5 million Syrian war refugees have also been straining the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A series of Islamic State attacks on Turks, including a devastating suicide bombing a few days ago that officials have linked to the extremist group, may also have helped accelerate the shift in Turkey's position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mourners bury victims of Monday's bomb blast in Suruc, Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Turkish internal security officials had signalled their growing concern about the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, with a series of large-scale raids in the past few weeks, detaining hundreds of suspected Islamic State members and sympathisers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Taking the fight to Islamic State in Syria, however, represents a huge leap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The terrorist organisation represents a national security threat to Turkey and we are working closely with our allies including the United States, to combat terrorism," a senior official in the Prime Minister's office said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of government protocol restrictions, also emphasised that Turkey had not changed its position regarding Assad in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An Islamic State flag flies in the northern Syrian town of Tel Abyad in June, seen from the Turkish border town of Akcakale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At the same time as the first confrontation was taking place, Obama administration officials, who have been negotiating with Turkey for months, said on Thursday that they had reached an agreement for manned and unmanned US warplanes to carry out aerial attacks on Islamic State positions from air bases at Incirlik and Diyarbakir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The agreement was described by one senior administration official as a "game changer".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It was sealed on Wednesday with a phone call between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and US President Barack Obama, another administration official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Police forensic experts examine the street following an attack on police officers in Diyarbakir, Turkey on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Turkey had allowed unarmed surveillance flights from Incirlik but had balked at anything more muscular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Officials at both the State Department and the Pentagon said they were hesitant to talk about the pact until the Turkish government acknowledged it publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Turkish officials declined to comment on the pact by press time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The United States and Turkey "have decided to further deepen our co-operation in the fight against ISIL," the US State Department's spokesman, John Kirby, said, adding that "due to operational security I don't have further details to share at this time".</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Relatives of police officers Feyyaz Yumusak and Okan Acar, mourn during their funeral procession in Sanliurfa, Turkey on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The clash between Turkey's armed forces and the Islamic State came after gunmen identified by the Turkish military as Islamic State fighters fired on a Turkish border outpost in the Kilis region, killing one Turkish soldier and wounding five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Turkish military said in a statement that its border shelling was a response, and that at least one militant was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Turkish news media said a number of Islamic State vehicles were obliterated in the shelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The clash came three days after a suicide bomber with suspected ties to the Islamic State struck a cultural centre in the Turkish border town of Suruc, killing 32 people and wounding more than 100.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That bombing was one of the worst in Turkey in many years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Obama administration officials said the United States had agreed to work with European allies, including Germany, France and Britain, to do more to control their end of the flow of foreign fighters crossing Turkey to reach Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Acknowledging that commitment to Turkey, Mr Kirby said the United States recognised that "the foreign fighter problem is not Turkey's alone".</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It was unclear what other concessions might have been made by the United States to conclude the deal, but a NATO official said on Thursday that "the Turks always drive a hard bargain."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The breakthrough came after recent talks between General John R. Allen, a retired marine who is President Obama's special envoy for the fight against the Islamic State, and Turkish counterparts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>General Allen's trip was preceded by a telephone call from Vice President Joe Biden to President Erdogan, administration officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>A senior Defence Department official said recent Islamic State attacks on Turkish targets had played an important role in Turkey's decision to join the fight against the militant organisation directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Attacks in Turkey are part of the catalyst for them to think about how they get in the game," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>For the Pentagon, the Turkish decision is huge because the two airbases are so much closer to the Syrian border than Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan and the Persian Gulf, where strikes had been launched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The agreement will significantly increase the amount of time US spy planes can hover over Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In addition, it will accelerate the response time for manned flights acting on intelligence information.</td></tr>
