<h3>US Republicans hail Netanyahu comeback win in Israel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Congratulations to Prime Minister Netanyahu on his re-election. He's a true leader who will continue to keep Israel strong and secure," Jeb Bush, a Republican prospective frontrunner in the 2016 presidential race, said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker hailed Netanyahu, as well as center-left challenger Isaac Herzog for "his competitive run."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The oldest and most stable democracy in the Middle East has once again gone through a hotly-contested election and will peacefully form a new government," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Even with results still up in the air late Tuesday, some Republicans were quick to declare success for the savvy Israeli politician known to many as "Bibi."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Congrats to Netanyahu on victory in Israeli elections. A true leader in a wilderness of turmoil," congressman Jeff Duncan wrote on Twitter, barely 90 minutes after polls closed in the Jewish state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While Tea Party favorite Senator Ted Cruz late Tuesday applauded a Netanyahu victory and assured that Americans "are proud to stand steadfastly with our Israeli brothers," he slammed President Barack Obama for his tense ties with Netanyahu and opposing his recent visit to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"His electoral success is all the more impressive given the powerful forces that tried to undermine him, including, sadly, the full weight of the Obama political team," Cruz wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Republicans control both chambers of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Earlier this year, House Speaker John Boehner caused a political uproar when, without consulting the White House, he invited Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Several Democratic lawmakers boycotted that address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Most Democrats used discretion in the early hours of Wednesday, and in the run up to the poll, they largely held their verbal fire, opting instead to point to the historic and cultural US-Israeli ties.</td></tr>

<h3>Sorry, Kim Jong-un! Sony has made huge comeback</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Take that, North Korea!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shares of Sony (SNE) are up more than 40% from the lowest point they hit in December in the wake of the hack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That's when everyone was talking about leaked emails and threats against movie theaters because of Sony's plan to release "The Interview" -- the controversial comedy about a plan to assassinate North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Sony told investors in February that the cost associated with the hacking was a mere $15 million in its latest quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company officially released those quarterly results on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sony's stock soared nearly 4% Tuesday and another 5% on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Overall sales were up 6.5% from a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The only significant weak link was the company's Pictures unit, which includes Sony's movie and television studios.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Revenues fell nearly 8%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fun with numbers: PS4 and iPhone 6 lead to big bucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Still, it's a mistake to focus too much on the movie business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Two bigger units at Sony are doing much better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sony's gaming division posted a 17% jump in sales in its most recent quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That's largely due to the success of the company's PlayStation 4 gaming console.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Then there's the company's devices business, which reported a nearly 40% surge in revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The reason?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That division includes Sony's image sensors --chips sold to makers of mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>One major customer in this market is Apple (AAPL, Tech30), which uses Sony's image sensors in the camera for the iPhone 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Being part of the Apple supply chain is pretty lucrative these days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And there may even be some brighter times ahead for Sony's Hollywood unit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The Interview" wound up being a phenomenal financial success after all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Hooray for Hollywood?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The company originally agreed to pull the Seth Rogen/James Franco movie because the big theater owners said they were worried about safety and would not show it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But Sony eventually released it digitally and in a small group of theaters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Sony said in late January that the movie generated more than $40 million from on-demand downloads and streams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It also made about $6 million at the box office in its limited theatrical run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The company's recent deal to let Marvel owner Disney use Spider-Man in upcoming Marvel movies could also give a big shot in the arm to Sony as it looks to relaunch the franchise again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>(For convoluted reasons, Sony has the rights to Peter Parker and his web-slinging alter ego even though Disney acquired Marvel.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sony also seems poised to cash in on the digital streaming rights to Seinfeld.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>According to recent reports, Sony's TV studio is in talks to sell the "Seinfeld" rights in a deal that could reach $500,000 an episode -- a total of more than $100 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), Yahoo (YHOO, Tech30) and Hulu -- the streaming site owned by Disney (DIS), Fox (FOXF) and Comcast (CMCSA) -- are said to be bidding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But not Netflix (NFLX, Tech30).</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It's all about the yen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Sony can also thank Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe for the rebound in its stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>His policies, dubbed Abenomics, have led to a big surge in Japanese stocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The Nikkei is up 12% this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The yen has weakened, which has helped Japanese exporters like Sony become more profitable abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Japan's central bank is also doing all it can to prop up the economy with a bond buying program similar to the quantitative easing that the Federal Reserve used up until last year ... and that the European Central Bank is employing now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>So as long as the yen continues to lose ground against the dollar, Sony's post-hack comeback should remain intact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Maybe it's even time to start thinking about a sequel for "The Interview?"</td></tr>
