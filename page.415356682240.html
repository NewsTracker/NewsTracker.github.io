<h3>Boko Haram hits Maiduguri again as Nigeria dismisses IS link</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A suspected female suicide bomber blew herself up at the crowded Monday Market, which has been repeatedly hit by Boko Haram attacks, including on Saturday, according to witnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Borno state police commissioner Clement Adoda told reporters that at least seven people died and 17 others were injured in the explosion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Medical sources said staff were "overwhelmed", as they were still treating some of the 139 people injured in Saturday's blasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mohammed Kanar, the northeast coordinator for Nigeria's main emergency management agency (NEMA) said the authorities successfully carried out a controlled explosion on a second device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Another bomb planted... not far from the market was safely destroyed by security operatives. People mistook the explosion for a second attack," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The latest attack came after the government in Abuja described the militants' pledge of allegiance to IS as a sign of weakness in the face of growing military pressure from Nigeria and its allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>National security spokesman Mike Omeri called it "an act of desperation and comes at a time when Boko Haram is suffering heavy losses".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He added: "Boko Haram is on the way to being eliminated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"No foreign extremists can or will change this fact -- as long as the Nigerian military continues to receive cooperation and commitment from its citizens and allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There will be no Islamic State in Nigeria, the only state that will exist is the united Federal Republic of Nigeria."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Omeri's tough talk come as Boko Haram is being squeezed out of captured territory in three northeastern states of Nigeria by a regional coalition of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The armies have claimed a series of successes in recent weeks, with the operation designed to secure and stabilise the northeast so that elections can take place on March 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Nigerian army said on Tuesday it had foiled a Boko Haram attack on the town of Gombi, in Adamawa state, on Monday evening, seizing heavy weaponry and ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That followed a Chadian and Nigerien offensive on Monday to retake the Borno state town of Damasak, which fell into rebel hands last November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Niger said that as of March 8, 24 police and soldiers as well as one civilian were killed since the country became involved in the regional fight-back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some 513 Boko Haram fighters were killed in the same period in fighting in southeastern Niger, national police spokesman Adily Toro but there was no independent verification of the numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Security analysts have said Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau's pledge of allegiance to his IS group counterpart Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may only have propaganda value in the short term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tuesday's bomb attack in Maiduguri -- and a spate of others across the wider north -- have underscored the fragile security in the run-up to the elections, which Shekau has vowed to disrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Boko Haram conflict, which began in 2009, has claimed more than 13,000 lives and left some 1.5 million homeless, with refugees spread across Nigeria and neighbouring countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Tuesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned of an increasingly dire situation for the displaced in the strategic Lake Chad region, where Nigeria meets Niger, Chad and Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"There is a full-blown humanitarian crisis around this lake, not only in Nigeria, but also in the surrounding countries," ICRC spokesman Jean-Yves Clemenzo told reporters in Geneva.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The organisation said it had stepped up its efforts in the region, providing food, household items, sanitary facilities and assistance to help cope with the influx of casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But the head of the ICRC delegation in Nigeria, Karl Mattli, said: "It's not enough. More has to be done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The vast numbers of displaced people -- many of whom have flocked to Maiduguri -- has been a nagging question in the run-up to the vote, at which President Goodluck Jonathan is seeking re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The region is a main opposition stronghold but with many voters unable to return home to cast their ballots, the validity of the overall result may be questioned if they are disenfranchised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Nigeria's electoral commission is scrambling for a solution to the issue, including temporary voter ID cards.</td></tr>

<h3>CIA Linked To Apple Hacking Programme</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The CIA has worked for nearly a decade to break the security protecting Apple phones and tablets, according to a report citing documents obtained from Edward Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Investigative news website The Intercept said on Tuesday the top-secret programme was aided by British intelligence services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report said efforts to break into Apple products started as early as 2006, a year before the introduction of the first iPhone, and continued as recently as 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>US government researchers reportedly built a version of XCode - Apple's software application development tool - to create surveillance backdoors into programmes distributed on Apple's App Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The attempt to hack "secure communications products, both foreign and domestic" also targeted Google Android phones, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Intercept stopped short of saying whether the CIA successfully cracked Apple's encryption coding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An Apple spokesman pointed to public statements by CEO Tim Cook on privacy, but declined to comment further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services," Cook wrote in a statement published last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple and other top technology companies have been working to restore faith among consumers concerned that products have become tools for widespread government surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In September, Apple strengthened encryption methods for data stored on iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The company said the changes meant it no longer had any way to extract customer data even if a government ordered it to with a search warrant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Google Inc announced shortly afterward it also planned to increase the use of stronger encryption tools.</td></tr>
