<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad - Trinidad Attorney General Garvin Nicholas said Wednesday that officials feared former FIFA Vice President Jack Warner would flee the island after facing U.S. federal corruption charges, but they're now confident he'll stay in the country.</td></tr>
