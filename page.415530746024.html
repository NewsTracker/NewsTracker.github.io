<h3>Vanuatu's Tanna island residents are running out of food after Cyclone Pam</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tanna: Residents of the southern Vanuatu island of Tanna said they were running out of food and basic supplies on Tuesday, after a huge cyclone tore across the South Pacific nation wreaking widespread devastation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Relief workers were still battling on Tuesday night to reach many of the islands pummelled by Cyclone Pam's gusts of more than 300 km/h on Friday and Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A woman holds her three-year-old outside their damaged home as night falls in Tanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With communications cut off and reconnaissance flights revealing destroyed houses, shredded forests and damaged buildings, international aid agencies had been particularly worried about Tanna, which bore the full force of the storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said reconnaissance by the military "confirmed significant damage in the southern islands".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Particularly Tanna island, where it appears that more than 80 per cent of houses and buildings have been partially or completely destroyed," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Food has become scarce after Cyclone Pam flattened the southern Vanuatu island Tanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Not only buildings flattened, but palm plantations, trees. It's quite a devastating sight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A witness on the island of 29,000 people, about 200 kilometres south of the capital, said that while damage was extensive, it appeared most of the population had survived by sheltering in schools, churches and other sturdy buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"People sheltered in school buildings. We were helping one another," Ropate Vuso, 67, told Reuters in Tanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This villager was injured when he was hit by masonry caused by a shipping container breaking through a concrete wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We are running short of food, water, shelter and electricity. We have no communications, we are still waiting for the people from parliament, the chief and the president, but still nobody is coming."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There were unconfirmed reports of four deaths in and around the main town of Tanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Aircraft flying over other outlying islands had seen large white "Hs" marked out on the ground, or residents trying to signal for help with mirrors, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Aid onboard an Australian RAAF C-17 Globemaster on its way to Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The United Nations said the official death toll from the cyclone was 11, revising down its earlier figure of 24, but many officials anticipate that number would rise once they are able to more thoroughly inspect the outer islands of the scattered archipelago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Tuesday it was confirmed a Swedish man aged around 80 who had emigrated was among the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the capital Port Vila the clean-up was progressing after trees were uprooted and homes flattened, but there were worries about food scarcity and health after the main local food market was destroyed and the city's hospital severely damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Bishop said Australia was sending a 20-strong emergency medical assistance team of doctors, nurses, paramedics and a pharmacist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They plan to set up a temporary ward in the car park of the damaged Port Vila hospital capable of treating up to 40 patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Thousands are still staying in shelters overnight, with a 6pm-6am curfew in place to prevent looting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The majority of locals rely on foods sold at the downtown market such as taro, island cabbage, bananas, kumara and yams for their staple diet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Shops selling tinned food were open and stocked in the capital, but many locals do not have the money to buy them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We have water, but the situation is very bad because people don't have local food," shop owner Colette Calvo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"All they can eat is food like bananas that they pick up off the ground and they can get sick."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Australia, which has already sent five planes with personnel and humanitarian supplies, dispatched another three planes on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It also began loading its emergency response ship HMAS Tobruk, which is capable of driving onto beaches, for possible deployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A French navy ship was also being sent from nearby New Caledonia, while a US Marine Corps-based Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief team was also being made ready, Australian defence officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Tourism, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Vanuatu's economy, has been badly affected, with Port Vila closed to cruise liners indefinitely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Almost 200 people, most of whom were Australian tourists or workers, were evacuated on two Australian military flights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Australia had another plane on standby to evacuate the elderly, the sick, pregnant women and children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Aid officials said the storm was comparable in strength to Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people.</td></tr>

<h3>'Devastating sight' - Vanuatu left in ruins after Cyclone Pam</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Radio and telephone communications with the outer islands were just beginning to be restored, but remained incredibly patchy three days after Cyclone Pam hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>People were expressing their need for help any way they could: flashing mirrors or marking an "H'' in white on the ground to signal planes that were surveying the outer islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Australian military planes that conducted aerial assessments found significant damage, particularly on Tanna Island, where more than 80 percent of homes and other buildings appeared to be partially or completely destroyed, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We understand that the reconnaissance imagery shows widespread devastation," Ms Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Not only buildings flattened - palm plantations, trees. It's quite a devastating sight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Teams of aid workers and government officials carrying medical and sanitation supplies, water, food and shelter equipment managed to land on Tanna and neighbouring Erromango Island on yesterday afternoon, said Colin Collett van Rooyen, Vanuatu director for aid group Oxfam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The two islands were directly in the path of the storm, which packed winds of 270 kilometres per hour when it hit early Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An aerial assessment showed extensive damage on Erromango, with communities ranging from 70 percent to 100 percent destroyed on the archipelago's fourth-largest island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On other islands, Collett van Rooyen said plane crews saw people had made big, white "H'' marks in multiple villages, and people on Tongoa island flashed mirrors to attract attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The destruction on Tanna was significantly worse than in the nation's capital of Port Vila, where Pam destroyed or damaged 90 percent of the buildings, said Tom Perry, spokesman for CARE Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The airport was badly damaged, the hospital was badly damaged but still functioning ... there's one doctor there at the moment," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's obviously a pretty trying situation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that 11 people were confirmed dead, including five on Tanna, lowering their earlier report of 24 casualties after realizing some of the victims had been counted more than once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Officials with the National Disaster Management Office said they had no accurate figures on how many were dead, and aid agencies reported varying numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The confusion reflects the difficulty of handling a disaster that struck whole communities on remote islands with a near-total communications blackout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Vanuatu is a challenging place at the best of times, in the sense of getting around and logistics," Mr Perry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"So a situation like this is pretty testing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Poor weather and communications issues have hampered relief workers efforts to reach the outer islands for days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Most of the islands have no airports and those that do have only small landing strips that are tricky for large supply planes to navigate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On the main island of Efate, bridges were down outside Port Vila, impeding vehicle traffic.</td></tr>
