<h3>CANNES WATCH: Tom Hardy on wheels again in 'Mad Max'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) " "Mad Max: Fury Road" is Tom Hardy's second film in two years to take place almost entirely on wheels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In 2013's "Locke," Hardy played a construction manager who on a speedy nighttime drive fields a series of calls to confront a painful marital indiscretion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He barely moves from his seat throughout the film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In "Mad Max: Fury Road," which hit theaters this weekend after a wave of critical excitement and a glitzy premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Hardy is again on the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This time, however, the action extravagance of director George Miller's dystopian sequel makes for a much bumpier ride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's kind of the physicalized, athletic stunt version of 'Locke,'" Hardy said, laughing, in a recent interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I did all the dialogue in 'Locke' and now it's just the physical dance piece in S&M clothes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While the drama of "Locke" relied entirely on Hardy's verbal dexterity and subtle movement, "Fury Road" is essentially a nonstop two-hour car chase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Cannes, Hardy apologized to Miller for "being so myopic" about the project during production, which took place over a lengthy, sometimes trying, shoot in Namibia in southern Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Hardy " like many who have seen the film " was blown away by the result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He chooses a very simple narrative, which is: 'Drive out to the middle of the desert and drive back. Now how complicated can we make something so simple?'" said Hardy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's head and shoulders above every other action film I've seen. When I was on the ground shooting it, I had no idea what was going on whatsoever."</td></tr>
