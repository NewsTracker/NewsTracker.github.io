<h3>Oakland courts Lucas museum if Chicago plan falters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Oakland officials tell Lucas their city is ready if plan falls through in Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>If plans for the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art fall through in Chicago, another West Coast city is attempting to position itself as an alternative site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Officials in Oakland, Calif., have written to George Lucas, saying their city would welcome the museum, according to Bay Area media reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The recent outpouring of negative sentiment in Chicago against MAD Architects' proposal for George Lucas' lakefront museum is troubling to read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Bay Area Council, with the blessing of the Oakland mayor, wrote Lucas in February, according to the San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Business Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In the event you are preparing a list of alternative locations, we respectfully would like to propose a venue that we believe could be a wonderful fit for you and your museum," the letter stated, according to the Business Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The group's executive compared Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco, to the Rebel Alliance from the "Star Wars" movies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Oakland is trying to join Los Angeles as a possible backup site for Lucas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In January, Lucas said complications with the Chicago plan may put Los Angeles back in the running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A lawsuit challenging the proposed lakefront site in Chicago was filed in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The next hearing on the case is scheduled for March 12 in federal court in Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Lucas selected Chicago over San Francisco and Los Angeles in June as the site for his collection of art and movie memorabilia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Friends of the Parks filed suit in federal court against the Chicago Park District, which owns the land where the museum would be built.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The group argues that the site was part of Lake Michigan until it was filled in during the 1920s, and thus remains a protected waterway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The lawsuit insists that the city would need approval from the state before proceeding with the museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We still have to get through some lawsuits and things in Chicago," Lucas told Tribune Newspapers in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Once we make it through, we'll be on our way. But it's still a possibility that Chicago will be unable to do it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The museum is planned for a 17-acre lakefront site now occupied by two parking lots south of Soldier Field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>If the Chicago effort moves forward, the museum is expected to open in 2018.</td></tr>
