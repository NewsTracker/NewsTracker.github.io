<h3>Obama announces changes for student loan repayment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Obama signed a "student aid bill of rights" and spelled out an assortment of policy tweaks and projects to try to make it easier for people with student loans to pay back their debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We're going to require that the businesses that service your loans provide clear information about how much you owe, what your options are for repaying it, and if you're falling behind, help you get back in good standing with reasonable fees on a reasonable timeline," Obama told a raucous crowd of more than 9,500 students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're going to take a hard look at whether we need new laws to strengthen protections for all borrowers, wherever you get your loans from," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Obama has asked the Treasury and Education departments and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to report by Oct. 1 on whether bankruptcy laws or other laws or regulations should be changed for student loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The lending industry has resisted loosening bankruptcy standards for student loans, but advocates have argued students burdened by heavy debt should be able to more easily use that as a way to discharge their obligations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The review will focus on private student loans that do not carry protections given to federal student loan borrowers, such as the ability for borrowers with permanent disabilities to discharge loans, an administration official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The White House said 40 million Americans have student loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>More than 70 percent of U.S. students who graduate with a bachelor's degree leave with debt, which averages $28,400.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The White House said it will require clearer disclosures from companies to make sure borrowers understand who is servicing their loan and how to set monthly payments and change repayment plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Obama will direct his Education Department to create a system by July 1, 2016, to better oversee and address complaints from borrowers about lenders, servicers and collection agencies, the White House said.</td></tr>

<h3>Nearly 11.7 million signed up for Obamacare health insurance: HHS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly 11.7 million people have either signed up or re-enrolled for insurance coverage under the U.S. healthcare reform law, more than the 9.1 million predicted by the Obama administration,health officials said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As of Feb. 22, about 8.8 million signed up in one of the 37 states that use online exchanges operated by the federal government and 2.85 million were in the 14 states, and Washington, D.C., that operate their own exchanges, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Democratic-backed Affordable Care Act, narrowly passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition, aimed to help millions of Americans without health insurance obtain coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Conservatives criticize the law, commonly called Obamacare, as government overreach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The online exchanges, or marketplaces, are geared toward those who do not receive insurance through their employer and provide tax subsidies on a sliding scale to make health coverage affordable for low-income people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the states that use the federal exchange, called healthcare.gov, 87 percent qualified for a tax credit averaging $263 per month, according to HHS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It said more than half of consumers in states using healthcare.gov bought a plan that cost $100 or less after tax credits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Enrollment across the board has largely exceeded expectations, health officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The enrollment period for 2015 coverage opened on Nov. 15 and closed on Feb. 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>President Barack Obama's healthcare policy has been challenged in the courts since the outset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the latest case, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on March 4 and is expected to decide this year whether or not to throw out tax subsidies in states that do not operate their own marketplaces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If the court rules against the Obama administration, up to 7.5 million people in at least 34 states would lose the tax subsidies, according to consulting firm Avalere Health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More than 4.1 million people under 35 years old have purchased health insurance through state and federal exchanges, the HHS said Tuesday, about a third of enrollees.</td></tr>
