<h3>Despite tie, Netanyahu secures shot at 4th term as Israel PM</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Here is a look at how the main players fared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu's Likud Party came from behind after trailing in the polls to pull roughly even with its main rival, the center-left Zionist Union led by Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The comeback, fueled by an aggressive appeal to his hard-line base, gave Netanyahu a strong shot at securing a fourth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Both he and Herzog now compete for a chance to form a coalition that commands a majority in the 120-seat parliament, a complicated task in Israel's fractured political landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some say Netanyahu has a better chance than Herzog of cobbling together a government, by courting his "natural allies," rightist and religious parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Herzog would have to appeal to more ideologically diverse allies, including hard-liners and religious parties, and perhaps Arab parties, to build a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FILE - In a Monday, March 16, 2015 file photo, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a Likud party meeting in Or Yehuda near Tel Aviv, Israel, a day ahead of legislative elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Israel's election has yielded a fractured parliament and no clear winner, setting up a horse-trading phase that seems likely to leave Netanyahu in his post and place the country on the brink of confrontation with the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It could also force a joint government with moderate challenger Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And there is the slimmest of chances that Herzog, through machinations, ends up on top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Everything is in the hands of Moshe Kahlon, a relative newcomer to the big leagues of Israeli politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kahlon, the 54-year-old leader of an upstart centrist party, Kulanu, is seen as the kingmaker of the inconclusive elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With his party's predicted 10 seats, according to TV exit polls, Kahlon would have a decisive say in who becomes the next prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kahlon has said his main objective is to become Israel's next finance minister in order to carry out economic reforms and lower the cost of living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kahlon hasn't said whom he favors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He has deep political roots in the Likud but fell out with Netanyahu two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This unprecedented union of four largely Arab-backed factions became Israel's third largest party - with 13 seats, according to exit polls - and gave Israel's Arab minority significant leverage in parliament for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Party leader Ayman Odeh said Tuesday that the Joint List will try to prevent the formation of a Netanyahu-led government, but will not join a Herzog-run coalition - to avoid having to be party to decisions on possible military campaigns or building more Jewish settlements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the event of a Netanyahu-Herzog unity government, the Joint List expects to take on the high profile role of leader of the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When Netanyahu called early elections three months ago, Herzog and his Labor Party were seen as politically too weak to mount an effective challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Herzog confounded expectations, rising in the polls after joining forces with former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and her centrist Tnuah party to form an alliance they called the Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Despite his quiet demeanor and perceived lack of charisma, Herzog emerged as a credible candidate for prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He has a long shot at the top job, if he can persuade Kahlon to back him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Netanyahu's ultra-nationalist foreign minister last year promoted legislation raising the vote threshold for parties getting into parliament - and almost became a victim of his own initiative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Lieberman's Israel Beitenu barely crossed the threshold with five seats, according to exit polls, a sharp drop from the 2013 election when his joint list with Likud won 31 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Despite his hawkish views, Lieberman hasn't said if he will endorse Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A deal with Israel on the terms of Palestinian statehood remains at the core of Abbas' political strategy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In the final stretch of the campaign, Netanyahu vowed to prevent the creation of such a state on his watch, going back on long-standing promises to the international community and the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>If Netanyahu wins another term, Abbas would have to acknowledge that his strategy has failed and likely be pushed into a more confrontational approach toward Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Herzog has said he wants to resume negotiations with the Palestinians, but would likely be constrained by a diverse coalition and not be able to take risky decisions required in any peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has become increasingly strained, particularly after the Israeli leader openly challenged the president's efforts to negotiate a deal on curbing Iran's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>If Netanyahu secures another term, the two leaders would have to find a way to work together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A decisive victory by Israel's center-left camp would have made it easier for Obama to push for a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 24, 2015 file photo, Moshe Kahlon speaks during a debate hosted by the Israel Women's Network in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Israel's election has yielded a fractured parliament and no clear winner, setting up a horse-trading phase that seems likely to leave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his post and place the country on the brink of confrontation with the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>FILE - In a Monday, March 16, 2015 file photo, Israeli leader of the center-left Zionist Union Isaac Herzog speaks with Israeli voters persuading them to vote for him in the upcoming Israeli elections in his party headquarters in Tel Aviv, Israel, a day ahead of legislative elections.</td></tr>
