<h3>Rangers clinch playoff spot with 5-1 win over Senators (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kreider had two goals and an assist and the New York Rangers clinched a playoff spot with a 5-1 win over the Ottawa Senators on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dan Boyle, Mats Zuccarello and Tanner Glass also scored for the Rangers, who have 101 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''You have to be able to handle momentum swings and to be able to answer with a goal is a big,'' Kreider said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Rangers have reached the playoffs in five consecutive seasons and in nine of the past 10 seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cam Talbot made 23 saves for New York, which handed Ottawa's Andrew Hammond his first regulation-time loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hammond allowed five goals on 22 shots and is 14-1-1 to start his NHL career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''We didn't help him and that was ultimately the difference,'' Senators defenseman Marc Methot said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Rangers also ended Ottawa's seven-game winning streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Curtis Lazar scored for the Senators as they failed to collect at least one point for just the second time in their past 18 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''They played better than we did from the start and we couldn't really pick it up,'' Senators captain Erik Karlsson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>New York's fifth goal knocked Hammond out of the game late in the second period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''You've got to help out your goaltender, especially with Hammer since he's stood on his head for us for so many games in a row,'' Methot said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hammond was replaced by Chris Driedger, who was making his NHL debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Driedger finished with 10 saves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Rangers took a 3-1 lead into the second period on two goals from Kreider and one from Boyle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Kreider opened the scoring at 12:38 of the first after a fantastic pass from Derek Stepan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Senators tied the game just 19 seconds later when Lazar gained control of a bouncing puck in the Rangers end and beat Talbot with a quick shot from the faceoff circle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Boyle gave the Rangers the lead at 16:40, and with one minute left in the period Kreider got his second goal of the game off a Stepan rebound that bounced straight up after Hammond made the initial save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''I thought it was pretty sloppy for the first 10 minutes or so and then I think both teams did a good job executing the second half of that first period,'' Kreider said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>At 1:42 of the second period, Zuccarello scored on a one-timer for a 4-1 lead before Glass scored at 16:02 just five seconds after emerging from the penalty box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''It's one of many hopefully,'' Glass said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Senators had a 5-on-3 advantage for 34 seconds, but didn't register a shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They had just one shot over the final 86 seconds of the Glass minor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Notes: Jared Cowen, Milan Michalek, Matt Puempel and Craig Anderson were scratches for the Senators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>While Kevin Klein and Martin St. Louis were scratches for the Rangers.</td></tr>
