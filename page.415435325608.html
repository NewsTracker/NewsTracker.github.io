<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iraqi Shiite fighters launch rockets toward Islamic state positions in the center of the city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BAGHDAD - A prominent Iraqi Sunni preacher urged authorities on Friday to prevent Shiite militias from carrying out revenge attacks on Sunnis in Saddam Hussein's hometown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The militias are fighting alongside government forces against Islamic State extremists in Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In his appeal, Sheikh Abdel Sattar Abdul Jabbar cited reports of Shiite militiamen burning Sunni homes in the battle to win back Tikrit from Islamic State hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Abdul Jabbar said that if the government failed to stop revenge attacks by Shiite militias, the country would face reignited sectarian tensions - such as the ones it witnessed at the height of Iraq's sectarian wars in 2006 and 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We ask that actions follow words to punish those who are attacking houses in Tikrit," Abdul Jabbar said during his Friday sermon in Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are sorry about those acting in revenge that might ignite tribal anger and add to our sectarian problems."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Iraqi forces entered Tikrit for the first time on Wednesday from the north and south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Friday, they fought fierce battles to secure the northern Tikrit neighborhood of Qadisiyya and lobbed mortars and rockets into the city center, still in the hands of Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iraqi military officials have said they expect to reach the center of Tikrit within two to three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Iranian-backed Shiite militias have played a crucial role in regaining territory from the Islamic State, supporting Iraq's embattled military and police forces in battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey said Wednesday that as many as 20,000 militiamen may be involved in the ongoing Tikrit operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi last week called on his forces to protect civilians and their property in recaptured areas, vowing zero tolerance for any violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He also called upon Sunnis who may have welcomed the initial onslaught or battled with the militants to give up their support for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I call upon those who have been misled or committed a mistake to lay down arms and join their people and security forces in order to liberate their cities," al-Abadi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Human Rights Watch said Friday that Iraq's Shiite militias have engaged in "deliberate destruction of civilian property" after security forces recaptured the town of Amirli and other areas where the Sunni militants were driven out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In its new report, "After Liberation Came Destruction: Iraqi Militias and the Aftermath of Amerli," the rights group cites evidence that militias looted the property of Sunni civilians who had fled fighting, burned their homes and businesses, and destroyed at least two entire villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile, the commander of the Shiite militias, Hadi al-Amiri, said the U.S. has failed to live up to its promises to help Iraq fight the extremists unlike the "unconditional" assistance being given by Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In a battlefield interview near Tikrit, he criticized those who "kiss the hands of the Americans and get nothing in return."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He warned that Iraq should not sacrifice its sovereignty for the sake of receiving weapons and assistance from the U.S., suggesting the Iraqi government is taking instructions from Washington.</td></tr>
