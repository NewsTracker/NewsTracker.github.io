<h3>Apple Releases iOS 8.4.1 Mystery Update</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Well this is unexpected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Just one week after releasing iOS 8.4 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and moving onto iOS 9 with the first public beta, Apple Apple has surprised everyone by unveiling iOS 8.4.1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Historically such mystery releases have often meant they disable popular jailbreaks like TaiG, though even then this is often hidden among release notes under general terms like "General Performance and Stability Improvements" or "Bug Fixes".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In this case, however, there are no release notes whatsoever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The good news is iOS 8.4.1 (build '12H304') is currently only for developers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This still makes the lack of notes strange (iOS 9 beta 1 has detailed release notes), but it means iOS 8.4.1 will go through several iterations before mainstream users will be expected to upgrade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>By then Apple will surely offer up some information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Consequently what is more interesting to me is that iOS 8.4.1 exists at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple has already publicly stated that iOS 8.4 limitations (notably the lost Home Sharing functionality) will be addressed in iOS 9 and that is already slated for early September alongside the release of the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Given early September is just six weeks away and the average iOS release has over 60 days in beta cramming in another iOS 8 release is strange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple must have decided something is of high priority and with iOS 8.4 bug fixes coming in iOS 9 it means jailbreaking (something not patched in iOS 8.4) very likely to be the top priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Either way the rush to release iOS 8.4.1 makes for a suitable ending to iOS 8, which is already the most updated version of iOS in history. iOS 8.4.1 will number 11 following 8.0, 8.0.1, 8.0.2, 8.1, 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.1.3, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4.</td></tr>
