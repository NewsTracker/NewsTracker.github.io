<h3>Hillary Clinton sets renewable energy goals to spur more wind, solar power</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks at an organizing event at the Reiman Ballroom at the Iowa State University Alumni Center in Ames, Iowa July 26, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>AMES, Iowa Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on Sunday for a dramatic national shift to energy sources such as solar and wind, setting a goal of generating enough clean renewable energy to power every U.S. home within a decade after she takes office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton, the front-runner for her party's 2016 presidential nomination, also pledged to have more than half a billion solar panels installed nationwide within four years of taking office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I want more wind, more solar, more advanced biofuels, more energy efficiency," Clinton said at a rally on Sunday in Ames, Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"And I've got to tell you, people who argue against this are just not paying attention."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The two goals, announced in a video on Sunday night, were the first elements of what Clinton said would be a comprehensive climate-change agenda to be released over the next few months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton has been under pressure from Democratic presidential rival Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-styled socialist who has called for swift action on climate change, and environmental activists anxious to see her spell out details of a climate plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Her campaign said the goals would lead to a 700 percent increase in the nation's installed solar capacity from current levels, and eventually could lead to the generation of at least one third of all electricity from renewable sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clinton also called for extending federal clean energy tax incentives and making them more cost effective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In Ames, Clinton said she would continue the wind production tax credit and recalibrate other tax incentives that are "too heavily weighted ... toward fossil fuels."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clinton also said she would fight efforts to roll back President Barack Obama's executive actions to curb carbon emissions from power plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She said the actions could build a "clean energy economy" that would bolster growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If we start addressing it, we're going to actually be creating jobs and new businesses," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Clinton will discuss the proposals on Monday at an energy-efficient transit station in Iowa, the state that kicks off the 2016 presidential nominating race and is a leading wind energy producer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clinton praised Iowa for promoting wind energy and advanced biofuels, and for establishing state tax rebates for installing solar panels in homes and businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She criticized Republicans who are reluctant to say climate change is a man-made phenomenon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"They will answer any question about climate change by saying: 'I'm not a scientist.' Well, I'm not a scientist either. I'm just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain and I know we're facing a huge problem," Clinton said.</td></tr>
