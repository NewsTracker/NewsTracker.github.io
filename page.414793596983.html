<h3>EU puts 19 more individuals on its Ukraine sanctions list</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) " The European Union has added 19 more individuals, including a Russian deputy minister of defense, on its sanctions list for their actions linked to the fighting in eastern Ukraine, in a move strongly criticized by Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The EU published the list, which also included nine entities, on Monday, one week after the EU foreign ministers decided on the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There was a week's lapse in the publishing of the list because of the negotiations which led to an agreement between Ukraine and Russia last Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The additions bring the total number of individuals hit with a travel ban and asset freeze to 151 while 37 entities are now also hit with restrictive measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Russian foreign ministry reacted angrily, calling it "clumsy" in the context of last week's cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The ministry dismissed the new EU sanctions as "running against common sense" and harming chances "to resolve an internal Ukrainian conflict."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The latest batch includes Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov, an outspoken critic of Ukraine, two more high-level officials linked to the military, and two state Duma officials who backed the annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among the officials from the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, was Iosif Kobzon, who has been supportive of the separatists, and is also well known as a crooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The entities targeted consist of eight armed separatist groups and one Russian movement backing the separatists in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The EU, at the same time, continued to prepare work on a possible extension of economic sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"These measures can be adjusted in a positive or negative way," depending on how the implementation of the peace agreement progresses, said EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A cease-fire in eastern Ukraine went into effect Sunday but on Monday the two sides were accusing each other of violations.</td></tr>
