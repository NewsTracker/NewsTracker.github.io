<h3>'Doubtful' Microsoft will buy Salesforce: Analysts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Despite reports that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is interested in buying Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is still the most likely buyer of the cloud services firm if reports of buyout talks are indeed true, analysts said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shares of Salesforce shot higher Tuesday afternoon amid reports that Microsoft was considering a bid for the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Microsoft declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Salesforce said it does not comment on rumors or speculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Whether Microsoft would make a serious bid, I'm more doubtful. I think Oracle probably makes the most sense," Rick Sherlund, director of technology research at Nomura Securities, said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>No deal is imminent, according to Bloomberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last week, Bloomberg reported that Salesforce hired financial advisors after being approached by potential buyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Industry watchers have since speculated that Oracle is the company behind the initial reported bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sherlund ticked off a list of reasons why Oracle is the more likely suitor: It's a better strategic fit, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff used to work for Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison, and Oracle has excess sales capacity that would help it do a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>FBR Capital Markets' Samad Samana also believes Oracle is the most likely bidder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However, he and Sherlund said a deal would make sense for both Oracle and Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There's not any type of transformative acquisition in the cloud that you can do that's bigger and more marquee than Salesforce," Samana told "Squawk Box."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Microsoft has placed increased emphasis on cloud computing during CEO Satya Nadella's tenure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The company reported last month that its cloud business grew 106 percent year over year in its most recent full quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Nadella last week projected that Microsoft could hit $20 billion in cloud revenue by 2018, a leap from the current annualized rate of $6.3 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Satya Nadella, he has a vision for the cloud," Samana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"They've given analysts a peg out there, and what better way to get there than acquiring Salesforce.com, which would make them an even more robust enterprise application provider?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The acquisition would also block Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), the dominant player in cloud computing infrastructure, from consolidating its lead through a purchase of Salesforce.com's platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Trading in Salesforce was briefly halted around 3 p.m. EDT Tuesday with the stock up 6 percent after Bloomberg reported that the software giant was evaluating a bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Another company previously approached Salesforce about a potential bid, the news service said, citing sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Benioff may not necessarily be ready to sell the company he founded, Samana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I think Marc Benioff has a vision of what he wants to accomplish, and I don't think he's quite done cementing what he wants to do," Samana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Salesforce has a market cap of about $48 billion, compared with Microsoft's roughly $385 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In December, the companies tightened their partnership, making it easier to use Salesforce on Windows Mobile phones and in Office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That close relationship, as well as Benioff's focus on customer experience, could influence his decision on whether to accept a deal, Samana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"If they can be more productive and more valuable with his customers being with Microsoft and more tightly integrated, I think it's something he would certainly consider because at the end of the day, they're a customer company," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Salesforce shares ended Tuesday up 1.6 percent, while Microsoft fell 1.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Shares of Salesforce were up more than 1.5 2 percent in premarket trading Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>(Click here for Salesforce's latest price.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Disclosure: Samana and Sherlund do not own shares of Salesforce.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>FBR Capital Markets holds greater than a 1 percent share in the stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Nomura does not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Neither firms provide investment banking services to Salesforce.com.</td></tr>
