<h3>Half of Vanuatu's population affected by Cyclone Pam: UN</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Severe Tropical Cyclone Pam barrelled into the archipelago a week ago, bringing sustained winds of some 250 kilometres (155 miles) per hour which devastated entire communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Around 166,000 people, more than half of Vanuatu's population, have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Pam on 22 islands," the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a situation report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Food stocks and water reserves are being exhausted and will not last more than a couple of weeks across the affected islands."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The agency said the confirmed death toll had risen to 16, as aid workers were able to reach new areas, with completed assessments covering 15 islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Aid agencies have stressed that potable water, food, shelter and health were a priority in the aftermath of the storm which hit late on March 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The latest assessment found damage to food crops was extensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Coconut and banana plantations have been particularly devastated, which will have significant longer-term impact," OCHA said, noting that most people living on the outer islands grow their own food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In some areas local residents would not only lose their main source of income due to damage to crops such as copra, but their food security would be threatened by the loss of livestock, such as pigs and poultry, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In its situation report, OCHA said that access to some communities was still hindered across the sprawling nation which is made up of more than 80 islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But it said between 50 and 90 percent of local dwellings were estimated to have been damaged by the fierce winds which pounded Vanuatu as the eye of the storm hovered over the nation for hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Around 65,000 people are in need of temporary emergency shelter," it added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Aid agencies have mobilised to help the country, and are on the ground distributing food, water and health services but access to drinkable water is a concern after ground water sources were contaminated by the storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Schools have been postponed for two weeks, and are due to restart on March 30, with OCHA estimating that 500 schools were damaged, something which will affect up to 70,000 children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The agency said fuel stocks were running low across the affected islands while electricity was mostly unavailable and generators are essential.</td></tr>

<h3>Lib Dem peer quits over donor claims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Daily Telegraph reported that Dispatches will allege "a 10,000 donation was paid by the stepfather of an undercover businessman which would be against the rules on donations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Lord Strasburger of Langridge has denied doing anything wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The allegations are due to be broadcast in the Channel 4 programme next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The BBC has not seen any evidence to corroborate what the Daily Telegraph is reporting and neither has it heard from Channel 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Under rules overseen by the Electoral Commission and set out in law, any donation above 7,500 has to be declared and the use of a proxy as a donor - to hide the real giver of the money - is not allowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a statement published by the Liberal Democrats, Lord Strasburger said: "Whatever Channel 4 may say in their Dispatches programme, I do not think I have committed any offence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Having said that, I believe that we should all be accountable for what we do, so I have invited the Electoral Commission to carry out an investigation into my actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"In the meantime, whilst I maintain that I have committed no offence, I have stopped fund-raising for the party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Also, for the sake of the party, I have resigned the whip from the Liberal Democrat group in the House of Lords until the investigation is completed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a response to a suggestion in the Daily Telegraph that this apparent donor, working for Dispatches, had met the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, a spokesman for the party said: "It is common practice for senior party figures from all parties to meet with potential and current donors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The statement adds: "Dispatches has raised important questions about one particular donation, which the party is taking seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The party had no reason to believe that the donation was made by anyone other than the person who signed the cheque."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lord Strasburger, 68, from Bath, is a semi-retired businessman who took his seat in the House of Lords as a life peer in 2011.</td></tr>
