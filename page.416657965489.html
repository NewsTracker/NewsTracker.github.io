<h3>The Latest on Nepal: Hospitals Coping Well, No Outbreaks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nepal is renewing its appeal to international donors to send tents and tarpaulins for temporary shelter along with grain, salt and sugar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The government also asked donors to send money to help with relief efforts if they cannot send things that are immediately necessary after last weekend's devastating earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have received things like tuna fish and mayonnaise. What good are those things for us? We need grains, salt and sugar," Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat told reporters Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mahat said the government has decided to exempt taxes on tents and tarpaulins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Information Minister Minedra Risal said Nepal would immediately need 400,000 tents and so far has only been able to provide 29,000 to the people who need them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A European Union official says some 1,000 Europeans in Nepal had not reached out to their embassies since the powerful earthquake there over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The EU's Ambassador to Nepal Rensje Teerink told reporters Friday that "of course doesn't mean they are dead. It just means they haven't reported back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Most of the people not accounted for were tourists and trekkers and it's near impossible to keep track because most do not register with their embassies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.N. humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos told reporters at the U.N. compound in Nepal's capital that aid workers face "immense logistical challenges" trying to get aid to mountainside villages where helicopters couldn't land and where some roads were destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Amos saw some of the isolated Himalayan villages by air Friday during her visit to the country hit by an earthquake April 25 that caused more than 6,200 deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Of course we are worried that it is taking so long to get to people who desperately need aid. Some of those villages are virtually flattened. But it's very, very hard to see how we're going to get to them," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While the helicopters could deliver aid to places within walking distances that would do little to help the injured who need to get to hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nepalese leaders and outsiders were working to get aid to those in need.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the scale of the devastation, she said, would challenge any government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The U.N. humanitarian office says more than 130,000 houses were reported destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The World Health Organization says a quick assessment of Nepal's worst-hit districts has found some hospitals damaged or destroyed but most are coping well with no extra staff or beds required.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>However, they are in need of essential medicines, equipment and materials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The WHO says the Nepalese health system took measures to prepare for such emergencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The agency says it is focused on preventing the possible spread of diarrhoeal diseases among at least 2.8 million displaced people, especially those living in 16 makeshift camps in Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>So far, the number of cases has not exceeded expectations and no camps have reported an increase in disease or any outbreaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A day after two people were pulled alive from underneath the earthquake rubble, Nepali rescuers in orange jumpsuits and wearing masks and hardhats are working amid piles of debris - bricks, broken slabs of concrete, wooden floorboards, a mangled ceiling fan.</td></tr>
