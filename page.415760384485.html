<h3>#ParkingFail: Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton may need to work on her parking skills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Norton, 77, was seen exiting her vehicle Wednesday morning, which was parked awkwardly in an angled parking spot on Capitol Hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Norton, a 12-term Democrat representing Washington, D.C., in Congress, pulled straight in to the spot, coming very close to each vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some congressional staffers who witnessed the parking fail Wednesday morning laughed at the display.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the video, Norton appears to rub up against each vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A visual inspection hours later showed that neither vehicle parked on either side of Norton appeared to sustain any body damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sources say Norton left her car in the spot for about 30 minutes before returning to move it, leaving a business card on the windshield of the Nissan Extera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The Congresswoman heard from the owner of the only car she was close enough to damage. The owner reported no damage," a spokesperson for Norton said.</td></tr>
