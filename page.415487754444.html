<h3>Ferguson police shooting suspect arrested, charged</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- A 20-year-old man charged Sunday with shooting two police officers watching over a demonstration outside the Ferguson Police Department had attended a protest there earlier that night but told investigators he wasn't targeting the officers, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said suspect Jeffrey Williams told authorities he was firing at someone with whom he was in a dispute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're not sure we completely buy that part of it," McCulloch said, adding that there might have been other people in a vehicle Williams is accused of firing from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Williams is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>McCulloch said the investigation is ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The police officers were shot early Thursday as a late-night demonstration began to break up following the resignation of Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson in the wake of a Justice Department report that found widespread racial bias in the police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He was out there earlier that evening as part of the demonstration," McCulloch said of Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But several activists who've been involved in the protests since the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer told The Associated Press they were not familiar with Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Williams used a handgun that matches the shell casings at the scene, McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He also said tips from the public led to the arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Williams, who St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said is black, is being held on $300,000 bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he didn't know whether Williams had an attorney or when he'd appear in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A message left at the St. Louis County Justice Center was not immediately returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters - who also hadn't heard of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"This is a fear tactic," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, "I don't know him. I've never seen him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Williams, a north St. Louis County resident, was on probation for receiving stolen property, McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I think there was a warrant out for him on that because he had neglected to report for the last seven months to his probation officer," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Online state court records show a man by the name of Jeffrey Williams at the address police provided Sunday was charged in 2013 with receiving stolen property and fraudulent use of a credit/debit device.</td></tr>
