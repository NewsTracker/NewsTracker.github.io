<h3>Netanyahu rejects French-led Palestine peace plan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) has shown disdain for France's proposed peace-deal, during the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius' (left) visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected "international dictates" of a French-led UN resolution laying out parameters for peace talks with Palestine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, on a two-day visit to the Middle East, urged Israel not to prejudge his efforts and warned of the dangers of continued stalemate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Fabius wants to see the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which collapsed in 2014, relaunched through an international support group comprising Arab states, the European Union and UN Security Council members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Netanyahu, in public remarks to his cabinet, said the international proposals did not take into account Israel's security needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In the international proposals that have been suggested to us - which they are actually trying to force upon us - there is no real reference to Israel's security needs or our other national interests," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They are trying to shunt us toward indefensible borders, ignoring what will happen on the other side," he said, referring to his often-stated argument that militants would take over areas vacated by Israel unless strong security arrangements were negotiated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The only way to reach agreements is through bilateral negotiations [between Israel and Palestine], and we will firmly reject attempts to force international dictates on us," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His remarks, made hours before he was to host Mr Fabius, were widely interpreted in Israel as directed at France's proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The only way to reach agreements is through bilateral negotiations [between Israel and Palestine], and we will firmly reject attempts to force international dictates on us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Fabius sought to respond to such concerns after his meeting with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, saying France would avoid imposing a solution "that no one would accept".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We must both guarantee Israel's security and at the same time give Palestinians the right to have a state," Mr Fabius said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Fabius said the conflict could be "set ablaze" if there was no movement toward peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>France has so far focused with Arab states on a possible UN Security Council resolution that would set negotiating parameters and establish a timeframe, possibly 18 months, to complete talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki voiced support for the French initiative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"[Palestinians] need a commitment from the major powers and those with a direct interest," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In December, the United States voted against a Palestinian-drafted resolution calling for an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and the establishment of a Palestinian state by late 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But this month, US president Barack Obama said the absence of a peace process and the conditions raised by Mr Netanyahu for Palestinian statehood would make it hard for Washington to continue to defend Israel at the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Netanyahu sparked international concern when he ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state while campaigning for the March 17 general election, though he has since backtracked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Meanwhile, Mr Fabius said it was still not clear whether a world powers deal could be reached on Iran's nuclear program by a June 30 deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In bilateral talks, Mr Netanyahu urged Mr Fabius to stand firm on an agreement that Israel has criticised for not guaranteeing Tehran will not obtain a nuclear bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Fabius said any nuclear deal with Iran must be verifiable as he prepared to meet his Iranian counterpart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We think that we must be extremely firm and that, if an agreement is to be reached, that agreement must be robust," Mr Fabius said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>European foreign ministers will meet their Iranian counterpart Mohamed Javad Zarif on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Iran and the P5+1 powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - agreed in April on the main outlines of what would be a historic agreement scaling down Tehran's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Some have argued that a window of opportunity may arise after the conclusion of the Iran talks for France to submit a resolution at the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They argue that the United States would be unlikely to support moves beforehand that could impact negatively on the nuclear negotiations.</td></tr>
