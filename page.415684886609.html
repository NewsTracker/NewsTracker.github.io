<h3>Clashes rage in Ukraine coastal town, threatening ceasefire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Government and Russian-backed separatist forces face off against one another across an unseen line cutting through the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>To reach rear-guard government positions in the seaside town of Shyrokyne, Ukrainian soldiers gingerly wind their off-roaders through private gardens hugging a precipice along the Azov Sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The truce announced in mid-February has never taken here, so traveling by the main roads is too dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Government and Russian-backed separatist forces face off in daily gun and artillery battles across an unseen line cutting through the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The skirmishes are fierce, but contained - for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Still, the enduring unrest arouses deep anxieties that a conflict which has already claimed more than 6,000 lives in eastern Ukraine could flare up again across the entire 450-kilometre front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shyrokyne itself is not much of a prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is the industrial port city of Mariupol, 10 kilometres further west, that Ukrainian forces want to defend from the rebels at all costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Residents and government troops alike believe the separatists' ultimate aim is to take Mariupol - and eventually create a land bridge between Russia and Crimea, which Russia annexed last March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Crimea has no physical link to Russian territory now and a bridge being discussed is years away from completion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Government forces in Shyrokyne are only truly at ease behind three defensive lines separating them from the heat of fighting in the center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At a makeshift garrison installed there, on the grounds of a restaurant near the shore, two tanks stood parked Sunday under a striped awning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fighters of the Azov Battalion play chess during a break in the town of Shyrokyne, eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The truce announced in mid-February never made it here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As reports came that two enemy tanks had been spotted, Al's thoughts turned to the combat ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It is all about to start," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>To proceed closer to the area where the battle is fiercest, soldiers abandon their cars and race on foot toward a school, climbing through a hole in the fence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The asphalt on the road had been torn up by explosives, so only armored vehicles could get through with ease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The responsibility for defending Shyrokyne is shared between the Azov and Donbass battalions, who take weekly turns to serve in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Coordination is sometimes poor, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>As Azov troops jogged for cover behind the school Sunday, one soldier shouted: "What are you doing? Are you crazy running like that? There are booby traps there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Another soldier corrected him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Nah, the booby traps are over there," he said, waving his hand vaguely to the left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The Donbass guys put them there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Inside the school, children's drawings still decorated the walls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>One man fried sausages and another chowed down on boiled oats as a mobile phone blared out music by a Russian death metal band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Underfoot, amid the spent bullet cartridges and shrapnel, students' art collages lay covered in fallen plaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>As the sound of mortars grew more intense, all the men ducked inside for cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"There they go, they've started again," said an Azov spotter with the nickname Mathematician.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A ceasefire between Ukrainian and rebel forces was forged after marathon negotiations between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France on Feb. 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Under the truce, fighting was supposed to stop and heavy weapons were to be pulled back from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Responsibility for verifying the cease-fire lies with monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Mathematician said the rebels always wait for the OSCE teams to leave before resuming their attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"As soon as the OSCE leaves, the firing starts," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Separatists accuse Ukrainian forces of similar deviousness, and it's hard to know definitely even at the front line who started any specific round of firing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The head of the OSCE monitoring mission on Monday demanded that his teams be granted secure access to Shyrokyne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Fighters of the Azov Battalion observe enemy lines from the roof of their base in the town of Shyrokyne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Both sides in this area continue to violate numerous provisions of the (cease-fire) agreements, including those related to cessation of fire, prohibition of attacking moves, withdrawal of heavy weapons, and deployment of (airborne drones)," said Ertugrul Apakan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Later on Sunday afternoon, sounds resembling outgoing mortars could be heard from a nearby field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Soldiers refused to give an AP reporter access to the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"We don't have any mortars," Mathematician said, smiling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"They only allow us to have small arms. But when they (rebels) get really brazen, we call in support and flatten them."</td></tr>
