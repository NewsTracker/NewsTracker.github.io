<h3>Judge puts AG's attempt to investigate Google on hold</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JACKSON, Miss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - The Mississippi attorney general's attempt to investigate Google is on hold for at least four more months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate on Monday granted Google's request for a preliminary injunction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The order prevents Attorney General Jim Hood from going through with a subpoena meant to examine whether Google is facilitating illegal activities by others on its sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Internet giant, based in Mountain View, California, argued that Hood's investigation is blocked by a 1996 federal law, the Communications Decency Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It gives Internet services immunity from lawsuits over what third parties say using the services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Wingate said that, at this point, Google has the stronger argument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, Hood says he wants to investigate Google's own conduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Wingate set the case for further arguments later this year.</td></tr>
