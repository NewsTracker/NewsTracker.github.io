<h3>Notre Dame dodges early exit in 69-65 win over Northeastern</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Irish held on, though, because they could hold on to the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Zach Auguste scored 25 points, Jerian Grant added 17 and Notre Dame dodged a scare trying to erase its futile NCAA Tournament history with a 69-65 win over Northeastern on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Fighting Irish (30-5) will play the winner of Texas-Butler on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I told them in the locker room, we weren't going to beat them by 15," coach Mike Brey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"So don't anybody walk out of here feeling we should have won by 15."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The third-seeded Irish were fortunate to even win by 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Irish returned to the tournament after a one-year absence determined to build off their ACC Tournament title and make a Final Four run in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Colonial Athletic Association champion Huskies played with the 40 minutes of grit needed to avoid a crushing defeat like so many other double-digit seeds throughout tournament history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the Huskies finally collapsed with sloppy play over the final minutes that ended the upset bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The final possession was the costliest one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Huskies chased down the loose ball after an inbound pass was wildly thrown away by the Irish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Out of timeouts, Northeastern passed the ball five times on its final game-tying possession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Zach Stahl frantically waved his arms when he fought his way open under the basket, yet no teammate saw him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Quincy Ford coughed up the ball - and ended the Huskies' last-gasp effort at pulling off the shocker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Auguste, who made 10 of 14 shots, sealed it with two free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The clutchest free throws of his career," Notre Dame forward Pat Connaughton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Huskies are left wondering if they could have won had they not burned their timeouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It would have helped if we would have had one more timeout," forward Scott Eatherton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I think we could have really got a play in. I'm not really sure what happened at the very end."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Irish have traditionally struggled in the tournament under Brey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They made only one Sweet 16 since 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Northeastern (23-12) gave the Irish fits and threatened to keep Notre Dame's March malaise going.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Eatherton had 18 points and David Walker had 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>All those fans that love rooting for the double-digit seeds to play spoiler in March had to be rooting for Northeastern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But the Huskies were sloppy late, finishing with 16 turnovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Irish made only seven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Eatherton was in a perfect spot on the block and put back a missed 3 to make it 67-65 with 32.5 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Even with foul trouble, he came up big down the stretch for the Huskies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Eatherton pushed forward with four fouls and his layup at the 2-minute mark made it 65-61, inching the Huskies closer to their first NCAA Tournament win in more than 30 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Grant, though, picked Ford clean and went all the way for a dunk that made it 67-61.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>But each time the Huskies got close, they couldn't finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>They failed in a great shot at taking the lead midway through the second half when they missed two easy taps at the basket trailing by nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Grant grabbed the loose ball, went around his back and midcourt and dished to Auguste for a thunderous baseline dunk that brought the Notre Dame fans to their feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Northeastern was fired up from tip as it chased a small slice of March history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Walker pounded his chest in exultation after his 3 on the second possession and the Huskies never let Notre Dame's lead grow to more than five points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"I didn't think there was any fear factor going into the game," Northeastern coach Bill Coen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Walker's second 3 of the half evened the score at 18-all and the Huskies positioned for a 14 seed to win a game for the third straight season.</td></tr>

<tr><td>43</td><td>... Guard Demetrius Jackson took a stiff hit to the face late in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"I'll be fine for the game," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"It was difficult to see during the game."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Led by Eatherton's eight rebounds, Northeastern held a 33-17 edge on the glass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Auguste led the Irish with just five rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Northeastern: Will return next season without Eatherton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Notre Dame: The Irish will play either Butler or Texas on Saturday at Pittsburgh's Consol Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Notre Dame head coach Mike Brey yells to his team during the first half against Northeastern in a second round game in the NCAA college basketball tournament, Thursday, March 19, 2015, in Pittsburgh.</td></tr>

<h3>Ebola outbreak: Sierra Leone to lock down hotspots next week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Residents in the country's remaining Ebola hotspots will be confined to their houses for three days next week, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Residents in Sierra Leone's remaining Ebola hotspots will be confined to their houses for three days next week, officials said, as the government tries to snuff out an outbreak that has killed more than 10,200 people across West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The number of Ebola cases in the region has fallen in recent months, though a spike in Guinea highlights the risk of complacency, over a year into the worst outbreak on record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sidi Yaya Tunis, an official at Sierra Leone's National Ebola Response Centre, said health officials would carry out house-to-house searches from March 27 to 29 to identify the sick in the north and west, where the virus is spreading fastest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Elsewhere, where transmission is lower, officials will focus on education and prevention, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Health officials said a previous lockdown in Sierra Leone in September was a success and helped identify more than 100 cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If we don't get on top of this before the rains come, it will be a horror show," said a Sierra Leone health official who asked not to be named because the details of the lockdown have not been made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Many people are still not following the basic rules."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The rains are due to begin in May. The World Health Organization has said they could greatly complicate the fight against Ebola by washing away roads and making it harder for aid and health-care workers to get to affected areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The official said that residents would be allowed out to attend church on Palm Sunday for a few hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The latest figures issued by the WHO showed that there had been 10,216 confirmed, probable and suspected deaths from Ebola in West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Regional leaders have set themselves a target to completely stamp out the disease by mid-April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ebola outbreaks in Nigeria, Mali and Senegal have been contained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Liberia has recorded the most deaths with 4,283 since the crisis began, according to the WHO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, there are currently no confirmed cases in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sierra Leone has been the next worst affected country with 3,702 dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Guinea, where the outbreak was first identified, has recorded 2,231 confirmed and probable deaths from Ebola but has seen a recent spike, with the number of patients more than doubling since last month.</td></tr>
