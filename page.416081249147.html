<h3>Apple Watch pros and cons: What reviewers are saying</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The standard version will start at $699 and the high-end "Edition" watch (above) will be priced from $13,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple Inc's smartwatch is a "beautiful", "stylish" and "elegantly made" piece of technology that could make life easier for people on the move, reviewers said, but it also has shortcomings and a price that could limit its appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The watch, the first new product to be launched by Apple under Chief Executive Tim Cook, will hit stores on April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"For now, the Apple Watch is for pioneers," the Wall Street Journal's Geoffrey Fowler wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I won't pay the $1,000 it would cost for the model I tested, only to see a significant improvement roll in before too long."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Most reviews, while praising the watch's sleek design, highlighted its relatively short battery life - up to 18 hours, according to Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The fact that it relies on an iPhone being close for most of its functions to work was also seen by some reviewers as a drawback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Paired with an iPhone, the watch allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apps will also allow users to track their health - for instance by tracking heartbeats and the number of steps a person takes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fowler said the battery was often nearly drained by the end of the day, especially if used during exercise, while CNET's Scott Stein said recharge time was slow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Re/Code's Lauren Goode said that while the watch's battery life was not nearly as long-lasting as some other wearable devices, it was better than she had expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple is among several large tech companies hoping to jumpstart a new market for wearable electronic devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The standard version will start at $699 and the high-end "Edition" watch will be priced from $13,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"...If you can tolerate single-day battery life, half-baked apps and inevitable obsolescence, you can now wear the future on your wrist," Fowler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>CNET's Stein said Apple wants people to see the Apple Watch as "fine jewelry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Maybe that's a stretch, but in terms of craftsmanship, there isn't a more elegantly made piece of wearable tech."</td></tr>
