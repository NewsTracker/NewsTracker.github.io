<h3>Hundreds of Thousands March to Ask Brazil President's Ouster</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Protests have been called for across Brazil to demonstrate against President Dilma Rousseff, whose popularity has never been lower as she faces a sputtering economy and a massive corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians marched peacefully Sunday in more than 150 cities around the country to demand President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment and to criticize government corruption amid a sprawling graft inquiry at state-run oil firm Petrobras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The biggest of the protests, held on the 30th anniversary of Brazil's return to democracy after a long military regime, took place in Sao Paulo, an opposition stronghold where some 210,000 gathered on a main avenue, according to the polling institute Datafolha, one of the only entities in Brazil that makes scientific crowd estimates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Large rallies were also seen in the capital Brasilia, the southern city of Porto Alegre and in Rio de Janeiro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are here to express our indignation with the government-sponsored corruption and thieving, and to demand Dilma's impeachment," said Andre Menezes, 35, protesting on Avenida Paulista in Sao Paulo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"She may have not been directly involved in the corruption at Petrobras, but she certainly knew about it, and for me that makes her just as guilty and justifies her ouster," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In Rio, police estimated 15,000 people marched along the golden sands of Copacabana beach, where they waved Brazilian flags and many openly called for a military coup to dissolve the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I don't want my country to turn into a Venezuela, we don't want an authoritarian government!" said Marlon Aymes, 35, helping carry a 20-foot long banner that read in English: "Army, Navy and Air Force. Please Save Us Once Again of Communism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We want the military to dissolve Congress and call new elections, because the level of corruption is too widespread to do anything else," Aymes added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In contrast to the widespread violence seen during Brazil's 2013 protests, on Sunday the only conflict reported was police using tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a small group of protesters in Brasilia who authorities said were trying to enter the Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In Sao Paulo, police arrested about 20 young men who were carrying powerful fireworks and brass knuckles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Rousseff didn't appear in public on Sunday, but her Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo went on national TV to hold an extensive live press conference defending the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He emphasized that Rousseff would soon propose a series of anti-corruption measures in Congress that were promised during her re-election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He also defended the leader's record as a leftist guerrilla who stood up to Brazil's 1964-85 military regime - and who was jailed for three years and brutally tortured because of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Rousseff has said she fully supports peaceful demonstrations, even those demanding her impeachment, and Cardozo added Sunday night that the rallies "confirm that Brazil is a democratic state that allows for divergences, the existence of opposing opinions and that we're far from any coup option."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Much protester ire was focused on a kickback the scheme at Petrobras, which prosecutors call the biggest corruption scandal ever uncovered in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At least $800 million was paid in bribes and other funds by the nation's biggest construction and engineering firms in exchange for inflated Petrobras contracts.</td></tr>

<h3>Suspect charged in shooting of Ferguson, Missouri, police officers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Williams is the 20-year-old suspect in the shooting last week of two police officers during a protest rally in Ferguson, Missouri, has been arrested and charged with first-degree assault and gun violations, prosecutors said on March 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FERGUSON, Missouri - A 20-year-old man was charged on Sunday with first-degree assault in last week's shooting of two policemen during a protest rally in Ferguson, Missouri, a crime that shocked a city that has been devastated by months of racial strife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The suspect, Jeffrey L. Williams, has admitted to firing the shots that wounded the officers early on Thursday, said St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The gunfire rang out just after midnight at the end of a rally to call for sweeping reforms in Ferguson, where an unarmed black 18-year-old was shot to death by a white officer last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Michael Brown's death touched off months of protests against law enforcement's treatment of minority groups, in Ferguson and around the country, and led to a U.S. Justice Department probe that found pervasive racial bias on the part of the city's mostly white police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Williams was arrested after a massive manhunt, with the help of tips from the public and video evidence, McCulloch told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An African American who had been on probation for possession of stolen property, Williams told investigators that he was not targeting police but was shooting at someone else, McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound and a 32-year-old from a nearby police department sustained a facial wound in Thursday's shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both were treated and released by a local hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Williams, whose bond was set at $300,000, appears to have fired a .40-caliber handgun from a car, McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A lawyer for Williams could not immediately be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A handgun was recovered in his residence and matched shell casings found at the scene, according to McCulloch, who said that although Williams appeared to be the only shooter, other people may be charged as the investigation continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This arrest sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated," U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The shootings took place just hours after Ferguson's police chief resigned in the wake of the scathing U.S. Justice Department report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chief Tom Jackson's resignation followed the departures of the city manager and a municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The extent to which Williams may have been involved in street demonstrations remains unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>McCullough said Williams may have participated in protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Several long-time activists said they did not recognize or know Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>One frequent protester, Bishop Derrick Robinson, told local media that he had spoken to Williams early on Sunday and said the shooting had nothing to do with the protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Robinson said Williams had told him that he had been robbed earlier that night, and had returned to the area and shot his gun in the air out of frustration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"He told me that he shouldn't have done it," Robinson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"He was embarrassed. He showed deep remorse. He wishes he could retract things."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>News of Sunday's arrest was greeted on the streets of Ferguson with a mix of relief and a sense that the protests would not fade away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I just hope they got the right guy, and that he gets what he deserves," said Gussie Klorer, a 60-year-old professor at St Louis University, adding she thought the arrest would have no bearing on the street demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The protests seem to have a life of their own," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But the news also prompted a show of support for Ferguson's beleaguered police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Dozens of people gathered in front of police headquarters, many of them holding signs reading "We Support the Badge" and "Thank You Police."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>There was a brief clash on Sunday between the pro-police demonstrators and about 15 people who converged on them shouting "you support baby killers", while one among them trampled and ripped an American flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The two groups met in the middle of the street, face to face, and began shouting at each other, though tensions cooled after the pro-police group disbanded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Justice Department report said Ferguson police overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to black residents to boost city coffers through fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That helped create a culture of distrust that exploded in August when city police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown.</td></tr>
