<h3>Suicide Bomber Strikes Near Ancient Temple in Luxor, Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Sunday, Nov. 30, 2014, file photo a tourist has her picture taken at the ruins of the Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Egyptian officials say a suicide bomber has blown himself up at the ancient temple of Karnak in Luxor, a southern city frequented by millions of foreign and Egyptian tourists every year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Militants tried to attack the ancient temple of Karnak in southern Egypt on Wednesday, with a suicide bomber blowing himself up and two gunmen battling police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>No sightseers were hurt in the thwarted assault, but it suggested that Islamic extremists are shifting targets from security forces to the country's vital tourism industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The violence left the bomber and one gunman dead, the other wounded and arrested, and four other people wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The temple was not damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The attackers carried guns in backpacks, and one wore a belt of explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They rode in a taxi through a police checkpoint to a parking lot and sat at a cafe and ordered lemonades, witnesses told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The taxi driver, suspicious after they refused his offer to help with the packs, alerted police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When a policeman approached, the bomber tried to hug him, but the policeman wrestled away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Seconds later, he detonated the explosives, and the others pulled automatic weapons from their bags and opened fire wildly, sending a small group of European tourists running for cover, the witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The attack followed one this month outside the famed Giza Pyramids in which gunmen killed two policemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The violence points to a change in tactics by Islamic militants against the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For two years, attacks have been centered in the Sinai Peninsula, mostly by a group that has sworn allegiance to the Islamic State group and largely focused on retaliation against police and soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A campaign against tourism, one of the main sources of foreign revenue, could deal a blow to el-Sissi's promises to repair Egypt's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tourism has just started to show signs of recovery after plunging in the turmoil since the 2011 uprising that ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The first five months of this year saw tourism revenues up 9 percent from the same period last year, Tourism Minister Khaled Ramy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ramy said he expects the slow recovery to continue despite the attack, and he underscored how police had thwarted it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Security forces were there. It's a very important message to everyone," he told the AP on a flight from Cairo to Luxor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mohammed Sayed Badr, the governor of Luxor province, said the attack was "an attempt to break into the temple of Karnak."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But witnesses noted it was civilian bystanders who alerted police to the threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Karnak, one of Egypt's biggest attractions, is a giant complex of temples, statues, obelisks and columns built by pharaonic dynasties alongside the Nile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The oldest sections date back nearly 4,000 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Access to the site is through a gate and a roadblock, leading to a parking lot and visitors' center hundreds of yards from the ancient structure, which is reachable only on foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The waiter who served the men said only one spoke to him and had an accent from northern Egypt, while the others stopped talking when he approached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>When they paid their bill, he said he refused to take their tip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"They looked scary. ... One of them had really bad eyes," said the waiter, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Ikrami, for fear of problems with police for talking to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Another cafe employee, Abdel-Nasser Mohammed, said the taxi driver reported his suspicions about the men to police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>As the three walked away, a policeman approached them, leading to the tussle between the officer and the bomber, Mohammed said.</td></tr>
