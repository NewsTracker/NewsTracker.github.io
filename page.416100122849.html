<h3>Suge Knight Fires His Robbery Case Lawyer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He is charged with murder in a separate case, in which prosecutors said he ran down two men with a pickup truck at a Los Angeles area burger stand on 29 January, killing one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Comedian Katt Williams, 43, is also charged in the robbery case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>During a hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court, Knight did not give a reason for making his request to replace his lawyer, David Kenner, when Judge Ronald Coen asked him if that was what he wanted to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Is Kenner fired?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Judge Coen later asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Kenner is fired," Knight said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Kenner, who has a long history of working with Knight, was not present during the court hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Knight has until 27 May to find a new lawyer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The 49-year-old has complained about his health in previous court hearings and was rolled into Wednesday's hearing in a so-called safety seat which he was not happy about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He complained to the judge and said he could walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If you can walk, you can walk. It won't happen again," Judge Coen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He added that Knight had previously complained of paralysis on one side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Outside of court, lawyer Matthew Fletcher, who consulted with Knight during the hearing on Wednesday and represents him in the murder case, said the safety chair was unnecessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Come on, this is getting to the point of abject humiliation," Mr Fletcher told reporters after the hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said he did not expect to represent Knight in the robbery case.</td></tr>
