<tr><td>3</td><td>Trader Gordon Charlop works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, June 29, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Stocks closed with their biggest losses of the year as investors worry about fallout from Greece's worsening debt crisis.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Brazilian real was knocked back hard these past days as have the Turkish lira and most other emerging Asian currencies. These associations are made to Greece as they fall under the labeling of global emerging markets."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A series of events over the weekend has left Greece perilously close to defaulting on its debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Greek leaders pulled out of talks with creditors that include European nations and the International Monetary Fund and called a referendum that's likely to determine if Greece stays in the euro common currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the vote set for Sunday, the government is urging Greeks to vote against its creditors' proposals, arguing that they are humiliating and that they would prolong the country's financial woes.</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>If Greece defaults and switches to a new currency, it's sure to shake global financial markets.</td></tr>

<tr><td>36</td><td>Things have changed since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The European Central Bank is also ready to swing into action to prevent a panic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The ECB has already committed to buying 60 billion euros a month in corporate and government bonds to push down interest rates and help the European economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>It could buy even more, and flood financial markets with cash, to calm jittery European investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude was down 14 cents at $58.19 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</td></tr>
