<h3>Is Apple Music unfair to competition? FTC investigates</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Is Apple Music unfair to competition?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) playing dirty with competitors such as Spotify?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>U.S. antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission are looking into claims that the tech giant's treatment of rival music-streaming apps is illegal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple just launched Apple Music, a streaming service to compete with the likes of Spotify, Rhapsody, Pandora, Jango and a host of other services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But industry sources complain that Apple's policies give the company's new music service an unfair advantage, according to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The FTC is studying the issue but has not launched a formal investigation, sources told the news service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>So what's the beef with Apple?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Apple's App Store provides a major selling platform for its competitors, but the company takes a 30% cut of all in-app digital purchases, such as music subscriptions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Most music-streaming services, including Apple's own, charge $9.99 per month for unlimited access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, Apple's cut either takes a large chunk of its competitors' profit margins or forces the competition's prices higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Companies do not have to sell their services on Apple, and Apple can charge any fee it wishes for transactions within the App Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Although it is legal to have a monopoly, it is not legal to use a monopoly to vanquish competitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The FTC is also looking into Apple's prohibition on certain types of advertising within the app, according to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Consumers could sign up for any streaming service via a web browser, but many consumers don't know about that option, believing that the only way to access music-subscription services is through the Apple App Store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Apple bans advertisements that let consumers know a service is available on other platforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The tech company also has a ban on linking to a company's website from within the app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While those restrictions apply to all apps, the music-streaming services see this as a particularly harsh blow to their business model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This isn't the first time Apple has been accused of keeping the competition down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.S. Department of Justice won its case at the end of June against Apple for colluding with publishers to keep the price of e-books artificially high to compete with Amazon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The company is also under investigation by U.S. attorneys general in New York and Connecticut over whether it pressured music labels into favoring its new service, according to The New York Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And the European Commission is investigating Apple's negotiations with music labels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The FTC is looking into whether Apple has been leveraging its power within the music business to make favorable deals.</td></tr>
