John Kelly, who heads the U.S. Southern Command, has said Iran and Islamic extremist groups were doing a "fair amount" of recruiting in the region, and said some people have become radicalized through the Internet and others through radical mosques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent U.N. report said the number of fighters leaving home to join al-Qaida and the Islamic State group has spiked to more than 25,000 from over 100 nations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
