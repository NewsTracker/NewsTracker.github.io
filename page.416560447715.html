<h3>Compromise GOP budget hikes war funds, targets 'Obamacare'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - House and Senate GOP negotiators are sealing agreement on a budget blueprint that would enable Republicans to more easily target the Affordable Care Act while delivering an almost $40 billion budget boost to the Pentagon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The emerging plan drops a controversial House proposal to radically overhaul the Medicare program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And, it eliminates the option of using a fast-track budget bill to target food stamps and Pell Grants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the plan relies on deep cuts to domestic agency budgets and safety net programs for the poor to promise a balanced budget by 2024.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The measure is not yet finalized, but congressional aides familiar with its outlines say it'll likely made official Monday or Tuesday and be ratified by House and Senate votes this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record while talks are ongoing.</td></tr>
