<h3>Maryland deals Princeton its 1st loss 85-70 in NCAA tourney (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Backed by the President and toting an unbeaten record, Princeton provided the women's NCAA Tournament with a very good story line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That book is now closed, courtesy of top-seeded Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Laurin Mincy scored 27 points, and the Terrapins used a second-half blitz to knock off Princeton 85-70 Monday night and advance to the Sweet 16 for the fourth consecutive year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After leading by only 42-38 at the break, Maryland used a 17-2 run immediately after halftime to turn a surprisingly tight game into a rout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Terrapins (32-2) will bring a 26-game winning streak into a matchup with Duke on Saturday in Spokane, Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Maryland and Duke were longtime rivals in the Atlantic Coast Conference before the Terps moved to the Big Ten this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>President Barack Obama cheered for the Tigers (31-1) on Saturday in their tournament opener and picked the Ivy League champs to beat Maryland, in part because his niece plays at Princeton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And the Terrapins?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Well, the Big Ten champions were beginning to feel a bit overlooked in this second-round matchup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''Coming in, playing an undefeated team, a team that Obama had picked over us, it gave us some added motivation to come in and make a statement,'' Mincy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That didn't come until the second half, after Maryland struggled through a lackluster opening 20 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After the teams exchanged baskets, Mincy scored in the lane and Jones sank two free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Jones and Shatori Walker-Kimbrough then made successive baskets before Mincy drilled a 3-pointer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Field goals by Brown and Malina Howard completed the run, making it 59-40 with just under 14 minutes to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''I really felt like in that stretch we just wore them out,'' coach Brenda Frese said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Lexie Brown scored 23 for the Terrapins, who reached the Final Four last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Eighth-seeded Princeton was coming off the program's first-ever win in the NCAA Tournament, on Saturday against Wisconsin-Green Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Tigers hoped to make a statement against one of the nation's elite teams, and for a half, they hung right in there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the second half, however, Maryland went 7 for 8 beyond the arc and shot a blistering 56 percent from the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''They came out really fired up and they were making their shots,'' Princeton forward Alex Wheatley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''I mean, they shot 87.5 percent from 3 in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Blake Dietrick led Princeton with 26 points and Vanessa Smith added 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Princeton made 10 of its first 13 field-goal tries and led 28-24 on the Terrapins' own floor before an enthusiastic crowd that clearly favored the home team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Outscoring Maryland 28-6 in the paint while holding center Brionna Jones without a point in the first half, Princeton had several leads before falling behind at the break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Jones had 22 points and 12 rebounds Saturday against New Mexico State, but she was not a factor in this one until the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Ultimately, Maryland proved to be too fast, too big and, most importantly, too talented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''It's an honor to play a team like Maryland, because they're so consistently good,'' coach Courtney Banghart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Jones finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Mincy, in her final home game, went 9 for 11 from field, including 6 for 7 from beyond the arc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Despite coming up short in this one, the Tigers proved they have big-time drawing power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Although Obama wasn't here, this game attracted Supreme Court justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, both of whom graduated from Princeton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Princeton: The players on the greatest team in Princeton history walked off the court with their heads held high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''What this team did was, they made history,'' Banghart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''All you want to do in your life - and I told them that - is to leave a legacy and to do something of impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Maryland: Mincy was sensational in her final home game, capping a season in which the Terps went 17-0 at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''She plays her best basketball in March, when the stakes are the highest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>She wants the moment,'' Frese said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Princeton: The Tigers are 1-5 in the NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>... Princeton went 4 for 17 from beyond the arc after firing at a 40 percent clip during the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>... After trailing at halftime only once during the regular season, Princeton trailed at the break in both games in this tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Maryland: Five Terrapins scored in double figures, including Walker-Kimbrough with 10 and Tierney Pfirman with 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>... This was only the second time the schools have met.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Maryland won 76-52 in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Maryland: Seeking a berth in the Elite Eight for the third time in four years, the Terrapins face Duke on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Princeton: Season over.</td></tr>
