<h3>Police called after John Kitzhaber and fiancee Cylvia Hayes seen dumping trash in landfill</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>John Kitzhaber, who resigned as the state's governor last week, and his fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, were seen at the Knott Landfill Site in the city of Bend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With federal investigators looking into the scandal that forced Kitzhaber to quit, employees alerted authorities after the pair paid a visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kitzhaber bowed to pressure following months of news reports alleging Hayes used her relationship with him to land clients for her consulting business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Deschutes County sheriff's deputies poked through the couple's trash for about an hour, Timm Schimke, director of the county's solid waste department, told the Bend Bulletin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Knott Landfill is located just outside Bend, where Hayes owns a home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'They looked like any other people who were cleaning out their garage or cleaning out a rental.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was just stuff,' Schimke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'They weren't manipulating the stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Their trash included old campaign signs for Hayes, who ran for the Legislature more than a decade ago, and a mattress or box spring, Schimke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kitzhaber resigned last week under pressure over Hayes' work for advocacy groups with an interest in state policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Federal authorities are investigating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kitzhaber has denied the couple did anything wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'It just seemed strange that they were at a transfer station dumping waste so soon after him resigning and them being under investigation,' Schimke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Darryl Nakahira, legal counsel at the Sheriff's Office, is forwarding all questions and requests for information to the FBI, which doesn't respond to inquiries involving ongoing criminal investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hayes - at the center of an ethics scandal that forced the resignation of Gov. John Kitzhaber - has launched a legal fight to keep her private emails out of the public eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The lawsuit came to light Thursday, the same day that Oracle Inc., the tech giant that built Oregon's botched health insurance exchange, filed a lawsuit against several of Kitzhaber's former campaign advisers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The company accuses Kitzhaber's advisers of orchestrating the abandonment of the Cover Oregon website to help his re-election effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Oracle also served notice that it may sue Kitzhaber and his former chief of staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The flurry of lawsuits keeps alive two controversies that weighed on Oregon's once-popular governor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Hayes, who is engaged to marry the former Democratic governor, filed a lawsuit Wednesday against The Oregonian asking a judge to rule that she is not required to turn over her emails to the newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She's resisting an order from the state Department of Justice that says emails from her private email accounts that concern state business must be provided to The Oregonian, which requested them under the state's public records law.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt sentences Mohamed Badie and members of Muslim Brotherhood to death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mohamed Badie was one of 14 members sentenced to life, alongside his deputy Khairat El-Shater and leading Brotherhood figure and lawmaker Mohamed El-Beltagy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Badie and Mr El-Beltagy both showed their defiance at the verdicts, gesturing behind the heavy screens of their cages to cameras in the Cairo courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Leading Muslim Brotherhood figure Mohamed el-Beltagy gestures from the defendants' cage during his trial at the non-commissioned police officers institute in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Egyptian policemen stand guard in the courtroom in front of the cage holding the defendants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The case stemmed from clashes near the group's headquarters on June 30, 2013, four days before the ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fighting left 11 people dead and 91 wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The men were accused of murder and possession of firearms, among other charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other key figures sentenced to life include party head Saad el-Katatni and his deputy, Essam el-Erian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Four lower-level members of the Brotherhood were sentenced to death for inciting the violence in June 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Two of those sentenced to death and three sentenced to life were tried in absentia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The death sentences are subject to appeal and many of the defendants are already serving lengthy sentences on other charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Once the top leader of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, Badie has already been sentenced to multiple life terms, and was one of hundreds given the death sentence in a mass trial that drew international criticism of Egypt's judicial system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some 22,000 people have been arrested since Morsi's ouster, including most of the Brotherhood's leaders, as well as non-Islamist activists swept up by police during protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who as army chief toppled Morsi, describes the Brotherhood as a major security threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The movement says it is committed to peaceful activism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The same day another Egyptian court listed the Palestinian group Hamas as a terrorist organisation, judicial sources said, part of a sustained crackdown on Islamists in the most populous Arab state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hamas is an offshoot of the Brotherhood, which the authorities have also declared a terrorist group in Egypt and have repressed systematically since the coup against Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While a court ruled in January that Hamas' armed wing was a terrorist organisation, Saturday's broader ruling against the entire group has potentially greater consequences for the already strained relationship between Cairo and Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip on Egypt's border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'The Egyptian court's decision to list the Hamas movement as a terror organisation is shocking and is dangerous, and it targets the Palestinian people and its factions of resistance,' Hamas said in a statement after the ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'It will have no influence on the Hamas movement,' Hamas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After the January decision against Hamas' Qassem Brigades, a source close to the armed wing signalled the group would no longer accept Egypt as a broker between it and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Cairo has for many years played a central role in engineering ceasefires between Israel and Hamas, including a truce reached between the sides in August that ended a 50-day Gaza war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A spokesman for the Egyptian government declined to say what actions the government would take to enforce the ruling.</td></tr>
