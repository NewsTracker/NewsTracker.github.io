<h3>Three British teens stopped en route to Islamic State as battle for Tikrit stalls</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ankara: Three British teenagers who had been planning to join Islamic State militants in Syria have been detained in the Turkish city of Istanbul, Turkish and British officials said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The three, who have not been named, were detained on Friday, Turkish sources told Reuters, after a tip-off from British authorities that two of them were travelling to Turkey via Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Iraqi Shi'ite militants rest near the front line with Islamic State in Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Their detention comes after three British schoolgirls entered Turkey last month and are thought to have joined Islamic State in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police in London said they had been made aware that two 17-year-old boys had gone missing and were thought to be travelling to Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Further inquiries revealed they had travelled with a 19-year-old male, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Officers alerted the Turkish authorities who were able to intercept all three males, preventing travel to Syria. They remain in detention in Turkey. The families have been kept informed of developments," the police statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Arrangements were being made with British authorities to deport all three back to the UK, a senior Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Security services estimate some 600 Britons have gone to Syria or Iraq to join militant groups, including the man known as 'Jihadi John', who has appeared in several Islamic State beheading videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The British government plans to ban airlines from taking Britons to join Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hundreds of other Europeans are also fighting for the militants, with a 13-year-old boy last week reported as having become the youngest foreigner to die for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The involvement of foreign fighters has raised fears about the possibility of attacks at home if they return trained and further radicalised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Turkey meanwhile has faced criticism for not better controlling its south-eastern borders, and has accused European countries of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from travelling in the first place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Also on Sunday, Islamic State fighters traded sniper fire and mortar rounds with Iraqi troops and allied Shi'ite militia forces in the city of Tikrit amid reports the militants had used chlorine as a chemical weapon elsewhere in the country earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A military official returned from the front in Tikrit said no major advances were made by either side nearly two weeks into an operation to win back the city Islamic State fighters seized last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Iraqi Kurdish authorities said on Saturday they had proof the radical Islamist militants occupying large parts of the country's north and west used chlorine against Kurdish peshmerga fighters in January in a car bombing attempt west of the city of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Baghdad government official reached by Reuters on Sunday declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But the mayor of a town on the northern edge of Tikrit told Reuters that storage containers filled with chlorine were found by troops and mainly Shi'ite militiamen when they entered al-Alam last week, the day before they fought their way into Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We found a number of storage units containing chlorine that we think were seized by Daesh from water purification stations in different parts of Tikrit," Laith al-Jubouri said, using the Arabic acronym for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said security forces had sealed off the area where the containers were found and alerted Baghdad authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>On Tuesday, when Iraqi forces and allied militias pushed Islamic State fighters out of the town, a Reuters photographer was present when Iraqi police instructed journalists to stand back and hold their breath as they detonated a roadside bomb they suspected contained chlorine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>When they detonated the bomb, a yellowish plume burst into the air, and as bystanders coughed, officials shouted "be careful, it's chlorine!", the Reuters photographer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The military campaign to retake Tikrit has been stalled since Friday, when security officials said Iraqi forces and their militia allies would wait for reinforcements before moving forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Two days later, back-up had not yet arrived, and officials continued to stress the challenges they faced in flushing out militants in street-by-street battles and defusing bombs and booby traps they laid while retreating from parts of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"There were no new pushes today from either side, only scattered skirmishes in the northern and southern parts of the city," Colonel Mohammed Abid al-Jubouri told Reuters by phone after visiting the southern edge of Tikrit on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Jubouri said the process of "organising troops and waiting for reinforcements" was ongoing and did not say when a fresh effort to seize the central districts of the city still held by Islamic State would begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The militants still hold about half the city, which lies about 160km north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The effort to retake Saddam Hussein's home city from the militants who overran it last year has been the biggest offensive yet against the group that has declared an Islamic caliphate on territory it controls in Iraq and neighbouring Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Though Sunni residents of areas near Tikrit recently freed from the militants' grip continued to return home on Sunday in trucks carrying white flags, fears remain that sectarian tensions will again rise to the fore after the battle for Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The growing weight of the Shi'ite militias and Iran further weaken the Iraqi state's credibility and structures as well as the standing of local elites" in Sunni areas north of Baghdad like Tikrit, said Maria Fantappie, Iraq analyst at the International Crisis Group.</td></tr>
