<h3>Philippine volcano ejects ash, but no violent eruption</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MANILA, Philippines (AP) - A Philippine volcano has spewed ash for the second time in less than a week but there were no signs of any eminent violent eruption, the country's chief volcano expert said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon province southeast of Manila ejected ash 250 meters (825 feet) above the 1,565-meter (5,165-foot) volcano late Wednesday, said Renato Solidum, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The agency asked local officials to keep people away from a 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) hazardous zone around the crater, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said aircraft should not fly close to the mountain to avoid any sudden explosions and ash clouds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Solidum said the explosion was due to ground water coming into contact with hot rocks and not rising magma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He says such "phreatic" explosions are typical of Bulusan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The ash explosion lasted about 3-1/2 minutes, shorter than the 5-minute explosion recorded May 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A large explosion in February 2011 that shot an ash plume about 2 kilometers (more than a mile) into the sky prompted about 1,200 villagers to flee to shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bulusan is one 23 volcanoes considered active by the volcanology agency, but it has not had a violent eruption since in 1918.</td></tr>
