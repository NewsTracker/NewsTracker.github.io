<h3>Shoppers return to Kenya's Westgate mall nearly two years after terrorist attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Customers enter the reopened Westgate shopping mall on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nairobi: It was the site of a mass killing and a national embarrassment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But when Westgate mall reopened on Saturday morning, shoppers and politicians poured through the security scanner into the glittering, light-filled interior in a rare moment of hope and closure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ben Mulwa, 34, a survivor of the September 2013 terrorist attack in the Kenyan capital that left at least 67 people dead, was among the first five to escape after hiding in a flower bed as four terrorists walked by him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Their calm, expressionless faces haunt him to this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He was one of the first to return Saturday, coming, he said, "to finish that business that brought me to Westgate mall", a lunch meeting with a friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>September 2013: policemen take cover near the main entrance of the Westgate shopping mall during the attack that killed at least 67 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Today is an inspirational moment for us," Mulwa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Many people didn't make it, as we did. Today, we are excited because we are back on our feet, and we can convince the world that terrorism is not bringing us down any time soon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The assault was carried out by the four gunmen who passed Mulwa by.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The militants from the Somali group al-Shabab launched a siege that dragged on for days, with initial fears that their numbers might be greater and dozens of people might be held hostage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The gunmen freed those who could recite the Islamic profession of faith and shot down others, including children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The attack underscored how terrorists could inflict a devastating toll on a soft civilian target, without the need for suicide vests, explosives or bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A young Kenyan girl and her brother play on the floor while other shoppers walk around the reopened Westgate Shopping Mall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Al-Shabab's attack on a university in the northern Kenya town of Garissa in April used the same template, with a small group of gunmen storming student residences, shooting Christians and even taunting parents and loved ones on their victims' mobile phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At least 148 died in the assault, which came after authorities failed to heed protests about poor security on the campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Westgate mall, once Nairobi's most elite shopping spot, was closed after the 2013 attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Its hulking empty frame conveyed not only the country's security failures in its battle against al-Shabab but was a grim reminder of other unpleasant moments: police officers looting stores left empty after the gun battles; authorities offering misleading statements - some called them downright lies - during the crisis; the squabbling between arms of the security forces that stymied the response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mulwa, a communications consultant, had been driving into the mall's rooftop parking garage when the first shots came.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He abandoned his car, blocked from behind, its motor still running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>September 2013: an armed policeman searches for gunmen during the attack at the Westgate shopping mall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The shots went on so intensely that we had to get out of our cars," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I went to hide in a flower bed on the way to the rooftop. While I was hiding, I saw the terrorists walk through the entrance. They shot at me. I remember the particular shot that grazed my head. The bullet ricocheted off the wall and hit my leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"They shot the security guard who was right in front of me. He died in front of me because he was shot in the head."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The faces of the killers are still locked in Mulwa's mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Shoppers visit the reopened Westgate mall on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Josephine Kinotei, 34, was working at the Healthy U food outlet in the Nakumatt supermarket and was trapped for hours in a washroom before Kenyan forces rescued her and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We were terrified," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We couldn't leave because people were still shooting. We started praying and praying. We prayed a lot."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A security guard walks past a wall mural depicting US President Barack Obama in Nairobi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Kinotei lost several close friends in the attack, and for months was troubled with images of the dead that haunted her dreams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Yet she did not hesitate to return to work Saturday: "This is my first time to come back here. All we are praying for is peace: peace in this mall and peace in our country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Security was heavy at the reopening, with army and police vehicles on site and guards patrolling with hand-held radios.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Inside, staff at a health-food shop held candles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The event came less than a week before US President Barack Obama's planned visit to Kenya, when he will underscore American support for the war against al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>US drone strikes have killed a series of top Shabab commanders in Somalia in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The reopening of the Westgate comes ahead of an official visit by US President Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But al-Shabab appears to have gained strength within Kenya in the last year, mounting a series of deadly attacks, mainly on the coast and in the north-east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>And despite the heavy protection offered at Westgate on Saturday, security at many malls and other soft civilian targets remains lax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Early this month, 14 people were slain in the northern town of Mandera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Security analyst Mwenda Mbijiwe said unless security was improved at the Israeli-owned mall, "there will be another attack here. Terrorists are not stupid. They will come to check it out. They will want to put a nail in the coffin. This is an Israeli facility. They will want to shame them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Security is high in Kenya for Barack Obama's long-awaited visit.</td></tr>
