<tr><td>9</td><td>Early surveys put her well ahead of any challenger for the Democratic nomination and with an edge against most Republican rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clinton will hope to solidify that support and gee up her core supporters and donors for the long road ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rallies are the cornerstone of American political campaigns, festooned with the button pins, bunting and banners that are quintessential of the razzmatazz of the trail.</td></tr>
