<tr><td>6</td><td>"The Champions League is a different competition altogether. You never know if it's an advantage playing the second leg at home.

<tr><td>13</td><td>"In the quarter-finals, all the teams are strong and PSG are a strong team, very strong and it's going to be difficult for us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Barca, who overcame Manchester City 3-1 on aggregate, are on track for a treble of Liga, Copa del Rey and the Champions League trophies as their high-flying side ride on the crest of a streak that has seen them win 17 of their last 18 matches.</td></tr>
