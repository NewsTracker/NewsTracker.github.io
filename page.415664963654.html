<h3>Shockers beat Jayhawks 78-65 in NCAA Tournament showdown (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- The boys from Wichita State had been hearing it in text messages from friends, and on social media from total strangers: Don't let the chance to stick it to Kansas slip away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Shockers would never dream of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Finally getting a chance to play the school that continually spurns them, Fred VanVleet and the rest of the Missouri Valley champs rolled to a 78-65 victory over the second-seeded Jayhawks on Sunday, earning a trip to the Sweet 16 in the sweetest way possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''There's so much to be said about this rivalry with Kansas,'' VanVleet said, ''but really, it's all about the fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Shockers have tried for years to schedule a game against Kansas, but the dominant school in the Sunflower State has always refused, arguing it would have nothing to gain from it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After the beating they got Sunday, it's no wonder the Jayhawks never want anything to do with Wichita State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tekele Cotton scored 19 points for the seventh-seeded Shockers (30-4), and VanVleet finished with 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Evan Wessel hit four 3-pointers and scored 12, helping his team advance to Cleveland for a Midwest Regional semifinal against third-seeded Notre Dame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''We don't have McDonald's All-Americans, we don't have guys that have been in the spotlight, and been given that pedestal,'' VanVleet said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''We work for everything we've got, from managers to coaches to our preacher to, you know, whoever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They didn't stop on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If anything, they scrapped harder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''We'd been playing anybody else, it would have meant the same, advancing to the Sweet 16,'' Kansas coach Bill Self said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Devonte' Graham and Perry Ellis had 17 points each, and Frank Mason added 16 for the Jayhawks (27-9), who blew an early eight-point lead and never really threatened in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As the final seconds ticked away, VanVleet started riling up an already boisterous section of Shockers fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And when the game ended, coach Gregg Marshall strode across the floor with a wry smile on his face, reaching out to shake hands with several of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The buzz for the first meeting since 1993 between the schools separated by just 162 miles began to build on Selection Sunday when it first became a possibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But by the time the Jayhawks beat New Mexico State and the Shockers had survived Indiana, it had grown to a deafening roar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Shockers, who had seven turnovers total against the Hoosiers, had that many in the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kansas fouled so often that Wichita State spent more time in the bonus than getting there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>VanVleet was driving to the rim when his elbow caught Ellis' nose, sending the Wichita native sprawling to the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Red droplets started sliding down his chin, and Ellis retreated to the locker room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>When he returned, he had wads of cotton stuffed up his nostrils.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Jayhawks were leading 24-16 at that point, but the Shockers pounced on their opportunity with Ellis off the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They didn't allow another field goal for the final 6 minutes, going on a 13-2 closing kick that gave them a 29-26 lead at the break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Led by the calm, cool play of VanVleet at the point, and with Wessel knocking down just about every 3-pointer he tried, the Shockers had an answer for every salvo from the Big 12 champs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>When the Jayhawks scored four quick points to trim their deficit to 63-55 with 6 minutes to go, Wichita State broke their full-court press and Darius Carter breezed in for layup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''We didn't play very smart,'' Self said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Self had burned through all of his timeouts by that point in the game, trying in vain to turn the momentum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>And as the final few minutes ticked away, all those Shockers fans that felt slighted by their Kansas counterparts began to cheer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''I'm speechless,'' Cotton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>When asked whether he kissed away any chance of playing Kansas on a regular basis, Marshall replied: ''Who knows?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>They may want to play now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>I have no idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>I'm not worried about that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>I'm fine letting the series lay the way it is right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Wichita State: Ron Baker had 12 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Carter finished with 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>... The Shockers snapped a five-game skid against Kansas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>... Wichita State has won at least 30 games three straight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Kansas: Wayne Selden Jr. was scoreless, going 0 for 5 from the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>... Mason had five turnovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>... Kansas lost for the first time in six NCAA Tournament games in Omaha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Wichita State heads to Cleveland to play No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>3 seed Notre Dame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Kansas begins thinking about next season.</td></tr>
