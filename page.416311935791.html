<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Friday will spend $2.5 billion to build a new generation of fuel-efficient engines and transmissions in Mexico, creating 3,800 jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ford said it will build a new engine facility within its engine plant in the northern state of Chihuahua.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The facility will build a new gasoline engine that will be exported to the United States, Canada, South America and the Asia-Pacific region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Production of Ford's I-4 and diesel engines at the Chihuahua plant will also be expanded, making it the biggest engine plant in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company said it will also build a transmission plant in the central state of Guanajuato, in partnership with German transmission maker Getrag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the Guanajuato plant would have the capacity to produce up to 800,000 units per year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ford's announcement, confirming an earlier Reuters report, is the latest in a recent series of auto investments in Mexico, as carmakers are drawn to the country's cheap labor, free trade agreements, and proximity to the United States.</td></tr>
