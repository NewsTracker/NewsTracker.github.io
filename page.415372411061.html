<h3>Ferguson city manager resigns after probe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police Chief Thomas Jackson's resignation will take effect immediately or on 19 March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The resignation is the latest in a string of departures since the findings of the Justice Department probe were announced on 4 March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Protesters have called for his removal since the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager last summer, which led to the Justice Department report that found widespread racially biased practices in his department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The death of Michael Brown, 18, set off a national furore over police use of deathly force that has continued to reverberate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During weeks of protests over Mr Brown's death, Chief Jackson's department floundered in attempts to calm things down, and state and county law enforcement took over the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jackson would follow Ferguson City Manager John Shaw, who resigned this morning, and Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer, who quit on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last week, three police department employees were fired for offensive emails cited in the Justice Department report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chief Jackson has commanded the police department since he was appointed by the city manager in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The department has a total of 54 sworn officers divided among several divisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Attorney General Eric Holder said last week the Justice Department would use its full authority to reform the police department, including possibly dismantling it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Justice Department report detailed numerous incidents of routine harassment of African-American residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The report said the department was more focused on revenue raising than public safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This emphasis on revenue has compromised the institutional character of Ferguson's police department, contributing to a pattern of unconstitutional policing," the Justice Department report said.</td></tr>
