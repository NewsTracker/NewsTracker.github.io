<h3>Merkel seeks to dampen talk of 3rd Greek bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS (AP) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the president of the European Union's executive branch cautioned Wednesday against speculation that Greece will need a third financial bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Though Greece's new left-wing government has insisted it won't seek another bailout, the debt-strapped country could need some form of assistance to see it beyond the summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece and its creditors recently agreed a four-month extension to Athens' second bailout to June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Merkel said "we have our hands full" implementing that agreement and "that's what I am concentrating on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said after meeting Merkel it is "premature" to speculate about another program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In Athens, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis poured cold water on the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I don't know who said this, or who presented all this as a debate, even using specific sums. This is as far from the truth as it can get," he said late Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Monday, Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said that a third package was being negotiated, though his ministry said after he spoke that a third bailout was "hypothetical."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>De Guindos later said Greece will need a new accord or program if it does not regain access to market financing by June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He has said Greece could need as much as 50 billion euros ($56 billion) in further assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greece is pressing bailout lenders to reduce its debt load with more generous repayment terms that would effectively write off a portion of its debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Varoufakis said he believed lenders were taking a tougher line with his government that the previous conservative administration in Greece and other bailed out eurozone members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The powers that be in Europe have decided that this government needs to be treated less leniently than others. It is my considered opinion that this is a political choice," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I hope this is an aberration and that this government is the leeway that it deserves given our commitment to reform Greece."</td></tr>
