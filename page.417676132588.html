<tr><td>4</td><td>The game lets players select a prompt from a word list so they can illustrate it by using multiple colors on a white canvas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Users then share the image with their friends who can replay them and reply with their own drawing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The game also offers coins that can be used to unlock additional game content such as other colors and words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Facebook began by rolling out several other apps for Messenger that focused on GIFs, stickers and memes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Now, the social network will focus on expanding its features and integrate games just like its competitor messaging apps do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apps such as WeChat, Line and Viber all have hosted games in their service to enhance the way family and friends communicate.</td></tr>
