<h3>Greece closes in on bailout deal possibly within the day</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) " Greece has more or less concluded its bailout discussions with international creditors, officials said Tuesday, raising hopes that the country could be ready to finalize a deal within the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I think we are very close," Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said as he emerged Tuesday morning from all-night talks with negotiators representing Greece's creditors at a central Athens hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Two or three very small details remain," he added, without elaborating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Similarly upbeat remarks came from government aide Theodoros Mihopoulos, who said on Twitter that the negotiation had been completed and that "some details remain."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece's government is hoping to push the new 85 billion-euro ($93 billion) three-year agreement through parliament this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It needs a deal by Aug. 20 at the latest, when the country has a debt repayment of a little more than 3 billion euros to make to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greece won't be able to make that payment without funds emerging from the country's third bailout in just over five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, many in the ruling left-wing Syriza party are voicing their opposition to the deal, which would see the imposition of further spending cuts among a series of austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Figures next week are set to confirm that Greece's recession deepened in the second quarter as concerns over the country's euro future dented confidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Greece has relied on international bailouts worth a total 240 billion euros ($263 billion) since it lost market confidence and was unable to borrow from anyone else in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To secure funds from the bailouts, successive governments have had to implement a series of spending cuts, tax hikes and reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While the austerity has reduced budget overspending, the measures compounded a deep recession and fuelled record high unemployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Though the radical left-led government was elected on a staunchly anti-austerity platform in January, it has been forced into a policy U-turn after bailout talks came close to collapse last month.</td></tr>
