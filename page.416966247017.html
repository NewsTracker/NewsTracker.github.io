<h3>CANNES WATCH: Naomi Watts resplendent in feathers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Feathers helped the Cannes Film Festival take flight on the opening-night red carpet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Naomi Watts, who appears in Gus van Sant's festival entry "The Sea of Trees," wore a powder blue gown from Elie Saab Couture's spring-summer 2015 collection, its top festooned with sequins and pearls above a flowing feathered skirt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Not to be outdone, Julianne Moore wore a silk gauze column dress by Georgio Armani Prive, adorned with aqua and black Swarovski embroidery and paired with a black feathered top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The flame-haired actress, who won Cannes' best-actress prize last year for "Maps to the Stars," offset the look with bold emerald earrings.</td></tr>
