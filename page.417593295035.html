<h3>US backs fresh Israeli strikes on Gaza Strip</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israeli police explosive experts are photographed in a sunflower field where a rocket landed near Ashkelon in southern Israel on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jerusalem: The United States has defended Israeli air strikes on a Hamas training facility on the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday, the second such attacks in a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Israeli military says the air strikes were in response to a rocket fired from the Hamas-controlled territory and other ongoing rocket incursions across the border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The militant rocket landed in open ground and caused no damage or injuries, the army said, Photographs released by Reuters claim to show the rocket landed in the middle of a farmer's sunflower field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israeli soldiers during a military exercise in the region bordering the Gaza Strip on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest, accompanying President Barack Obama at a G7 summit in Germany, told reporters the White House continued to support Israel's 'right to defend itself'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Clearly the US stands with the people of Israel as they defend their people and their nation against these kind of attacks," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An Israeli army spokesman's statement said the air strike was aimed at "terror infrastructure in the Northern Gaza Strip. Hits were confirmed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However it said no casualties had been reported in Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Demonstrators on the compound known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City on Friday marked the 48th anniversary of the 1967 Middle East war, when Israel captured East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Golan Heights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sporadic rocket fire from Gaza in recent weeks has broken a lull in cross-border violence since a 50-day Israeli war against Hamas ended with an Egyptian-brokered truce last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Air raid sirens sounded throughout Ashkelon, a city about 10km north of Gaza with a population of about 120,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A Jihadist Salafi group, the 'Omar Brigades', sympathisers with Islamic State, claimed responsibility for firing the rocket at Ashkelon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It also claimed the previous recent firings at Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The group said the rocket aimed at Ashkelon was in solidarity with Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, and their own members incarcerated in Hamas-controlled jails in Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The Jews will never enjoy security and safety as long as we are alive," the group said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Meanwhile, a far-right ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged world powers on Sunday to recognise Israel's 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights, saying Syria no longer functions as a country that could reclaim the strategic plateau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The remarks by security cabinet minister Naftali Bennett appeared aimed at capitalising on global debate over how to handle Syria's de facto break-up during a four-year-old insurgency, as well as at undermining support for Palestinian statehood on other land Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I call on the international community: stand with us, recognise Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights now," Mr Bennett said in a speech to the Herzliya Conference, an annual Israeli policy forum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Borders are changing daily. Syria, as a state, no longer exists. So this is the time for initiative."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Past US-backed Israeli-Syrian peace efforts were predicated on a return of the Golan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>With President Bashar al-Assad having now lost swathes of Syria to jihadi rebels like Islamic State, Mr Bennett argued Israeli hawks had been vindicated in opposing any territorial handover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It's clear that had we listened to the world and given up the Golan, ISIS (Islamic State) would be swimming in the Galilee," Mr Bennett said, referring to the northern lake that is a key Israeli water source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Israel has publicly straddled the fence on Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It sees Assad's decline as irreversible, but it worries about his reinforcement by Iran and Hezbollah guerrillas from neighbouring Lebanon, and the prospect of unbridled chaos if Damascus falls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Syrian crisis has vexed Washington, and will be high on the agenda of a visit to Israel this week by the top US military officer, General Martin Dempsey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Frankly, no one knows what to do about Syria. We're hearing out our allies on this, so that's what Dempsey will do in Israel," one US diplomat said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mr Bennett's party is one of the bigger partners in Mr Netanyahu's rightist coalition government, but the two have clashed over whether Israel should revive peace talks with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Unlike the premier, who has moderated his public views since ruling out a two-state solution during the recent presidential elections, Mr Bennett is explicitly opposed to a Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and favours annexing parts of the territory heavily settled by Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>On Sunday, Mr Bennett said Israel should quadruple Jewish settlement on the Golan within five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The current number of Jews there, 23,000, is roughly the same as Druse Arabs loyal to Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's office declined comment on Bennett's speech.</td></tr>
