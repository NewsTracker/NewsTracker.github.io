<h3>New fears over Greece send shockwaves through debt markets</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Financial markets have been shaken up by renewed fears of a Greek sovereign default after reports that Athens had made a private request to delay a repayment to the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek three-year bond yields leapt 200 basis points to 26.44 per cent after reports of the request broke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Meanwhile the country's effective 10-year borrowing costs rose 60 points to 12.5 per cent - underscoring concerns that the country will be unable to meet its near-term liabilities, and could yet crash out of the single currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The news also helped drive safety-seeking investors further into German Bunds, with the yields on 10-year German sovereign debt falling 2 basis points to 0.085 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The nine-year Bund yield turned negative at one point in trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Where's the money for Greece debt payment coming from?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Philippe Gudin at Barclays said: "We believe that the probability of a Greek exit is higher now than it ever was."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Athens is rapidly running short of cash and its eurozone partners are holding out on making a 7.2bn ( 5.2bn) bailout payment until they see convincing evidence that the government, led by Alexis Tsipras, is serious about implementing far-reaching structural reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There are also substantial payments due to the European Central Bank in July and August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, denied the reports that it had informally requested a delay as "downright false".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, insisted that there could be no leeway in any case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Payment delays have not been granted by the board of the IMF in 30 years" she told reporters in Washington at the Fund's spring meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Eurozone leaders are due to discuss releasing Greece's funds at a meeting in Riga next Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schauble, earlier this week suggested that there was little chance of a deal by then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Nobody expects that there will be a solution" he said, speaking in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There was another blow for Athens this week when the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded its sovereign debt to CCC+ with a negative outlook - further into junk status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>S&P cited the lack of progress in Athens' negotiations with its eurozone partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Despite the set backs Mr Tsipras told Reuters he was "firmly optimistic" of reach an agreement with eurozone creditors by the end of April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In a statement, the Greek Prime Minister said several points of agreement had been found since talks first started, especially on areas such as tax collection, corruption and distributing the tax burden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>However, he did acknowledge that the two sides disagreed on major issues ranging from labour rules, pension reform, a hike in value-added taxes and privatisations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Despite the cacophony and erratic leaks and statements in recent days from the other side, I remain firmly optimistic that there will be an agreement by the end of the month" Mr Tsipras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Ten-year German Bund yields have fallen rapidly from 0.5 per cent at the start of this year, having been pulled down by the European Central Bank's bond buying programme - designed to pull the single currency area out of deflation.</td></tr>
