<h3>Hear Speedy Ortiz's Catchy New Song 'The Graduates'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Like first single "Raising the Skate," the new track finds the foursome retreading the off-kilter, hypercatchy pop-rock that made their previous LP, 2013's Major Arcana, a critical favorite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On the new track, the vocal layers are more ornate, the storytelling more elaborate and the instrumentation richer and more complex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The group's penchant for lovable-loser subject matter persists: "I was the best at being second place, but now I'm just the runner-up," frontwoman Sadie Dupuis laments of the love interest with whom she was a "French Club drop-out" and then a "law school reject."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The track incorporates grunge grunge riffs that, when combined with Dupuis' audible situational frustration, sound ripped from the Nineties underground - not exactly sugary but still an undeniable earworm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Though "The Graduates" is slower and more self-deprecating than "Raising the Skate" - which found Dupuis declaring, "I'm not bossy, I'm the boss" - when taken in tandem, the two new tracks reveal a flashier side of Speedy Ortiz than the one that made Major Arcana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Foil Deer follows up last year's four-song Real Hair EP, and is set for release on April 21st; "The Graduates" is available for instant download with any iTunes pre-order of the album.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Speedy Ortiz kicks off a nationwide tour on April 22nd in Boston.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>A Boston College law professor tells The Associated Press that the defense's opening statement sets the tone for their approach to the marathon bombing trial: They want to spare their client from the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Robert Bloom is a former prosecutor who isn't involved in the bombing case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He tells the AP on Wednesday that defense attorney Judy Clarke is trying to keep jurors sympathetic to Tsarnaev and maintain a good relationship with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Bloom says the defense will likely use every opportunity to show Tsarnaev was influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He says prosecutors will methodically lay out the horror of the attacks in court and will want to make the crime "so unsympathetic that the jury will want the death penalty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The manager of a store near where the first bomb exploded on the day of the 2013 Boston Marathon has choked back tears while recalling the smell of burned hair and the sight of blood.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>His voice trembled as he described the moments after an explosion shattered a window and people came streaming inside, many of them wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He says: "I heard a voice of someone saying, 'Stay with me. Stay with me. "</td></tr>

<tr><td>42</td><td>Judy Clarke says: "It was him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>She says the only thing the defense disagrees with prosecutors about is "why."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Clarke calls the bombings a "series of senseless, horribly misguided acts carried out by two brothers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>But she portrayed brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev as the ringleader, saying he planned it and "enlisted his brother into these series of horrific acts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Tamerlan died in a shootout with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Clarke says: "The evidence will not establish and we will not argue that Tamerlan put a gun to Dzhokhar's head or that he forced him to join in the plan, but you will hear evidence about the kind of influence that this older brother had."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>A prosecutor says Tsarnaev's motive for the Boston Marathon bombing was to reach paradise by claiming victory in a holy war against Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said Wednesday in opening statements that Tsarnaev "acted like he didn't have a care in the world" after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>He says Tsarnaev hung out with friends while victims learned their limbs would have to be cut off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The prosecutor described how 8-year-old Martin Richard stood on a metal barrier with other children so he could see the runners.</td></tr>

<tr><td>55</td><td>Tsarnaev's trial has begun with opening statements from the prosecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Weinreb said Wednesday that Tsarnaev carried a bomb in a backpack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The prosecutor says: "It was the type of bomb favored by terrorists because it's designed to tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle."</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Tsarnaev had no reaction and continued to look straight ahead - not at the jury, not at the prosecutor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Weinreb continued: "The air was filled with the smell of burning sulfur and people's screams."</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Jurors deciding Tsarnaev's fate have been sworn in and are listening to preliminary instructions from the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Before the jury was brought in, Judge George O'Toole Jr. granted a prosecution motion to limit the amount of evidence the defense can present about the relationship between Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, during the guilt phase of the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Tamerlan died during a gun battle with police days after the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>O'Toole says some evidence of the brothers' interactions will be "inevitable," but most should be reserved for the second phase of the trial, when jurors will decide whether Tsarnaev receives the death penalty or spends the rest of his life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Tsarnaev is sitting alone at the defense table as his lawyers and prosecutors huddle at a sidebar with the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>After a few moments, a member of his defense team goes to sit next to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Tsarnaev's hair is still untamed and curly, and he has a scraggly goatee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>He's wearing a gray suit jacket and slacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>The judge has formally denied the fourth change-of-venue motion filed Monday by the defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers had acknowledged their three earlier requests were denied but said they wanted to complete the record of their opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>They have argued their client couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts because of the publicity of the case and the proximity to the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Victims of the Boston Marathon bombing have arrived at court for opening statements in Tsarnaev's trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Two busloads of people hurt in the bombings arrived at the federal courthouse at 7:30 a.m. Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>They entered through a side entrance, away from reporters and photographers gathered at the main entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Marc Fucarile (FYOO'-kuh-rihl) went in the front entrance but did not comment to reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>He lost a leg in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Lawyers for Tsarnaev have made it clear they will try to show that he was influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan, who died following a shootout with police days after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Prosecutors say Dzhokhar was an equal and willing participant in the plot that killed three and hurt more than 260.</td></tr>
