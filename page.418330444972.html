<h3>It breaks my heart to see Greece grow so impoverished</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>I was born in Athens 48 years ago, but left the country at the age of 17 to study and build my businesses abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Recently, on one of my trips back to the Greek capital, I got a rude shock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The contrast between the land I had left and the Greece of today is heart-wrenching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The fallout is clear to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When the banking system collapsed in Cyprus, where both my parents were born, my philanthropic foundation set up a &#x201c;Food from the Heart&#x201d; initiative, handing out a free lunchtime snack to the needy in Nicosia and Limassol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The idea I would soon be contemplating a similar project for the vastly bigger and more prosperous population of Athens barely entered my head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yet, by last month, we were handing out around 2,500 snacks every day in the Greek capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A sandwich or croissant might not sound a lot, but for some people it&#x2019;s vital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Soon our daily handouts may rise to more than 3,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>I am already working to open another two or three centres in Greece to do my bit to help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greece needs our help now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I offer no panaceas &#x2013; indeed, it would be wrong for someone who has spent most of his adult life outside the country to start lecturing Greece and her leaders on the way ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For the moment, however, the food queues remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And those queues don&#x2019;t just contain the unemployed or homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Today it is shop workers, clerks and even professionals who line up &#x2013; all facing the grim prospect of being without work for the foreseeable future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>For them the optimism of 1981 has gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>No one knows when or how it will return.</td></tr>
