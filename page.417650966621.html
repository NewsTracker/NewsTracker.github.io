<h3>Late Colombia goal denies Mexico first World Cup win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Taking a back pass from Tatiana Ariza, Montoya drilled home a shot from just outside the penalty area that rang off the crossbar in the 82nd minute to deny Mexico a first World Cup win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mexico was the better team dominating possession, grabbing the early lead on a brilliant 36th minute strike from midfielder Veronica Perez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>El Tri thought it had pulled out a miracle finish in injury time when striker Charlyn Corral's shot rolled across the goal line only to have it waved off when teammate Stephany Mayor was called for a foul on Colombia's Angela Clavijo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ranked 26th in the world, Mexico will play England in its next game, while number 28 Colombia will face France.</td></tr>
