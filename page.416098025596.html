<h3>Gonzalez homers 3 times to lead Dodgers past Padres 7-4 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's simply about making good contact with the ball for the 32-year-old first baseman, who is dogged in his hitting preparation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's paying off, with three more home runs Wednesday night that made Gonzalez the first player in major league history with five in the season's first three games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He helped the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 7-4 to win their opening series 2-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''Something like that is always cool to be able to accomplish,'' Gonzalez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fittingly, Gonzalez received his Silver Slugger award from last season before the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Then he went out and had a four-hit game to go with consecutive three-hit games on Monday and Tuesday, becoming the first National League player to do so since Orlando Cepeda of San Francisco had three straight three-hit games in 1963.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''He wasn't bad today, huh?'' said Dodgers manager Don Mattingly, a renowned hitter for the Yankees during his playing days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''When you get hot you're just feeling good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gonzalez homered in four consecutive at-bats dating to Tuesday before his RBI single in the sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His five homers in the first three games made major league history, according to information provided to the Dodgers by Elias Sports Bureau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''He's about as locked in as he can be,'' starter Brandon McCarthy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''That's a nightmare for a pitcher to face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He's older and knows exactly his routine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There's so much discipline in his at-bats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Dodgers rallied from a 2-0 deficit in the first to help McCarthy (1-0) earn his first win as one of eight new players on the team this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The right-hander allowed nine hits and four runs, struck out nine and walked one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Joel Peralta pitched the ninth to earn his first NL save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Gonzalez homered in the first and he led off the third with another homer, extending the Dodgers' lead to 5-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He led off the fifth with his third homer - all off Andrew Cashner - and took a curtain call from the dugout steps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''I made three mistakes in the same three spots,'' Cashner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Gonzalez received a standing ovation when he came to the plate in the sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Padres' infield convened on the mound for a conference before Frank Garces gave up an RBI single to Gonzalez, making it 7-4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Gonzalez became the third player in franchise history with homers in his first three games, joining Jimmy Wynn in 1974 and Carl Furillo in 1955.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>McCarthy helped himself, drawing a bases-loaded walk off Cashner (0-1) that forced in Carl Crawford and tied the game 2-all in the second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''It was the loudest I've ever heard it when I've been at bat,'' McCarthy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Dodgers took a 3-2 lead when Jimmy Rollins was safe at first after a successful challenge by the Dodgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Juan Uribe scored from third when first baseman Yonder Alonso bobbled the ball hit to him by Rollins, who was originally called out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Yasiel Puig grounded into an inning-ending fielder's choice double play, allowing Joc Pederson who walked, to score and make it 4-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Cashner gave up eight hits and a career-high-tying six runs - five earned - in five innings, struck out six and walked three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He served up three homers in one game for the first time since May 30, 2013, against Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Justin Upton hit a two-run homer with two outs in the first for the Padres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Will Middlebrooks homered leading off the sixth and Yangervis Solarte added a RBI double.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Padres: OF Melvin Upton will report to the team's spring training home in Peoria, Arizona, to continue treatment for a left foot injury, which sidelined him for much of the spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He's not expected back with the team until next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Upton was acquired last weekend with Craig Kimbrel in a trade with Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Dodgers: LH Clayton Kershaw is scheduled for a root canal Monday, and it's not expected to affect his subsequent start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Gonzalez, who used to star for his hometown team in San Diego, is hurting the Padres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He's hit safely in his last nine games against them and has a .342 career average, including 13 homers and 40 RBI in 50 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''It was a one-man show tonight,'' Padres manager Bud Black said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>''He has power, the ability to hit for average and kick in runs, he used the whole field, and does what the situation calls for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He's a tremendous player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Padres: They host World Series champion San Francisco in their home opener Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>RHP Ian Kennedy (13-13 last season) opposes RHP Tim Hudson (9-13) of the Giants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Dodgers: They're off Thursday to travel to Arizona, where they open a three-game series Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>It'll be a matchup of unrelated Andersons, with lefty Brett starting for the Dodgers against righty Chase for the Diamondbacks.</td></tr>
