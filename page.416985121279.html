<h3>Amid male landscape of 'Mad Max,' Charlize Theron dominates</h3>

<tr><td>5</td><td>| Warner Bros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The inhospitable desert landscape of "Mad Max: Fury Road" isn't so different from today's Hollywood: Low on water and overrun by men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But amid the overflowing testosterone of "Fury Road," George Miller's sequel to his post-apocalyptic franchise, Charlize Theron dramatically stands out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While "Mad Max" may star Tom Hardy as the titular road warrior of "Fury Road," it is effectively Theron's film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She plays Furiosa, a warrior with a shaved head and prosthetic arm, attempting to rescue a harem of wives held captive by a warlord.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"When people first started talking about this film, this loud whisper went around town that George was looking to create a female character that can stand next to Max and carry the journey with him," Theron said in a recent interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"For a female actress, that always sounds intriguing. Look, we hear it all the time and very few filmmakers see that through."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Fury Road," which was to receive a premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday before opening in theaters Friday, is an atypical summer action movie - essentially a two-hour car chase - that's literally and effectively driven by a strong woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lately, a chorus of actresses has spoken out about what they've called inherent sexism in Hollywood and the lack of quality female roles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Meryl Streep, Carey Mulligan, Kristen Stewart and Patricia Arquette have all recently made strong statements about gender inequality in the industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And on Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union asked U.S. state and federal agencies to investigate what it claimed is widespread gender discrimination in Hollywood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's crazy that we live in a world, not just in Hollywood, where women get paid less than men for doing the same job," says Theron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Channeling some rage into Furiosa came naturally: "There were emotional things that I could connect to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Some have even described "Fury Road" as a feminist film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Vagina Monologues" writer Eve Ensler consulted on the movie, working with the actresses playing the enslaved wives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Feminism is such a tricky thing to throw around because I don't think a lot of people know what women mean when they speak in that articulation," says Theron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Really, what it boils down to is just equal rights."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Theron stuck with "Fury Road" through years of delays as shooting shifted from Miller's native Australia to Namibia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It was a lengthy shoot, followed by extensive reshoots the next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Theron acknowledges it was a sometimes trying production, but her commitment to the character is clear enough: Theron shaved off her blonde hair for the role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It wasn't that we were trying to hide her as a female," says Theron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"She had to almost disappear in this environment and everybody had to get to a place where they almost forgot that she was a woman. And I just didn't know how to do that with a ponytail."</td></tr>
