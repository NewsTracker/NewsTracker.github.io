<h3>Egypt fires forensics official over comments on killed woman</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's forensics authority has dismissed its spokesman, a doctor who said last weekend that a female protester killed by police in January died because she did not have enough fat on her body to protect against shotgun pellets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Tuesday statement by authority head Mahmoud Ahmed Ali also said that all doctors and officials at the authority are banned from making comments to the media or providing them with any information about their work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An official in the authority also said that the former spokesman, Hisham Abdel-Hamid, is under investigation by the Justice Ministry for statements made on a program without permission from the agency as required.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He spoke under condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to journalists.</td></tr>
