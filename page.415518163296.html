<h3>Bali nine: executions could be delayed months as judges re-examine Filipina maid's case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The decision is significant for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan because Indonesian authorities have consistently said they intend to execute all 10 drug felons simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Filipina maid Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Supreme Court spokesman Suhadi said a panel of judges would be appointed this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"After that the panel will examine and study her case. It will take months," he said in Kompas newspaper on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Filipina domestic worker Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso was sentenced to death in 2010 for attempting to smuggle 2.6 kilograms of heroin from Malaysia to Yogyakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Veloso maintains she was deceived by an acquaintance and did not know the drugs were in her suitcase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Her lawyer argued she deserved a case review because the translator during her trial was only a student who did not have a license from the Association of Indonesian Translators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Case reviews take up to three months to be determined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On March 12, Attorney-General spokesman Tony Spontana said Indonesian authorities would wait on the result of all legal processes lodged by the felons on death row before proceeding with the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said simultaneous executions were "more efficient and effective".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We don't want one to have to wait for another's execution before his own. That will affect the convicts' psychological state," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nine of the 10 drug felons are now understood to have launched legal proceedings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran will have an appeal against the rejection of their clemency plea heard on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Judicial Commission is also investigating claims the judges who sentenced them to death offered a lighter sentence in exchange for bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Meanwhile, the head of the Central Java Prosecutor's Office, Hartadi, warned Indonesia's sovereignty was at stake if the second batch of executions failed to take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In a speech at a ceremony to induct new officials, Hartadi reportedly said the president said the executions must go ahead despite foreigners manoeuvring to have the executions cancelled or at least delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The Prosecutor's office as part of the law enforcement system must not be daunted by the diplomatic approaches," Mr Hartadi said in Kompas.</td></tr>
