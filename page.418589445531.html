<h3>Google rallies as profit boosted by ad revenue</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Shares of Google rose nearly 12% after the web search leader's profit beat forecasts for the first time in the last six quarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The share price was boosted by strong advertising revenue and comments by its new chief financial officer on disciplined spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google rallied to $673.50 in extended trading after closing at $601.78 on Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That would mark an all-time high for the stock in regular trading if it closes at that level on Friday, adding roughly $40 billion to its market value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google remains the most valuable publicly traded US company after Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google's said last night that its expenses rose 10% to $12.9 billion in the second quarter to the end of June from the year-ago quarter, and remained at 73% of revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But expenses only grew by $91m from the first quarter, and as a percentage of revenue declined by a percentage point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The decline in quarter-over-quarter operating expenses reflects, in part, discipline in expense management and, in part, lower legal expenses than in comparable periods," CFO Ruth Porat told analysts on a conference call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The company said its advertising revenue grew 11% to $16.02 billion from the same time last year, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 18%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Advertisers pay Google only if a user clicks on one of its ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Cost per click," or the average price of online ads, fell 11%, but was more than offset by the increase in ad volumes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Google's ad revenue has been under pressure as consumers access its services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, whose ad rates are typically lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The company said its consolidated revenue rose 11% to $17.73 billion in the quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Net income rose 17% to $3.93 billion from $3.35 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Excluding one-time items, Google earned $6.99 per share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Analysts on average had expected a profit of $6.70 per share, and revenue of $17.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</td></tr>
