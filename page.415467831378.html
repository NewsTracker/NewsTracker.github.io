<h3>A young manager for Clinton juggles data and old baggage</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Carville complained to the host, Andrea Mitchell, that he had "lived through this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Meanwhile, far from the television lights, Robby Mook, the 35-year-old who is likely to manage Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, kept his head down and worked the phones from his standing desk to build a field operation in Iowa, set up technology to collect data to target voters and hire a campaign staff in a handful of key states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mook was 12 and auditioning for school plays in Vermont when Bill Clinton was first elected president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was a popular high school freshman when Kenneth W. Starr investigated Whitewater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The uproar over Hillary Clinton's use of personal email as secretary of state, which shielded her correspondence from public records requests, has presented the first media firestorm in her pursuit of the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But it has also revealed the stark generational divide that confronts her budding 2016 campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Over more than two decades in national politics, the Clintons have amassed an army of well-meaning defenders who will bring to 2016 old battle wounds and axes to grind that date back to the White House and Arkansas - perhaps not the ideal message in a presumptive campaign that seeks to reintroduce the 67-year-old Clinton as a fresh, forward-looking candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It falls largely on Mook, and the band of young operatives he has assembled (called the Mook Mafia), to move the grievance-laden Clinton machine into the modern political age.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The success of Clinton's campaign will rest in part on whether this younger generation of earnest, data- and social-media-savvy operatives can prevail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They are going to be the first ones to hit the beach on D-Day," said Chris Lehane, a Democratic operative and former aide to Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"To get the campaign off the beach while under fire, the front-line troops will need to be in charge and empowered to run a modern-day, forward-looking, smart campaign."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Clintons anointed Mook as much for his ease with data and technology as for his calm temperament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They value his rare ability to charm and include the abundant advice-givers without allowing them to become too intrusive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Still, asserting himself among so many influential veterans will not be easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Even as Mook was starting to build the infrastructure of the campaign, a crowded circle of advisers joined him in deliberating over how Hillary Clinton should respond to the email controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They included John D. Podesta, her presumptive campaign chairman, who has known the Clintons since George McGovern's presidential campaign in 1972; former Clinton administration officials Cheryl D. Mills and James E. Kennedy; Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton; and Mandy Grunwald, who has advised the Clintons since 1992.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ultimately, the strategy they settled on - having Clinton publicly address the controversy Tuesday - harked back to the approach used in 1994, when she held a lengthy news conference to address the Whitewater inquiry and a 1970s commodities trade in Arkansas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Comparisons quickly erupted: "Mrs. Clinton is stuck in the '90s," declared the conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The next day, the operation took its first coordinated step toward wrangling the Clintons' old friends and former aides, like Carville.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Clinton's 31-year-old press secretary, Nick Merrill, hosted a conference call with about 25 far-flung surrogates to make sure they delivered the same message about the emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Part of why Mook landed the job was that in 2013, as the campaign manager for Terry McAuliffe - a close friend to Bill Clinton who is now governor of Virginia - he deftly nurtured the Clintons' vast network of friends with frequent phone calls but did not get distracted by the noise and drama that often attaches itself to the couple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Eighty percent of it is people just want to be heard, and Robby was always available," said Tina Flournoy, chief of staff to Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mook particularly impressed Bill Clinton, who may be the ultimate strategist of his wife's 2016 campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The former president checked in often about specific districts or counties, but Mook did not change course based on his influence, said McAuliffe, who compared him to "a horse in the Kentucky Derby" with blinders on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"President Clinton loved him, and they had a great relationship," McAuliffe said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"But Robby is happiest when he is in his office with his computers and his data."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It helped, of course, that Mook led that campaign to an unlikely victory after McAuliffe's first attempt at the governor's office flamed out in the 2009 Democratic primary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Brennan Bilberry, the McAuliffe campaign's communications director, described Mook's approach as "test everything, question assumptions and let data drive things."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Mook was inducted into the extended Clinton family during the 2008 presidential primary, when he was Hillary Clinton's state campaign director in Indiana, Nevada and Ohio: three states that were rare bright spots in her bruising battle against Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But despite Mook's efforts, the campaign did not keep pace with the Obama team's use of social media, digital targeting and data analytics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"The Clinton field program was not at the same level of sophistication," said Geoff Garin, who succeeded Mark Penn as Hillary Clinton's chief strategist in 2008 and was McAuliffe's pollster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"By the time of the 2013 campaign, Robby was advancing the state of the art rather than trying to catch up with it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That will take some getting used to for the Clintons, who came to power when cellphones seemed state of the art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>In her last campaign, Clinton tapped Patti Solis Doyle, an aide since 1992, as manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Doyle was ousted, and Maggie Williams, another former aide to Clinton, took over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Maintaining your relationships and doing it well takes work, and it's a credit to them," Flournoy said of the Clintons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The unassuming son of a retired physics professor and a hospital administrator, Mook - who did not respond to messages seeking comment for this article - wears a simple uniform of chinos and a polo shirt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He keeps an exhausted campaign staff energized late nights with his goofy sense of humor, including a killer impersonation of Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Mook joined the McAuliffe campaign directly from his job as executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ("without even taking a day off," Garin said).</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He irked some old Clinton operatives by bringing in a mostly new campaign staff to help with McAuliffe's second attempt at the governor's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>And the group surrounding him has its detractors, who say Mook has recreated the cliquish atmosphere that prevented fresh voices from penetrating the Clinton orbit in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In November, ABC News reported on leaked messages from an email list operated by Mook and another young Democratic aide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The sophomoric jokes they contained about Bill Clinton were not particularly damaging but did raise some concerns about their discretion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>But other episodes suggest a maturity to Mook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>In 2008, after the Obama campaign's offices in Indiana were vandalized, he reached out to Mitch Stewart, Obama's state director, to offer him and his staff the use of the Clinton campaign space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The gesture, and others like it, endeared Mook not just to the Clintons but also to Obama aides, many of whom have signed on to senior positions under Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Mook's experience working for the Clintons leaves him well-positioned to bridge the campaign's generational gap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"He's old from the perspective that he worked for the Clintons in 2008 and new enough that he wasn't really part of the inner circle of running the campaign," said Thomas R. Nides, a friend and adviser who worked for Hillary Clinton at the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>No one could have predicted that the first big test of his abilities would come so early, with the email controversy, but people close to Mook say he has blocked out the crisis and is focused on the expected start of the campaign in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"He will be, I think, in a Hillary campaign what he was in the McAuliffe campaign," said Ellen Qualls, a Democratic strategist based in Alexandria, Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"King of avoiding distractions and shiny objects."</td></tr>

<h3>No sight is no problem for young boy who loves music</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>His favorite subject in kindergarten is "recess."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And, in the button-cute little boy's own words: "I'm all about that bass."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>OK, that last one was his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Because Kale is not exactly like other 6-year-olds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He loves to blurt out random non-sequiturs: "I saw an excavator! It's a toy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He wears a retro Ringo-doo, his awesome dark locks falling nearly to his nose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He can rap every lyric of the Beastie Boy's old-school classic "Paul Revere."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He has taught himself to play piano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And, oh yeah, he's never seen his mother, father, sister or anyone else in his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He doesn't know light from dark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The visual world is not his world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But that's OK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kale was born with a rare condition, Isolated Bilateral cryptophthalmos, which is a congenital eyelid malformation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His eyes are not visible, but are instead covered by tissue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There have only been a few dozen cases reported worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When he was an infant, doctors were able to open his eyes for a short time, but the skin fused back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It's just the way he is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And Kale and his family are fine with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In fact, they're better than fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They're awesome - a close, loose family - heavy on laughing, loudness and music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"It doesn't bother him," said his mother, Kim Apongan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"He doesn't know any different. He doesn't understand the concept that there is such a thing as sight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Kim, a part-time cosmetologist, and her husband Mike Apongan, a U.S. postal worker, had no idea of their son's condition until he was born.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"But we got over that," Kim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"He doesn't need to see me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Kale snuggled up against his mother as she talked, often breaking in with more random "Kaleisms": "I heard the Ketchup commercial and I woke up laughing!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Kale laughs a lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Life is good for the Blue Angel Elementary School kindergarten student.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Life's not quiet, but it is good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Without sight, Kale relies on his other senses heavily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Especially hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"He loves sounds," said his protective 10-year-old big sister, Maile - pronounced Miley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"It can get crazy loud," Kim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>See, Kale loves music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Be it the Beastie Boys or Beethoven or even Julie Andrews, who he listened to recently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"He loves movies where there's a lot of singing," Maile said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"I know it's horrible, but he loves the Beastie Boys."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>And don't forget about Run-DMC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Kale hasn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Moments later, Kale walked to his own bedroom where a small television was blaring "Aliens Versus Monsters."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Keyboards and guitars and even a small drum set scattered across the room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Kale sat down at his keyboard and began to fiddle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Soon, he was making a "doorbell" sound with the keyboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Over and over and over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"He loves the sound doorbells make," Kim whispered while Kale kept at it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>His mother turned down the movie to let Kale play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>He nodded "yes" and Mom complied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Soon, the movie and Kale's piano were at near equal volumes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>He loves the sensory stimulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Which is why one of his favorite places is Blues Angel Music, where Kale recently went to town on a set of congo drums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"He comes in and hangs out," said Stephen Olsen of Blues Angel Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"He can feel the instruments and play and hear the sounds. We're happy to have him here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Most people are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Yes, he looks just a tad different from most boys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>His dark bangs hang down over where his eyes would be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>The family has had to endure other children teasing, but that's not much of a problem anymore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Especially since big sister Maile - she'll be 11 on March 16 - has his back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>She walks him to class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>"Some kids are not very nice," Kim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>"But we dealt with that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Maile made sure of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>"I just said 'I got it, don't worry,' " Maile said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>"No one is going to mess with him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Yes, Maile is a super big sister and a star student.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>On Thursday, she was named Blue Angels Elementary School's "Shining Star," earning her a new bicycle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Now, curious students are more likely to approach Maile with questions about her brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>"They just want to understand, because they're confused," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>"They're not being mean. They just want to know."</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>And that's the best approach to take with Kale, Mom said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>"He loves to meet people," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>"Just talk to him. He loves to talk."</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Everyone laughed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>It's an understatement that Kale loves to talk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>"He just cracks me up," his dad said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>"What's funny is that at 2 or 3 in the morning he will just wake up and ask me questions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Just then, Kale piped in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Dad laughed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Mom laughed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Maile laughed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>"I think he could be a comedian," Mike said when asked about his son's future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>"And music will always be a big part of his life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>But who knows what else he will tackle?</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>After all, he's 6 and taught himself to play piano just by listening to music and sounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>"He's fearless," Mom said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>"Sometimes it's scary he's so fearless."</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>He would love to ride bikes with his sister and family, but can't really leave the driveway on his little bike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>The family recently entered a contest to win a $1,500 Buddy Bike - a tandem-style bike for children with special needs that allows the child to pedal while the parent steers - but they didn't win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>"He just wants to try everything," mom said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>"He's an amazing kid. We have two awesome kids."</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Kim recalled the day that Kale came home from the hospital after his birth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>Maile looked at her little brother for the first time and began singing "Brahams' Lullaby" to Kale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>"It was so beautiful and incredible," Kim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>"I just cried. It was the sweetest thing."</td></tr>
