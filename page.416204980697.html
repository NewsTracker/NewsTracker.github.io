<h3>Punishment for Kenyan gang rapists lifted from cutting grass to 15 years' jail</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nairobi: A Kenyan court has convicted three men for the brutal gang rape of a schoolgirl, boosting their original punishment of being made to cut grass to 15 years in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Today's sentencing is sure to have a ripple effect across the nation, and hopefully the region at large," said lawyer Kimberly Brown, from the campaign group Equality Now, which supported the schoolgirl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Worldwide outrage over the punishment prompted more than 1.8 million people to sign an online petition demanding justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The then 16-year-old victim, known by the pseudonym Liz, was reportedly attacked, beaten and then raped by six men as she returned from her grandfather's funeral in western Kenya in June, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The gang dumped her, bleeding and unconscious, in a deep sewage ditch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She suffered a broken back, caused either by the beating or by being hurled down into the pit, as well as serious internal injuries from the rape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The case made global headlines after it emerged that three of the alleged rapists whom Liz identified were ordered by police to cut grass around the police station as punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other suspects are on the run, with the public prosecutor ordering they be "apprehended and brought to justice without further delay".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sentencing had been set for last Friday but was delayed after one of the men skipped bail and failed to turn up, but police arrested him over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rape is a serious problem in Kenya but is seldom taken seriously by the police, rights groups say.</td></tr>
