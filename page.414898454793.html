<h3>Zimbabwe censors '50 Shades of Grey' scenes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The censors demanded that erotic scenes from the R-rated drama be deleted before it is shown in the southern African country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"There are scenes in the film that are just too indecent to be shown to the public," said Isaac Chiranganyika, the Board of Censors secretary, said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The film based on EL James' book of the same name, explores themes of bondage and domination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Movie theatres in Zimbabwe will only be allowed to show a censored version of the film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While most theatres have agreed to run the chopped-up version, one theater in the capital Harare said it won't screen "Fifty Shades of Grey" at all, because heavy censorship would remove too much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was felt that heavy censorship would compromise the integrity of the film," the Sam Levy Village shopping center, site of the movie theater, said on its Facebook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Zimbabwean artists and filmmakers have regularly criticized the board's decisions to censor works that were seen as too erotic, violent or political.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The board's chairman, Heya Malaba, 95, has been uncompromising about erotic movie scenes in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For those who want to watch the whole film, pirated copies should soon be available on city street corners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I just have to wait a week or so and I will be buying 'Fifty Shades of Grey' for $1 from the vendors," said Harare resident Stam Zengeni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"So no problem."</td></tr>

<h3>Parliament: UK, EU 'sleepwalked' into Ukraine crisis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The House of Lords' EU Committee said foreign ministries in Britain and other European countries have been poorly equipped to draw up an "authoritative response" to the crisis partly because they lack expertise on Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The (British) government has not been as active or as visible on this issue as it could have been," the committee said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It also said that for too long the EU had been optimistic about Russia's democratic development, and as a result Europe failed to realize the depth of Russian hostility when the EU opened talks on Ukraine in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier this month, Britain's former senior NATO commander General Richard Shirreff said British Prime Minister David Cameron's failure to act over Ukraine had turned him into a "foreign policy irrelevance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>France and Germany have led the diplomatic process to hammer out a cease-fire deal with their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Britain's Foreign Office said no one could have predicted the scale of the "unjustifiable and illegal" Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine, and that it is for the Ukrainian people to decide whether they want a closer relationship with the EU.</td></tr>
