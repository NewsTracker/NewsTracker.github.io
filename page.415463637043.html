<h3>Egypt sacks 41 judges for 'supporting' Brotherhood</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Disciplinary Council headed by Nabil Zaki, a judge, did not immediately release the reason for its decision on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The government has implemented a harsh crackdown on Islamists and secular political opponents since July 2013, when then-army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi following mass protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Reuters news agency reported that 31 of the judges were sent into compulsory retirement for signing a statement condemning Morsi's removal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Another 10 were removed from their posts for joining the "Judges for Egypt" group, which supported the Brotherhood even before Morsi's removal, Reuters reported, citing judicial sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egyptian law prohibits judges from engaging in politics, but critics and human rights groups say the judicial disciplinary court has turned a blind eye to judges who openly support the government of Sisi, who was elected president last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The government says the judiciary is independent and it never intervenes in its work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The decision is shocking and it is a massacre of the judges," Ahmed El-Khatib, one of the punished judges, told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He made no comment about whether he supported the Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The judges have the right to appeal the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Separately, security forces arrested 63 middle-level Brotherhood leaders who face charges of attacking police headquarters and inciting violence, Egypt's interior ministry said in a statement on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Another 13 Brotherhood supporters were arrested on suspicion of possessing arms and ammunition, it added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The government blacklisted the Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation in December 2013, and Sisi says it is a threat to national security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The group says it is committed to peaceful activism.</td></tr>
