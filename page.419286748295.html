<h3>Subterranean river discovered beneath Mexico's Chichen Itza ruins</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Experts have discovered that the main pyramid at Mexico's Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza was at least partially built atop a subterranean river.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mexico's National Autonomous University scientists say they found a subterranean cavity about 20 metres deep below the pyramid of Kukulkan, also known as El Castillo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Geophysics expert Rene Chavez said on Thursday that the underground river chamber is naturally covered by rock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Such underground rivers often connect the open cenotes, or sinkhole lakes, that dot Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The discovery was made using a kind electrical resistance survey, not by excavating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chavez said one corner of the pyramid rested on the underground chamber, so it was in danger of collapsing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Archaeologist Guillermo de Anda said the discovery was important.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>De Anda, who did not participate in the study, said it may confirm that the Mayas included symbolic maps of their cosmology in their temples and sacred sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The cenotes that surround the pyramid could represent the four points of the compass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The river at the center might represent the center of the Maya's universe, which they thought of as a tree with roots reaching below ground.</td></tr>
