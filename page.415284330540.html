<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"We announce our allegiance to the Caliph ... and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity, in hardship and ease," according to a translation of a message purporting to be by Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>"This is a group that has shown its ability to evolve at an almost dizzying pace ... and its leadership has shown a great flexibility in ideology and methods, depending on who they choose to align with."</td></tr>
