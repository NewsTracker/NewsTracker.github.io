<h3>Colorado theater shooter James Holmes guilty of murder</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>James Holmes, the Colorado madman who opened fire inside of a packed movie theater in 2012, has been found guilty on all charges including first-degree murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 27-year-old had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the massacre which killed 12 people and wounded 70 others during a midnight showing three years ago next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A jury deliberated for about a day and half on the charges before reaching their verdict which triggered no apparent reaction from the killer who stood beside his attorney with his hands in his pockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He now faces either life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The state's last execution was in 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was the first since capital punishment was reinstated in 1975.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jurors were asked to return Wednesday to begin the sentencing phase of the trial, two days after the third anniversary of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Holmes' charges included 24 counts of first-degree murder and 140 counts of attempted murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The counts were doubled for his victims because each included an additional count of committing the acts with "an attitude of universal malice manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life generally."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was also found guilty of an explosives and weapons charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Holmes' defense had argued that he suffered schizophrenia and was not in control of himself when he dyed his hair red like the Joker, put on a gas mask and stormed the Aurora theater on July 20, 2012, with an assault rifle, shotgun and pistol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His victims were watching a showing of the Batman movie "The Dark Night Rises" when the Hollywood violence was replaced with real carnage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Holmes, who had been working toward his Ph.D. in neuroscience, was arrested in the parking lot as survivors were still fleeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He admitted to having booby trapped his apartment in hopes it would explode and divert first responders away from his killing spree, investigators testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>During the three-month trial, the prosecution called more than 200 witnesses over two months, more than 70 of them survivors, including some who were missing limbs and using wheelchairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They recalled the panic to escape the black-clad gunman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The victims included two active-duty servicemen, a single mom, a man celebrating his 27th birthday and an aspiring broadcaster who had survived a mall shooting in Toronto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Several died shielding friends or loved ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The youngest to die was a six-year-old girl whose mother also suffered a miscarriage and was paralyzed in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Another woman who was nine months pregnant at the time described her agonizing decision to leave her wounded husband behind in the theater to save their baby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She later gave birth in the same hospital where he was in a coma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He can no longer walk and has trouble talking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That Holmes was the lone gunman was never in doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>His attorneys argued he suffers from schizophrenia and was in the grip of a psychotic breakdown so severe that he was unable to tell right from wrong - Colorado's standard for insanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They said he was delusional even as he secretively acquired the three murder weapons while concealing his plans from friends and two worried psychiatrists in the months before the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Defense lawyers tried to present him as a once-promising student so crippled by mental illness that he couldn't reveal his struggles to anyone who might have helped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They called two psychiatrists, including a nationally known schizophrenia expert, who concluded Holmes was psychotic and legally insane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>One nurse, who oversaw the killer while he was being held inside the Arapahoe County Jail, testified that she saw him smear feces on himself, lick walls and eat paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Outside of these bizarre moments, however, she said that he usually behaved normally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That included him showering, exercising, reading and watching television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Two state-appointed doctors also found him sane, testifying for prosecutors that no matter what Holmes' mental state was that night, he knew what he was doing was wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>If he had been found not guilty by reason of insanity he would have been committed indefinitely to a state mental hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Jurors watched nearly 22 hours of videotaped interviews showing Holmes talking in a flat, mechanical tone about his desire to kill strangers to increase his self-worth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Using short, reluctant answers, he said he felt nothing as he fired, blasting techno music through his earphones to drown out his victims' screams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Prosecutors showed jurors Holmes' spiral notebook, where he scribbled a self-diagnosis of his "broken mind" and described his "obsession to kill" since childhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The pages alternate between incoherent ramblings and elaborate plans for the killings, including lists of weapons to buy and diagrams showing which auditoriums in the theater complex would allow for the most casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Jurors saw an investigator's video of the shooting's aftermath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It showed bodies wedged between rows of seats and sprawled across aisles amid spent ammunition, spilled popcorn and blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>During the sentencing phase, Holmes' attorneys will present so-called mitigating factors that they hope will save his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Those will probably include more evidence of mental illness and a sympathetic portrayal of his childhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Prosecutors will present so-called aggravating factors in support of the death penalty, including the large number of victims.</td></tr>
