<h3>Gov. Walker says he expects to meet with Netanyahu in Israel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) " Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a likely Republican presidential candidate, said he "absolutely" expects to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his first visit to Israel next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As he prepared to depart for a western European trade mission, Walker told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday that the Netanyahu meeting in mid-May is not yet confirmed, but that it's his "hope and expectation" it will happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A spokeswoman for Walker's political group, Our American Revival, did not immediately confirm Friday whether the meeting has been set up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Walker met with British Prime Minister David Cameron during a trade mission to London in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Walker departs Friday for visits to Germany, France and Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Walker originally planned for his Israel trip to be a taxpayer-funded trade mission, but he determined that was impossible because the "overwhelming majority" of those who wanted to meet with him in Israel had a political interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His political arm is footing the bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Walker said his goal is to meet with Netanyahu and other members of the Israeli government to get an understanding of the issues facing the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Walker has recently hired foreign policy experts to help bolster his credentials, and the Israel visit will be his third trip overseas in four months as he prepares for a likely White House bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Among likely candidates for the Republican nomination in 2016, Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush are so far receiving the most attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to announce her candidacy on Sunday, is considered the leading contender for the Democratic nomination.</td></tr>
