<tr><td>31</td><td>"Someone outside screaming? The high-pitched string band notes we had heard earlier on the radio?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"No, the radio was off and people had taken shelter. It was Pam in her many voices. She spoke a language of essential fear at its most primitive and we understood it instantly."</td></tr>
