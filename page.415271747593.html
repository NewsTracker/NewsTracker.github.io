<h3>Russia: 2 suspects detained in killing of Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The head of Russia's federal security service said Saturday that two suspects have been detained in the killing a week ago of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Alexander Bortnikov made the statement on state television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said the two suspects were from Russia's North Caucasus region, but no other details were given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was not clear if either of the suspects was believed to have fired the shots that killed Nemtsov as he walked over a bridge with a companion near the Kremlin on Feb. 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Thousands of people clutching flowers and candles lined up Tuesday on a typically bleak, gray afternoon to pay their last respects to Boris Nemtsov, the charismatic politician and opposition leader who was gunned down last week in the shadow of the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nemtsov's killing shocked Russia's already beleaguered and marginalized opposition supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Suspicion in the opposition is high that the killing was ordered by the Kremlin in retaliation for Nemtsov's adamant criticism of President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 55-year-old was reportedly working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Russia's top investigative body said it was investigating several possible motives, including that he was killed in an attempt to smear Putin's image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It also said it was looking into possible connections to Islamic extremism and Nemtsov's personal life.</td></tr>
