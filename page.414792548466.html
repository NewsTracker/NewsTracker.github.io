<h3>Channel24.co.za | We got up close and personal with Mike Rosenberg from Passenger</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>I asked him some quick questions and then sat on the grass a few metres away from him while he performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was as singularly wonderful as it sounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Channel 24: Welcome to Cape Town Mike, you're completing your South African tour with this show, tell us what some of your favourite moments have been so far?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>M.R: It's hard to put my finger on one moment but Johannesburg was wonderful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And so was Durban, you know to come out here and have this amount of support is so unexpected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Heart on Fire didn't do as well as the last record in most territories, but South Africa is one of the places it did really well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I think, and I don't know if it's because of Searching for Sugar Man, but South Africans seem to not have to go with what's popular but what they like and that's refreshing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Channel 24: That's so great to hear and what about the local food, have you tried any local dishes that you enjoy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>M.R: We have had a lot of good food, I don't know if it's been very indigenous but it's all been lovely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Actually we tried this one that was likes condensed milk but not?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Channel 24: Milk Tart?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Channel 24: And we saw recently that you went on safari, what animals did you see?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>M.R: Well, we didn't see any of the big cats, so that was disappointing, but we did see giraffes and Rhinos and Kudus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's all so amazing, we don't have that in England, it's all like Badgers (laughs) so that was incredible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Channel 24: Seeing as though this is the last show, would you like to say anything to the fans that have come to see you in South Africa?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Channel 24: One last thing, a little something for our bearded editor, do you have any beard growing tips?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>M.R: Just let it grow, never cut it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Because you'll trim on the one side and then you'll want to cut it on the other side and it's like a box of frogs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Just let it grow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Channel 24: Your beard is magnificent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>M.R: Only from far away, if you get closer you'll see it's a mess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Channel 24: (I) don't believe you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>M.R: *Chuckle* Trust me you don't want to get closer.</td></tr>
