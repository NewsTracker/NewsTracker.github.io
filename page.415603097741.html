<h3>Linda Goldston, former Mercury News reporter, pets columnist, dies at 67</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>She was 67.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The author of a popular pets column that attracted armies of enthusiastic readers, Goldston, a Tennessee native, worked at the San Jose newspaper for 38 years before retiring to Paso Robles in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She was long known for her determined and energetic pursuit of stories, whether she was probing for answers from an accused killer or inspiring readers to generously open their hearts to help the unfortunate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Linda Goldston was as good a reporter as I've ever known," said former Mercury News reporter and author Mike Weiss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"She was thorough and skeptical without being cynical, dogged without being pushy -- and brave."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Weiss noted Goldston's well-known brusque manner, but said it "protected a kind heart animated by the deep desire to see justice done and wrongdoing punished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While Goldston penned many memorable pieces, her February 1999 series, "Zoo Animals To Go," was probably one of two that was most dear to her heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The four-part saga, detailed how "every year, animals once admired at dozens of the country's major zoos are sold or given away to dealers, contributing to a multi-billion-dollar-a-year exotic species marketplace," wrote Goldston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For the newspaper's Sunday West Magazine, Goldston and Weiss looked into the murky world of missing and murdered children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She was undaunted even by one of the creepiest characters she encountered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He was a very strange and potentially a very dangerous man who liked to visit the graves of murdered girls well past midnight," said Weiss of the suspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Linda was persuaded he was the murderer, yet to encourage him to open up to her, she accompanied him to a graveyard in the dead of night."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Linda Joy Goldston, born Feb. 12, 1948, never lost her gentle twang sculpted from growing up in Harriman, a tiny "temperance town" founded in 1889 in Tennessee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She attended the University of Tennessee for two years, but transferred to the famed School of Journalism at the University of Missouri, where she earned a degree in photojournalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After working for a year as a photographer and staff writer at Today's News in Harriman, Goldston arrived at the Mercury News in June of 1974 as a temporary summer hire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The paper didn't let her go -- for nearly four decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Linda was a reporter's reporter," said Bert Robinson, Managing Editor/Content for the Bay Area News Group and a longtime colleague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"She had a fascination with unseemly characters, a deep affection for the downtrodden, and the skill to get both groups to tell their stories to her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She was an avid smoker known to take outdoor cigarette breaks with mathematical precision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She loved her bevy of cats -- Bouncer, Maggie, Sara, Angelina, Jack and Jake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And she was a rabid fan of the Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team and Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In her 60s, Goldston happily landed a ticket to see Lady Gaga in a Bay Area concert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Goldston also loved to devour detective novels, especially paperbacks featuring the dark and difficult NYPD Sgt. Kathleen Mallory, created by her favorite author, Carol O'Connell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Meanwhile, in the newsroom, the diminutive, bespectacled Goldston was a dependable deadline writer with a disarming smile, blunt talk, a sweet tooth and the junk-food eating habits of a teenager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I always remember her walking through the newsroom with a Diet Coke and a laugh, wanting to talk with everyone about what they were working on," said Karen Casto, an assistant business editor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Linda took so much joy from her work. She thought it was a privilege and she treasured that every day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>About six years ago, Goldston started battling a rash of serious respiratory problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In November 2012, she quietly retired, eschewing the customary newsroom going-away hoopla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Soon she moved to the Paso Robles home of her long time companion, Teresa Allen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Linda was doing well until about a month ago," said Allen, who teaches journalism at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"She indulged her passions by reading a book a day, working on her memoir and reading the 20 magazines she subscribed to -- from The Nation to People."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But due to a grave lung infection, Goldston entered hospice about three weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Before that, she was driving her car and, of course, smoking," said Allen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"She was a quiet curmudgeon but she so loved the Mercury and being a reporter, I think she would have wanted to die in the newsroom."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Goldston is survived by Allen and by two sisters -- Betty and Jane -- who still live in Harriman.</td></tr>

<h3>Spike in Ebola in Guinea could reflect access to hidden patients</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The number of suspected cases in the West African country has more than doubled from last month, according to the health ministry, prompting fears the epidemic could mushroom as it did in Liberia and Sierra Leone in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, Jean-Marie Dangou, the WHO's Guinea country representative, said the uptick in cases was explained by previously hostile communities opening up to Ebola teams, mainly lead by the Red Cross.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Unfortunately this has led to the discovery, not unexpected, of a large number of hidden cases and community deaths," Dangou told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The worst Ebola outbreak in history, which has killed more than 10,000 people in West Africa, appears to be on the wane, especially in Liberia where there are no current cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But there is still resistance to the anti-Ebola effort in Guinea, which is struggling to control the outbreak and has overtaken Sierra Leone as the main hub for transmission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Red Cross intensified its campaign to win over suspicious locals in Guinea last month after the Thomson Reuters Foundation reported their Ebola teams were coming under increasingly violent attacks on a regular basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hostility toward Ebola aid workers has declined from 30 known areas of resistance in January to a handful of areas in the capital Conakry and the surrounding districts in March, according to incident mapping by the health ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, some health workers involved in the Ebola response pin the rise in cases to a lack of resources and poor training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Earlier this year, labs in Guinea botched more than 20 Ebola blood tests which led to the release of at least four positive patients, two of whom later died, health officials told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Stemming the spread of the virus in and around the crowded city of Conakry presents the biggest challenge, especially in the districts of Coyah and Forecariah that are the source of most chains of transmission, said Dangou.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>David Heymann, of Public Health England, who dealt with the Ebola outbreak in what was then Zaire in 1976 as well as subsequent epidemics in Africa, said the proven way to stop Ebola transmission is through isolation and knowledge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It doesn't surprise me that in Liberia where there has been a much more intense Ebola information campaign, quarantine and a military intervention that the disease has been brought under control faster than in Guinea," Heymann said by phone from London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In an election year, Guinea President Alpha Conde has pledged to reach zero Ebola cases by mid-April, but has so far avoided quarantine measures or the foreign-backed military interventions used in Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
