<h3>UBS chairman says Greek default increasingly seen by IMF as controllable</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Axel Weber, Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS, speaks at The New Growth Context event in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos January 21, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS's (UBSG.VX) chairman said a default by Greece is seen by the International Monetary Fund as "systemically controllable" and he believed it would have a negligible impact on the Swiss bank itself, according to a newspaper interview published on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Athens is lurching closer to bankruptcy, with its next big test on May 12, when it is due to pay 750 million euros to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Euro zone finance ministers told Greece on Friday that its leftist government would get no more aid until it agreed a complete economic reform plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In an interview with Neue Zuercher Zeitung, the chairman of Zurich-based UBS, Axel Weber, addressed the alternative if euro zone and Greek officials fail to reach an agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I've just come from a meeting of the International Monetary Fund. There, the consensus is increasingly that a Greek default would be systemically controllable," Weber said in the interview, without elaborating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Weber is the former head of Germany's central bank, during which time he also served as the German governor of the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He has been chairman of UBS since 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Weber said the Swiss bank had reduced its exposure to Greek debt long ago, and that thus a default would have negligible consequences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The impact of a potential Greek default is the biggest risk to the euro zone's economic recovery after a long crisis from which the 19-nation currency area is finally emerging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Unlike at the height of the crisis in 2011-12, economists believe the euro zone is far better placed to withstand any Greek default because the currency bloc has its own bailout fund, support from the European Central Bank and a banking union that can protect banks from crisis fallout.</td></tr>
