<h3>St. Louis county officials announce arrest in shooting of police officers in Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jeffrey Williams was arrested Saturday night and is charged with two counts of assault in the first degree, three counts of armed criminal action and firing a weapon from a vehicle, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said during the afternoon press conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>McCulloch said Williams was "out there earlier that evening as part of the demonstration" and told police that he fired shots at someone he had a dispute with, and hit the officers, who he alleges were not his intended target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're not sure we completely buy that part of it," McCulloch said, adding that there might have been other people in a vehicle Williams is accused of firing from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But several activists who've been involved in the protests since the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer told The Associated Press they were not familiar with Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters - who also hadn't heard of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is a fear tactic," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, "I don't know him. I've never seen him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>McCulloch said Williams' story of a dispute with another person -- including that he did not target the police -- is still part of the investigation, which is ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>McCulloch said the .40-caliber handgun that matches the shell casings recovered at the scene of the officers' shootings was found in Williams' residence, which police searched after obtaining a warrant based on information received from the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Williams, who is being held on $300,000 cash bond, had a warrant out on him because he is on probation for receiving stolen property and has failed to appear to his parole officer for the past seven months, McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Williams is scheduled to appear in county court in Clayton Monday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he didn't know whether Williams had an attorney or when he'd appear in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A message left at the St. Louis County Justice Center was not immediately returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tips from the public were key in leading police to Williams, and McCulloch urged anyone with information to contact local law enforcement with further information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The officers -- a 41-year-old St. Louis County officer and a 32-year-old officer from Webster Groves -- were shot Thursday as protests were winding down following the resignation of Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jackson was the sixth city official to leave office following a Justice Department review of the city's law enforcement practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Both wounded officers were released from the hospital Thursday, and St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar -- who called the attack an ambush -- said they could have been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The St. Louis County officer was shot in the right shoulder, with the bullet exiting through his back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The officer from Webster Groves was shot in the right cheek, just below the eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The bullet became lodged behind his ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The shots were believed to come from a handgun across the street from the police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The gunman may have fired from up to 120 yards away, a distance longer than a football field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But with a line of roughly 20 officers standing in front of the building, the shooter did not have to be particularly accurate to hit two of them, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Belmar said Friday detectives were working around the clock to crack that case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The department's top priority, he said, was to continue "a tempo of service and protection and relationships" that ensure Ferguson does not "have a regression from all that we've done since last fall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The gunfire drew instant, broad condemnation from activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Dozens of protesters gathered again Thursday night in Ferguson, expressing sympathy for the wounded officers and praying for peace during a candlelight vigil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We cannot afford these kinds of incidents happening. That gets us absolutely nowhere," said St. Louis activist John Gaskin III.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He called the gunfire "disgraceful and cowardly" and said people "need to be working for reforms and justice, not revenge."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Robinson said the wounding of the officers "definitely set us back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But he believes protesters can regain what they lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Even last night as we protested, police were very gracious to us," he said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"That shows a lot of trust to us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Gaskin said protesters should take stock in the Ferguson house cleaning they helped achieve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement Sunday that the arrest "sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated" and praised "significant cooperation between federal authorities and the St. Louis County Police Department."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>President Obama condemned the shooting of the officers, saying that though the city's law enforcement practices were "oppressive and objectionable," there was "no excuse" for violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Obama made the remarks during a taped appearance on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Brown's family issued a statement Thursday condemning the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement," the statement read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"It cannot and will not be tolerated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and the City Council issued a joint statement saying they support "peaceful protesting" but "will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying actions."</td></tr>

<h3>Greek Jews Remember Transport to Nazi Death Camps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>About 2,000 people joined together at Thessaloniki's Freedom Square for the 72nd anniversary of the roundup and deportation of the Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Some held banners that said: "Racism Kills, Let's Learn from History," and "Never Again."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The crowd then marched to the northern city's old railway station, where the first of 19 trains departed for the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp complex on March 15, 1943.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A locomotive believed to have been used to transport Jews, and four carriages that normally would carry cattle and in which people spent nine days locked up on their way to the extermination camps, were at the station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The crowd laid flowers on the wagons and the tracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was a horrible, mournful, rainy day. Even the skies were weeping," recalled Heinz Cunho, 87, one of fewer than 100 surviving Greek Jews who made it back from the camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Normally, the carriages held 50 people. There were 80 of us to a wagon, and they had us locked up throughout the nine-day trip."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece's government has decided to include among its demands for German World War II reparations a sum, today equivalent to 50 million euros ($53 million), paid as a ransom to Nazi occupiers in 1942 to free about 10,000 Jewish men used as slave laborers in Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They were freed, but still sent subsequently to death camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Jews, mostly Sephardic refugees from Spain and its Inquisition, formed the majority of Thessaloniki's inhabitants from the 16th to early 20th centuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Their numbers dwindled in the early 20th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Of the 46,091 Thessaloniki Jews sent to the camps, 1,950 survived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Others avoided the camps by either joining the partisan resistance or escaping to Turkey by boat, with the help of residents, and making it to the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Today, the Jewish community in the city of nearly 800,000 numbers fewer than 2,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We are marching upon the footsteps that Greek Jews marched back then. We must remain united and opposed to Nazism, racism and anti-Semitism," said David Saltiel, head of Thessaloniki's Jewish community.</td></tr>
