<h3>A documentary prompts a murder charge: The saga of millionaire Robert Durst continues</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW ORLEANS - Robert Durst couldn't explain away similarities between his handwriting and a letter he said "only the killer could have written" that alerted police to his friend's shooting 15 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Confronted with new evidence by the makers of a documentary about his links to three killings, the troubled millionaire blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom, still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There it is. You're caught!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Durst whispered before the sound of running water is heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That moment didn't just make for a captivating finale to a six-part documentary on the eccentric life of an heir to a New York real estate fortune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It also may have given police and prosecutors more evidence in the long-cold case of a mobster's daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Susan Berman was felled by a bullet to the back of her head as investigators prepared to find out what she knew about the disappearance of Durst's wife in 1982.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Los Angeles prosecutors filed a first-degree murder charge Monday that alleges Durst lay in wait with a gun and killed a witness - special circumstances that could carry a death sentence if prosecutors decide later to pursue it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Durst, 71, who was arrested at a New Orleans hotel on the eve of Sunday's final episode, agreed Monday to face trial for the murder of Berman, who had vouched for him in public after his wife vanished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Attorney Dick DeGuerin said outside court that Durst didn't kill Berman, and is "ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The makers of "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" said Durst rejected his lawyer's advice to stay quiet before granting two lengthy interviews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They also said he knew he was being recorded throughout, and that they shared any evidence they gathered with authorities long before broadcasting the film on HBO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Legal experts said the bathroom tape could become key evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him, they can use against him," said Andrea Roth, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Even if it's sketchy, and only in context appears to make him look guilty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Kerry Lawrence, a defense attorney in Westchester County, New York, said Durst's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments, perhaps dismissing them as a joke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self-reflection, and he I assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded, and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative," Lawrence said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I don't think it's quite the smoking gun."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The bathroom recording was not part of the evidence presented to prosecutors before charges were filed because detectives were still trying to determine if the recording was tampered with in any way, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly because the investigation was ongoing and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the handwriting analysis was the key new evidence in the long investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The documentary showed filmmaker Andrew Jarecki confronting Durst with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted Beverly Hills police to look for a "cadaver" at Berman's address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Durst offered that whoever sent it was "taking a big risk. You're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written."</td></tr>

<h3>Raissman: Kentucky's Calipari downplays Tournament top seed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"You know, I got in the house late," Calipari said matter-of-factly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"So I had the guys kind of tell me what was going on. And I looked up...."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Either Calipari knew last summer his team would arrive at this destination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Or we were getting a look at the less obsessed, Cool Hand John.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Maybe even a guy looking for a new image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The timing is good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The man is already a god.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In basketball terms, of course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Many moons ago TV networks, who spend hours, days, months and billions covering college basketball, began deifying top coaches, making them the game's celebrities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>College players come and go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Legendary coaches stay put.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The networks know the big names will be around to promote and sell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>RELATED: KENTUCKY IS EASY PICK - WHAT ABOUT THE REST?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>So on CBS Sunday night, Greg Gumbel told us it was "Mike Krzyzewski's 20th straight" tourney appearance and "Roy Williams' 21st consecutive" trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The schools (Duke, North Carolina/Kansas) did not receive top billing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>For coaches, that's now reserved for Calipari.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He is better than the rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He's got it all going.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>His team is on top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Better still, Calipari is a polarizing bundle of controversy - as much scoundrel as coach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He's got a checkered past in terms of NCAA allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He leads with his mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The free world is not universally digging his act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>His sincerity is often doubted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Calipari is a cat you either are hopelessly devoted to or despise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He's absolutely made for TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Those who make TV know it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This is why he is being forced fed to the unwashed masses and will continue being jammed down our throats throughout the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>We are already sick of Calipari.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>This from someone who actually likes him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The tipping point came on ESPN's "Outside The Lines."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The presentation was thoughtful enough, a one-on-one with Calipari followed by a panel discussion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>There were no grand revelations, nor did we expect any.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>It appeared the session was, even coincidentally, an attempt at an image makeover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Specific reasons "why" Calipari is perceived in a certain manner (that he is what people don't like about college basketball), were offered and explored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>There were also attempts to show another side of that troubling image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Like when Michael Sokolove, who co-authored a book with Calipari, explained how the coach, who he described as someone "who wants to work on himself" goes to church everyday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Calipari goes to mass, Sokolove said, not only for the spiritual side but also: "To remind himself what's important to him. What are the pillars that he stands for. One of them is to do good in the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The words painted a portrait of a man who is not as obsessed, driven, and willing to put recruiting and winning ahead of everything else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Yahoo! Sports columnist Dan Wetzel suggested a more "mellow" Calipari is evolving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>This might be tough to swallow for those who remember Calipari saying: "If you come after one of my players, I come after you twice as hard. If you kill one of mine, I burn your village."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>That side was on display hours later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The visual was an animated, eye bugging, Calipari working the sideline as Kentucky was pounding Arkansas in the SEC Tournament final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The audio provided by ESPN's Dick Vitale, was heavy into preaching, and sounding like tears could flow at any moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"He (Calipari) coaches every possession. His heart and soul is in it," Vitale, pumping up the passion, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"Then it becomes contagious for people on the floor."</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Calipari's heart was not beating nearly as hard during a measured postgame interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>He would be back on TV - AGAIN - later downplaying the accomplishment verbally and symbolically, while showing his defensive side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>On ESPN, Rece Davis asked Calipari why Kentucky didn't cut the nets down after winning the SEC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"Can I tell you honestly?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Calipari asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"No, I prefer you lie to me," Davis answered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Calipari said his team simply forgot and walked off the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>The coach claimed he was concerned about explaining it to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"You know because it's me there's some meaning to it (not cutting down the nets) and some plan," Calipari said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"There wasn't."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>So, those who saw symbolism in the net thing, like there's only one set of nets worthy of Calipari and Kentucky cutting down, forget it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Johnny Melo wouldn't lie to us, would he?</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Besides, Calipari is going to appear on TV so often this month he will eventually figure out a good answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Just stay tuned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>With President Obama supporting his niece and the rest of Princeton's team a few rows from courtside, the Tigers managed to stay unbeaten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Sixth-seeded Xavier ended the biggest feel-good story of the NCAA Tournament with a 75-67 victory over Georgia State on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Villanova went from a top seed to No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>1-and-done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>N.C. State is back in the Sweet 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Rick Nash called Saturday night's visit to the Carolina Hurricanes a "must-win," and the Rangers triumphed, but it felt more like an escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>The Nets must have slept like babies on the team plane following Friday's thrilling triple overtime victory over Milwaukee in Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Rick Pitino has some choice words and ideas for one-and-done basketball players in the college game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>On the first official day of spring in Wellington Village Park, the basketball courts have once again become the streets of New York City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>St. John's coach Steve Lavin sounded very optimistic on Saturday that he would be coaching the Red Storm next season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Aaron Harrison scored 13 points, Trey Lyles added 11 with 11 rebounds and top-ranked Kentucky outworked Cincinnati.</td></tr>
