<h3>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud trails in last polls days before Israel election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Poll results in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper on Friday gave the Zionist Union, comprised of labor and a center-left party, 26 seats over 22 for Netanyahu's hawkish Likud party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It polled 1,032 people with a margin of error of 2.5 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Other polls had similar results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The March 17 election is widely seen as a vote of confidence in Netanyahu, whose campaign mainly focuses on security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But after years of rapidly increasing living costs, many Israelis are turning to dovish and centrist parties that focus on social and economic issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Netanyahu showed concern over the declining numbers in local media this week and called on his supporters to turn out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a sign of internal discontent in Likud, Dan Meridor, a former leading Likud politician, told Yediot he will not vote for Netanyahu.</td></tr>
