<h3>Gunmen storm Kenyan college campus in Garissa: media</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police who encircled the campus at the Garissa University College were joined by Kenyan soldiers as the standoff continued over several hours, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper and Capital FM radio station reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A policewoman at the scene told Reuters two security guards at the campus had been killed and the gunmen were likely to have taken hostages because many students remain trapped inside the campus in the town of Garissa.</td></tr>
