<h3>Hillary Clintonâ€™s latest e-mail mess</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>So much for Hillary Clinton's claim last March that "there is no classified material" on the private e-mail server she used for official business as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A review by two inspectors general found that four of just 40 e-mails sampled (out of 30,000-plus) contained material that should have been marked "secret," the second-highest classification level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And unlike material only later deemed classified, these e-mails were - at least, in effect - "classified when they were sent and are classified now," according to a spokeswoman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Which is why the intelligence community's inspector general referred the matter to the FBI's counterintelligence division, according to The Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Justice Department sources initially confirmed that the referral was criminal in nature - though, late Friday, the agency reversed course without explanation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The two IGs confirmed they'd made a "security referral for counterintelligence purposes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They said the e-mails "should have been handled as classified, appropriately marked and transmitted via secure network" and "should never have been transmitted" over Clinton's private server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>All of which puts Hillary's longstanding claim about not sending sensitive information via her server in doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And whether her goal was to thumb her nose at calls for transparency or, as she preposterously claims, for mere convenience, her private e-mail system was clearly an abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>What's more, this may be just the start: The results of this limited review suggest hundreds of other e-mails may contain classified information as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>(As for those Team Hillary decided were irrelevant and destroyed, the public may never know.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Again: Hillary's private server represented an outrageous flouting of the rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since its discovery, she's been anything but forthright.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We are all accountable to the American people to get the facts right," Hillary insisted Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>We'd say it's long past time that principle were applied to her.</td></tr>
