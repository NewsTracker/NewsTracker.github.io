<h3>General: 8,500 Islamic State fighters killed in Iraq so far</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq has killed more than 8,500 Islamic State fighters since its bombing campaign began in August and has gained the upper hand, the top general overseeing the coalition said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Austin, the commander of U.S. Central Command, said the Islamic State, which has controlled key parts of northern and western Iraq since last summer, is no longer capable of seizing and holding new territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP Photo/John Milburn, File).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Iran's direct support for an Iraqi push to dislodge the Islamic State group from the northern city of Tikrit could turn out to be "a positive thing" if it does not inflame sectarian tensions, the top U.S. general said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The statement by Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reflected the delicate balance Washington is trying to strike between limiting Iranian influence and allowing Iraqi leaders to determine their own path to defeating the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>U.S. officials have said Iraq did not ask the U.S. to provide air support for the Tikrit offensive, even though the U.S.-led military coalition has been conducting airstrikes in much of Iraq since August and has deployed hundreds of U.S. soldiers to try to regenerate an Iraqi army that collapsed last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dempsey said Iran and its proxies have been operating inside Iraq since 2004, but the Tikrit campaign signals a new level of involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is the most overt conduct of Iranian support, in the form of artillery and other things," Dempsey said in response to questions from members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Frankly, it will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said that about two-thirds of the force seeking to retake Tikrit is comprised of Iranian-based Shiite militia fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Iraqi government troops make up the other third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tikrit, the hometown of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, is a predominantly Sunni city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If they perform in a credible way" and rid Tikrit of Islamic State control, "then it will, in the main, have been a positive thing in terms of the counter-ISIL campaign," Dempsey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. general overseeing the military coalition fighting in Iraq told a House panel that the campaign has killed more than 8,500 Islamic State fighters since its bombing campaign began in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, the commander of U.S. Central Command, said the Islamic State, which has controlled key parts of northern and western Iraq since last summer, is no longer capable of seizing and holding new territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Austin said that in addition to killing at least 8,500 Islamic State fighters, the U.S.-led bombing has destroyed "hundreds" of the group's vehicles, tanks and heavy weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The bombing also has degraded the group's ability to generate revenue by striking oil refineries and crude oil collection sites, particularly in neighboring Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The fact is that he can no longer do what he did at the outset, which is to seize and to hold new territory," Austin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Austin made the remarks in his prepared statement at a hearing on President Barack Obama's request for new legal authority to execute the military campaign against the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Austin is a former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The general was speaking amid new uncertainty about the direction of the battle against the Islamic State as Iraqi forces, including Iranian-supported Shiite militias, opened a counteroffensive against the Islamic State in the city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Asked about Iran's military participation in the battle for Tikrit, which began on Monday, Austin did not describe the nature or extent of Iranian involvement but stated flatly, "There is no cooperation between U.S. and Iranian forces."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The general said U.S. intelligence sources allowed him to foresee Iran's involvement in the Tikrit fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The activity in Tikrit was no surprise," Austin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I saw this coming many days leading up to this. It's a logical progression of what they have been doing in the east of the country, but we don't coordinate with them," he added, referring to the Iranians.</td></tr>

<h3>From dated to darling! See this bedroom's major makeover</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>See how she and her husband transformed their dingy, multicolored space into a subdued, calming sanctuary - with a daring open closet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The original room was outdated and painted in all sorts of bright colors - totally antithetical to Marder's serene aesthetic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The before version was dark, dated and every single surface was painted a different color, so our main priority was getting the base - the walls, ceiling and floors - fresh and bright again," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Knowing what magic a coat of paint can work, Marder splashed a fresh coat on the dirty vinyl floor - as well as the walls, ceiling, window and door frames, radiators and heating pipes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The resulting look was clean and fresh on a budget, and with minimal effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The bedroom is not very big.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The couple chose to use the larger room that encompasses the third floor of their house as Marder's work studio, so they were working with a size challenge in the smaller room they chose for sleep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Keeping the walls, floor and ceiling white would keep the space feeling fresh and light, and not emphasize how little the space actually is," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A visual trick for making the space feel larger?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They placed a high shelf near the ceiling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It draws the eye upward and lengthens out the room," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While already a tidy person, Marder said she's long wanted an open closet for the look and ease of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So the couple chose IKEA rolling racks and open shelving with baskets to store their clothes instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Not only was it a cost-effective option, but if we have put in a built-in closet the room would have reduced drastically in size - it's just too small. [The open closet is] now my favorite aspect of this room," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The couple worked in phases, completing the job in about two weeks of work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Some days, [we were] so exhausted with renovating that we couldn't even bring ourselves to attempt any work, but stripping, cleaning, sanding and painting the original wooden floors took my husband several days to do," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It was a big job!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Above the bed is a gallery that mixes old and new, original and prints - even a framed set of real butterflies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Most of the artworks were antique market finds (Marder said she's addicted to vintage art).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>An accordion lamp on the wall is another one of her favorite vintage finds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Marder describes her style as a mix of both old and new aesthetics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>To that end, she loves scouring for vintage or antique pieces to mix with contemporary elements - and lives for the thrill of the chase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>She found a pair of marble-topped tables, and uses just one as a bedside table for a sense of asymmetry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"It gives me joy to give a lovely old thing a new lease on life. Living in the Netherlands, we have access to lots of antique shops and vintage markets, so every summer I'm out on my bike hitting the markets in the hopes of finding treasure."</td></tr>
