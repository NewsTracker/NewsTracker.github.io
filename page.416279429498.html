<h3>Pro-Russian journalist gunned down in Ukraine's capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Oles Buzyna, 45, was killed early Thursday afternoon by two masked men shooting from a passing car, the Ukrainian interior ministry said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Buzyna, who ran for a seat in parliament on the Russian Bloc ticket in 2012, was largely perceived as an activist rather than a journalist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He had a three-month stint as the editor-in-chief of Segodnya, a newspaper owned by Rinat Akhmetov " a Russia-leaning tycoon believed to be Ukraine's richest man " before he resigned in March citing censorship pressures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin, during his annual televised call-in show, was informed by the moderator of reports of Buzyna's death and immediately said "this is not the first political killing in Ukraine, there's a series of such killings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The killing is particularly ominous following another high-profile death on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Oleh Kalashnikov, a lawmaker from ex-President Viktor Yanukovych's party, was found dead on the landing of his home in Kiev with a gunshot wound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police would not immediately say whether he was murdered or killed himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Another prominent Russian politician, the chairman of the upper parliament house's foreign affairs committee, also denounced Buzyna's death as political.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"How many more victims will it take for the world to realize that in Ukraine there are deliberate political killings time after time," said Konstantin Kosachev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, said in a Facebook post that Buzyna " like Kalashnikov " was a key witness in a criminal case related to pro-Russian activists who in early 2014 attacked the pro-Western protests on Kiev's main square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The protests eventually led to the ouster of the Kremlin-friendly Yanukovych, who fled the country in February last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Herashchenko called on all witnesses in the case or anyone who might have information about it to contact the police if they fear for their safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The minister said the killings "could be" orchestrated by Russia in order to "destabilize the situation in Ukraine from within."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko also linked the two deaths, blaming them on the country's "enemies" who try to "discredit the political choice of the Ukrainian people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf condemned the murders and called for "a complete, thorough, and transparent investigation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dunja Mijatovic, representative for freedom of the media at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, also condemned Buzyna's murder and urged for an immediate investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Monday, another Ukrainian journalist was killed in Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police say Sergei Sukhobok died in a fight with neighbors with whom he had been feuding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sukhobok worked for a Donetsk-based news website that focused on business affairs in eastern Ukraine and had criticized the tycoon Akhmetov.</td></tr>
