<h3>FIFA tweaks rules for reforms task force</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA tweaks appointment rules for reforms task force because 11 member panel considered lacking in independence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA has changed composition rules for a task force criticised as lacking credibility to drive reforms after a corruption crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An 11-member panel announced last week to propose ideas at a September 24-25 FIFA executive committee meeting was widely judged to lack independence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Changes such as limiting terms in office, publishing salaries and stricter integrity checks can be passed February 26 at the presidential election meeting to replace Sepp Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FIFA now says "an independent person from outside" football will lead the task force, instead of a "neutral chairman."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was unclear Monday if FIFA audit committee chairman Domenico Scala refused the role or was unacceptable to confederation presidents making the appointment.</td></tr>
