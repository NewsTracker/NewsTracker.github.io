<h3>Artist mad Clinton portrait with Lewinsky reference isn't on display</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Artist Nelson Shanks works on a portrait of former president Bill Clinton in his Andalusia, Pa., studio in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Monica Lewinsky's scandalous blue dress is casting a shadow once again -- this time on the shelf life of a presidential portrait, alleges its artist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nelson Shanks recently attracted media attention for saying a portrait he painted of President Bill Clinton for the National Portrait Gallery includes a subtle reference to Monica Lewinsky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The reason for the headline-grabbing revelation?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Shanks said he is frustrated the painting is not on public display in the museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Shanks tells the USA TODAY Network that he believes the picture, which includes a subtle shadow cast by a blue dress, was removed because of pressure from the Clinton family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, an intern in the White House at the time, was a "primary scandal" during Clinton's presidency, Shanks says, and he wanted to allude to that in the piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Maybe (the painting) doesn't look as formal as they wanted," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I rather doubt that they got the Lewinsky angle. I was never going to mention it to anyone, but with the tremendous mistreatment on my part in that it's been spirited away, I felt this was a good stimulus to open a conversation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The National Portrait Gallery commonly rotates through exhibits and sometimes work is removed from public view for a period of time, Bethany Bentley, a spokesperson for the museum told the USA TODAY Network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It was not taken off view because of any outside requests," Bentley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The gallery has space for 900 works to be displayed at any one time out of a collection of more than 22,000 items, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The gallery unveiled the portrait to the public in 2006 and it hung on and off through August of 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In 2011, it was on loan for a traveling display in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The gallery does not have any future rotations scheduled right now, according to Bentley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's been cycled right down to the storage area permanently," Shanks said about the painting's more-than-five-year hiatus from the gallery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Shanks sees himself as a biographer and said his portraits capture the subject's personality and story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>For Clinton, that meant portraying the 42nd president in a casual pose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"In the presidency, [Clinton] had a certain amount of panache, a little bit of swagger. He didn't stand nor act like a mannequin. That swagger and that sense of self was very present and I tried to get exactly that in the painting," Shanks said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Another undeniable part of his legacy is Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I felt it necessary to depart from complete naivete in the painting and put in a subtle, subtle shadow across his presidency," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>To get the right effect, Shanks says he went through various props for something to cast the shadow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That's when he happened upon a blue dress and decided it was fitting since Lewinsky's blue dress, which had DNA that matched Clinton's, became a central part of the scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A photo taken by USA TODAY in 2005 shows Shanks in his studio working on the painting with a blue dress hanging on coat rack casting a shadow onto the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>With a replica of the fireplace in the Oval Office set up in his studio, artist Nelson Shanks works on a portrait of former president Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There is a blue dress set up in the studio casting a shadow on the set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Shanks recently told reporters that the shadow represents Monica Lewinsky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Shanks said the decision to talk about the Lewinsky reference at this time has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton possibly running for president in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"I've spent quite a bit of time with her and I like her," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A spokesperson for the Clinton family could not immediately be reached for comment.</td></tr>

<h3>Hillary Clinton may have broken federal record-keeping laws</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have violated federal records laws by using a personal email account for all of her work messages, the New York Times reported on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The newspaper said the likely Democratic presidential candidate conducted all her official business during her four-year tenure at the State Department on a private email account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It added that Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state in 2013, recently handed over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department in response to a department effort to comply with record-keeping practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Federal law says letters and emails written and received by federal officials are government records that must be retained, according to the paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Regulations at the time Clinton served as secretary of state called for emails on personal accounts to be preserved as well, the paper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Times said most experts believed private email accounts should only be used for official government business in emergencies, according to the Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A spokesman for Clinton told the Times that Clinton was complying with the "letter and spirit of the rules" and had expected her emails would be retained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He declined to detail why she chose to conduct business from her personal account, the Times said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Responding to the report, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the department last year asked former secretaries of state through their representatives to submit any records in their possession to improve record-keeping and management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In response to our request, Secretary Clinton provided the department with emails spanning her time at the department," Harf said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Clinton's spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton is widely considered the front-runner for next year's Democratic presidential nomination if she decides to enter the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Her inner circle is currently discussing accelerating the formation of a campaign organization to April or May instead of waiting until the summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With no definite opponents to the democratic presidential nomination, Clinton has felt no rush to jump into the race, but having a campaign team in place would allow her to respond forcefully to various accusations fired her way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It would also allow her to raise the millions of dollars needed for a campaign.</td></tr>
