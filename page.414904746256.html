<h3>White House mulls how to counter Netanyahu on Iran</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>President Barack Obama does not intend to be silent or out of sight when Netanyahu addresses Congress in a visit that was arranged by Speaker John Boehner behind the administration's back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The breach of protocol has grown to what seems like a grudge match between two men who dislike each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Vice President Biden will be out of town during Netanyahu's speech, leaving an empty chair behind the Israeli leader's podium and Secretary of State John Kerry may conveniently find a foreign trip to be on that day as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - In what has become an increasingly nasty grudge match, the White House is mulling ways to undercut Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming trip to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The administration wants to blunt his message that a potential nuclear deal with Iran is bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Officials have discarded the idea of President Barack Obama himself giving an Iran-related address to rebut the two speeches Netanyahu is to deliver during his early March visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But other options remain on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among them: a presidential interview with a prominent journalist known for coverage of the rift between Obama and Netanyahu, multiple television appearances by senior national security aides and a possible snub of America's leading pro-Israel lobby.</td></tr>
