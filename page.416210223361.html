<h3>'Suge' Knight in court to hear if he will face murder trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A judge will determine whether there is enough proof to support murder, attempted-murder and hit-and-run charges against the Death Row Records co-founder, who has been jailed since late January after being accused of striking two men with his pickup truck outside a Compton burger stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Authorities contend Knight intentionally hit the men, killing Terry Carter, 55, and seriously injuring Cle "Bone" Sloan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Knight's attorney says his client was ambushed and was trying to escape an attack when he hit the men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FILE - In this March 9, 2015 file photo, Marion "Suge" Knight, center, arrives in court for a hearing about evidence in his murder case, in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Knight is due back in court Monday, April 13 for a hearing in which prosecutors will detail some of their evidence in a murder case against the former rap music mogul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A judge will determine whether there is enough evidence to support murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges against the Death Row Records co-founder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sloan was the first witness Monday, testifying that he does not recall the immediate events leading up to the crash and that he does not want to be a "snitch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I will not be used to send Suge Knight to prison," he said, adding that he was only on the stand because he was subpoenaed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Knight, 49, was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs - he fired one set of attorneys during a hearing and medical conditions sent him to the hospital four times from courthouse appearances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He complained last week when deputies brought him into court handcuffed to a wheelchair and has detailed health woes, including weight loss and blindness in one eye, when he's been allowed to speak in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The appearance of fragility comes in sharp contrast to Knight's violent reputation and his once-feared status in the music industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He faces up to life in prison if convicted of killing Carter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The 49-year-old Knight is being held on $25 million bail, an amount his attorney, Matt Fletcher, has argued is excessive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Prosecutors must only show a fraction of their evidence and testimony to convince a judge that Knight should be tried.</td></tr>
