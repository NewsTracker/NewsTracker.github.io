<h3>Ferguson presses several-hour, unity-minded cleanup effort ahead of Brown anniversary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FERGUSON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- One of the areas hardest hit by last year's unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, that followed the police shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown is getting a little sprucing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hundreds of volunteers converged Monday morning on West Florissant Avenue for a litter-pickup and weeding effort spearheaded by KMOX Radio personality Charlie Brennan ahead of the Aug. 9 one-year anniversary of Brown's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An organizer, Roy Gillespie, says the cleanup was less about beautification than it was about building regional unity by drawing in Ferguson residents and outsiders to pitch in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The hub of Monday's event was the site of a former QuikTrip store that was looted and torched the night after Brown was shot and killed roughly a half mile away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The property will become a job training and placement center.</td></tr>
