<h3>What Europe’s leaders are saying about Greece’s future</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>What Europe's leaders are saying about Greece's future Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>I am not very worried about a technical solution for Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>I think a solution can be found, even quite easily, to solve Greece's emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I am a bit more worried about the situation of Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In its current state, Europe is not good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A technical solution for Greece can be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>What is more important is to find a political solution for Europe and on this there is still a lot to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>What's next for Greece?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Where to be is up to the Greek governors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>I think from their point of view there is strong interest to stay in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To stay in the euro one must follow rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>These rules can be interpreted with a bit of flexibility but as all euro zone countries know, they must be followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Therefore this decision in the end depends on the Greek government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I believe that they will do everything to reach a deal and I think that, not today but in the coming hours, this deal can be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>We can't do it with a gun to our head or a knife at our throats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A prime minister has to face up to his responsibilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If there's nothing on the table and there continues to be nothing on the table, that means Tsipras is not able to honour the demand of the Greek people to stay in the euro zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>If there are no proposals, he bears a heavy responsibility towards his own people first and the euro zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>What do we want?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>For Greece to stay in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To get there, Greece must make serious, credible proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>We are waiting for them and they have already been announced, they must be fleshed out now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It's the issue for tonight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The onus is on Greece to make some proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It's up to Europe to show solidarity by giving them a medium-term outlook, with immediate aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>We are not going to speak about Greece every three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Finally we need speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It's this week that the decisions have to be taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>After the expiry of the second [bailout] program and after more than clear 'No' in the Greek referendum, there is still no basis for negotiations in the ESM program framework.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>We still believe that solidarity at a European level and responsibility at a national level, what each side is offering, are inseparably linked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In other words, without solidarity there is no possibility to help, without solidarity and reforms it's not possible to go where we want to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>At the council we will talk about how we'll continue but we won't be able to paint the final pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I say it's not a matter of weeks but of a few days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>We will see what the Greek Prime Minister will tell us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>I'm very cheerless about this summit and I'm very cheerless about the fact whether Greece wants to come with proposals at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It seems they have put the old proposals on the table again, if we can believe the reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The only solution is for Greece to make far-reaching reforms and implement difficult measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The fate of Greece in the euro and the responsibility is in Athens, not here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The Greek government is taking a large risk with the interests of the Greek people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>I'm here to keep up the integrity, the cohesion and the underlying principles of the monetary un-ion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>It's up to the Greek government to come with the far-reaching proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>If they don't, I think it will be over soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>| The fact is: If the Greeks don't today or very soon because time has already run out, come up with far reaching proposals, are prepared to implement difficult measures we won't be able to help them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>In that case the responsibility will be with the Greek government.</td></tr>
