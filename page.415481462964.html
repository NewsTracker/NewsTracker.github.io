<h3>Netanyahu legacy on the line in Israeli vote</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>If Netanyahu can lead his Likud Party to victory and secure a fourth term in office, he will be well on his way to overtaking the nation's iconic founding father, David Ben-Gurion, as the longest-ever serving premier _ and cementing a status as the dominant Israeli politician of the past two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - As Israelis prepare to vote in parliament elections on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds himself at a fateful crossroads: Make history or become history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If Netanyahu can lead his Likud Party to victory and secure a fourth term in office, he will move closer to overtaking the nation's iconic founding father, David Ben-Gurion, as the longest-ever serving premier - and cementing a status as the dominant Israeli politician of the past two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But if Likud stumbles and finds itself in the opposition - a real possibility, according to recent polls - the Netanyahu era could end with a resounding thud, concluding a career that many would say brought few major accomplishments beyond longevity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Iran and the international community seem headed toward a nuclear deal that Netanyahu abhors, and a resolution to the Palestinian issue seems as distant as ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If he leaves office, he won't leave any dramatic changes," said Yoaz Hendel, a former aide to Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a turbulent region, one could say "this is the best thing to do," Hendel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Israeli campaign is widely seen as a choice between two world views: Netanyahu's focus on Israel's many security challenges - he has long been a voice calling for zero tolerance of terrorism - or his opponents' focus on Israel's social problems and high cost of living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It also touches on his support for Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the opposition and the outside world detest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But on a basic level, the campaign is simply a referendum on Netanyahu, a polarizing character who is adored as "King Bibi" by his supporters and reviled by his detractors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The son of a Jewish historian, and scarred by the loss of his brother in a 1976 Israeli commando raid on a hijacked airline in Uganda, Netanyahu often portrays himself - and his country - in historical terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He laces his speeches with references to Jewish history, tales of Jewish heroism and warnings that Israel's most sinister enemies lurk around every corner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The main target of his diatribes, Iran, is often compared to biblical enemies and even the Nazis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over," Netanyahu said in a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We are no longer scattered among the nations, powerless to defend ourselves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was vintage Netanyahu, delivered in flawless, American-accented English - developed during a childhood in Philadelphia and later as a university student at MIT - and with the gifted oratorical flourish that has made him prominent on the international stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>His stern rhetorical style, often drawing comparisons to Churchill, has served him well during a three-decade career that has included time at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, as ambassador to the United Nations, a series of senior Cabinet posts and a stint as opposition leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He has spent a total of nine years as prime minister since 1996, and if he can keep the post through mid-2019, he will become the country's longest serving premier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But after enjoying a surge of popularity following last summer's war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu is struggling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Despite the speech to Congress, his efforts to halt the Iranian nuclear program - which he describes as the mission of his lifetime - appear to be stumbling as the U.S. seems to move toward a deal with the Islamic Republic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The speech, delivered over White House objections, has worsened an already troubled relationship with President Barack Obama, boding poorly for the final two years of Obama's term if Netanyahu is re-elected.</td></tr>

<h3>Fashionable pink: Ros? wine is conquering the world</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>We got into wine, gastronomy and travel for passion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>We love what we do and want to share it with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We" means Per and Britt, husband and wife team, Swedish nationals but based in Paris since long, very long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>We have contributed to numerous wine publications and now publish our own online wine ezine, BKWine Magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Our five wine books have won national and international awards, e.g. Best Wine Book in the World for Professionals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>We also run a wine travel business, BKWine Tours (listed as "world's best wine tours"), that takes us travelling around the world's wine regions a third of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>We both visit some 200 wineries each year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Britt has been listed on Wine Business International's Wine Media Power List and Per was in a previous life Vice President of an international tech company and an INSEAD alumni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Oh yes, we also have one of the world's biggest wine photography collections at BKWine Photography.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>You can connect with us through one of our BKWine sites, or on Facebook, or on twitter @bkwineper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rose wine is no longer only a summer wine to be drunk on a sunny terrace, preferably in Provence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Rose wine is actually the height of fashion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It is no longer looked down upon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is trendy and the quality is so much better than it used to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Of all wine regions in the world, Provence in southern France is probably the pinkest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Here almost 90 % of the wine production is rose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And as more and more producers start to make ultra-premium rose wines the crucial question is: Can rose ever be a great wine?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Trendy or not, it is much easier to like rose wines nowadays as they are both fresher and drier in style.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They are more and more present on the dining table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The producers themselves recommend rose wines with everything from Asian cuisine to charcuterie, veal and chicken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The aromas of red berries are still prevalent in rose wines but as the structure is better and the acidity fresher they seem less juicy and more like a "real" wine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Of course, rose wines are still considered as being quite unpretentious by most consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But that doesn't mean they are easy to produce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It is technically challenging to make rose, say many producers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>You use technology from both white wine and red wine production.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>And to get the exact colour that you want is not as easy as one may think.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Provence produces a lot of rose and a big part of it is also consumed there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Tourists love to drink rose during their holidays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Spain, another sunny destination, also has a long tradition of rosado, a wine popular with tapas both among the locals and the tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>As I mentioned earlier, Provence is 90 % rose wines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Is that a bad thing?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Some people seem to think so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Red and white wine producers down there are frustrated that their wines don't get the attention they deserve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Certain wine journalists worry that Provence will never be considered a serious wine region again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>But rose wines have brought financial stability to the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>And if people are queueing to buy your rose wine why stop making it?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The colour is a great asset for rose and probably one reason why people like it so much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>So it is important to get the colour right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Pink is not one colour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It is hundreds of colours and shades.</td></tr>
