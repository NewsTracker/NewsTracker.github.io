<h3>UN appeals for $20 million for Vanuatu cyclone victims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday the money is needed to continue basic relief efforts including providing food, safe drinking water and shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The cyclone's winds of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour devastated much of the archipelago on March 13, killing 17 people and leaving about 65,000 homeless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A U.N. appeal for about $30 million was launched on March 24 to cover the needs of 166,000 cyclone-affected people for three months but Dujarric said that to date donors have given only $10.7 million, just 36 per cent.</td></tr>
