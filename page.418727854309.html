<h3>Geschke wins, Froome stays safe on Stage 17 in Alps (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BARCELONNETTE, France (AP) -- Simon Geschke of the Giant-Alpecin team won a tough and dangerous Stage 17 of the Tour de France in the Alps on Wednesday with a brave solo ride, while former champion Alberto Contador fell during a terrifying high-speed descent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Race leader Chris Froome staved off multiple attacks to get through the first of four days in the Alps unscathed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He showed great bike-handling skills on the 16-kilometer (10-mile) descent from the Col d'Allos mountain pass, where he hit speeds of 60 kph (40 mph) on the twisting, narrow bends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Geschke was first down that slope, having ridden off ahead with 50 kilometers (30 miles) still to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Showing how tricky the descent was, French rider Thibaut Pinot hit the deck when his wheels slipped from under him on a left-hand bend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It was really challenging,'' said Geschke, whose stage win was the fifth by a German rider on this Tour, and ideal for an event that is back on public TV in Germany after a hiatus of several years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Contador's shorts were torn in his crash on the descent, and the 2007 and 2009 champion was forced to swap bikes with teammate Peter Sagan, costing him time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He rode in more than two minutes after Froome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While the Spaniard stays in fifth place, the Tinkoff-Saxo leader who was hoping to add the Tour to his Giro d'Italia win in May is now a substantial six minutes and 40 seconds behind the Team Sky rider overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Froome and Nairo Quintana sprinted together for the line on the final ascent to the Pra Loup ski station, with the Colombian just beating the Briton this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Quintana is still second overall, with his 3:10 deficit to Froome unchanged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But Quintana was very active on the stage with five climbs, testing Froome with bursts of speed that the 2013 winner was forced to match, having identified the 2013 runner-up as his biggest rival again this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With time running out for podium contenders to claw back a few minutes, Froome is expecting more attacks in the next three days of progressively harder Alpine climbing before the largely ceremonial ride into Paris on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''My rivals are going to take bigger risks,''Froome said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tejay van Garderen, who had been third at the start of the 161-kilometer (100-mile) stage from Digne-Les-Bains, abandoned, with a headache and feeling out of energy after battling a respiratory infection for several days, his team doctor explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Alejandro Valverde, Quintana's Spanish teammate on the Movistar team and who is riding strongly, moved up from fourth to third overall, 4:09 behind Froome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Froome's Sky teammate Geraint Thomas moved up from sixth to fourth, vaulting over Contador, and is 6:34 behind his team leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''The best day of my life as a rider,'' Geschke said after holding off Andrew Talansky, the Cannondale-Garmin rider who was in hot pursuit on the final climb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''Just ran out of road,'' said Talansky, who took second in the stage, 32 seconds behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Riding solo for over an hour from such a long way out, up the two final climbs and alone down the hairy descent was risky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Geschke said he knew that other riders in his group were stronger climbers than him, so he decided to shake them off as early as he could.</td></tr>
