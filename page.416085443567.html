<h3>Won and done? Duke awaits NBA decisions from freshmen (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Now Duke waits to find out if any of those star freshmen will go won and done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Coach Mike Krzyzewski says in the coming days, he will discuss future plans with each of his players - including Jahlil Okafor, Justise Winslow and Tyus Jones, the most outstanding player at the Final Four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>All three players said Wednesday that nothing has been decided yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Okafor has said it's a ''business decision'' with some very emotional components: He and Jones have been friends since the third grade and planned for years to play college ball together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''For it to end after 9-10 months, it would kind of suck,'' Okafor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>During the on-campus rally to celebrate the program's fifth national title, Krzyzewski said this was ''my favorite year'' - a strong statement from a Hall of Fame coach with more than 1,000 career victories and five national championships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Duke (35-4) earned championship banner No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>5 with a 68-63 win over Wisconsin earlier this week in Indianapolis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''Whether guys go early or whatever, I really felt these guys never thought of'' the future, Krzyzewski said, adding that senior captain Quinn Cook ''was never thinking, where am I going to end up?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Like a lot of seniors in college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>... Those are things you don't teach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I think they have (those qualities).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He praised the players' camaraderie and their willingness to share the glory with each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''There's always somebody that came through during a game,'' Krzyzewski said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''And none of the guys cared who it was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Okafor led the team in scoring (17.5 points per game), rebounding (8.6 rebounds per game) and field-goal percentage (67 percent) - becoming the first freshman in program history to lead the team in all three categories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Without question, the freshman class - which also included title-game surprise Grayson Allen, who said the possibility of leaving early ''is not a question'' - was the backbone of this team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Those four combined to score 60 of the 68 points in the championship game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Duke was the only team in the country with three freshmen averaging double figures, and the Blue Devils were 23-2 when the Okafor-Winslow-Jones trio combined for at least 40 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>If they leave, another class of highly rated freshmen is coming in behind them: 6-foot-10 center Chase Jeter and 6-5 guard Luke Kennard - both five-star recruits - have signed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And Sean Obi, a 6-9 forward who averaged 11.4 points and nine rebounds at Rice in 2013-14, will be eligible after sitting out this season due to transfer rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He's the only scholarship player on the roster who wasn't a McDonald's All-American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''We knew (the title game) was more than likely going to be the last time we played with each other,'' guard Matt Jones said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Krzyzewski became the first Division I men's coach to push his career victory total into four figures, reaching the milestone with a 77-68 win over St. John's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>After Duke lost its next game at Notre Dame, Krzyzewski kicked a player off the team for the first time in his 35-year stint in Durham, dismissing Rasheed Sulaimon for reasons that remain not entirely clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>That left Duke with just eight available scholarship players - but that shortened roster went on to win 18 of its final 19 games, capped by that victory over the Badgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It made Krzyzewski only the second coach - joining UCLA's John Wooden - with a handful of NCAA Tournament titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''It's a hell of a feeling,'' Krzyzewski said of coaching a championship game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''And if you win it, forget it.</td></tr>
