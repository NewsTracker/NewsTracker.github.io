<h3>Ukraine suspends military cooperation with Russia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko leaves the presidential office before welcoming his Slovak counterpart in Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, May 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>KIEV, Ukraine - Ukraine's parliament on Thursday voted to suspend military co-operation with Russia in a long-anticipated move signalling a further break in relations between the once-close partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The five co-operation agreements scrapped by the Verkhovna Rada include one giving the Russian military transit rights to reach Moldova, whose territory is partly controlled by a Moscow-supported separatist government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Relations between Russia and Ukraine plummeted after the overthrow in February 2014 of Moscow-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kyiv also accuses Moscow of arming and staffing separatist insurgencies in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In turning away from Russia, Ukraine has increasingly reached out for assistance to NATO, an organization the current government hopes the country will eventually join.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Russia has about 1,500 troops stationed in Trans-Dniester, a landlocked separatist strip of Moldova that borders Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rescinding the transit rights for those troops creates a logistical problem for Russia and no solution was immediately apparent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"As it now stands, we have to think about it, find a way. We shouldn't toss away Trans-Dniester and Moldova," said Vladimir Komoedov, chairman of the defence committee of the lower house of the Russian parliament, according to the Interfax news agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he said Russia wouldn't consider retaliatory measures for the time being.</td></tr>
