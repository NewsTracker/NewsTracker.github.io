<h3>Ukraine evacuates hundreds from site of deadly Kiev fuel blasts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Ukrainian firefighter retreats from the fire at the fuel depot outside Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kiev: Hundreds of residents were evacuated from the site of a series of fuel depot blasts near the Ukrainian capital that set off a ferocious fire and left several people missing and at least one confirmed dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The defence ministry said it was also taking emergency measures to prevent the flames engulfing a nearby military airbase which has MiG-29 fighter jets and munitions on site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Security Council Secretary Oleksandr Turchynov and Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak rushed to the scene to oversee the rescue operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukrainian firemen tackle the blaze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are facing a serious threat... because 50 metres from the edge of the fire, we have a military installation stocked with an arsenal," Mr Turchynov said in televised comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The interior ministry said at least one person had died in the explosions in a leafy town called Vasylkiv about 30 kilometres south-west of Ukraine's capital Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Fourteen people - including seven rescue workers - were being treated for burns and other injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Residents living around the plant were evacuated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The lightning speed with which the flames spread to neighbouring petrol stations and fuel tanks resulted in initial confusion among emergency workers and contradictory toll reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said officials were still trying to establish contact with three of the 30 firemen who were intially sent to the spot of the first blast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But more explosions soon followed and dozens of additional firetrucks and ambulances were dispatched to the scene, where thick black smoke billowed into the sky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>An AFP reporter saw three underground fuel storage tanks on fire within a few hundred metres of the initial accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Videos posted on the Internet showed the force of the first explosion and the heatwave it produced setting ablaze several firetrucks and ambulances that had been rushed to the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A fireman wearing a silver heat-resistant suit and mask was seen running away from the disaster for his own safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Everyone - leave. Whoever is still here - leave," one fireman said in a video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ukraine's emergencies ministry began evacuating residents living within two kilometres of the fuel depots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"If necessary, we will evacuate people living within 10 kilometres," the ministry statement added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kiev has been suffering from a dry heat spell that has seen temperatures soar towards 30 degrees for more than a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Security Council chief Mr Turchynov said the accident most likely resulted from human error and "safety rule violations".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"But the second possibility is sabotage," he added in televised comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The damaged fuel depots are owned by a Ukrainian company called BRSM-Nafta that operates a chain of petrol stations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>BRSM-NAfta spokesman Oleksandr Melnychuk said several explosive devices had been discovered near his company's storage tankers since last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We view this as an attempt to put pressure on the company owner," Mr Melnychuk said in a telephone interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"They wanted to nationalise [the company] - to take it away from us."</td></tr>
