<h3>Volcano erupts in southern Chile</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An estimated 3,400 people were evacuated from the area around Villarica, including parts of the towns Pucon and Conaripe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chilean authorities issued a red alert and sealed off roads surrounding the volcano, located in a tourist enclave outside the city of Temuco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The president, Michelle Bachelet, announced an emergency visit to the zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Government planes flew over the crater in an attempt to gather data following the 20-minute pre-dawn eruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The eruption followed weeks of increased activity in and around the volcano, including small earthquakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The snow-covered peak has a crater 180 metres across and a pool of lava estimated at 120 metres (400ft) deep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Considered one of Latin America's most active volcanoes, Villarica has erupted on average once every 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A major eruption in 1971 created a cloud of poisonous gases that killed approximately a dozen people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Authorities are concerned that lava and heat from the latest eruption could melt glaciers and snow on the flanks of the volcano and cause mudslides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Rio Turbio river was reported to have risen 15ft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Schools were shut in the four districts closest to the volcano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Police patrols to the area were increased to prevent looting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 2010 Bachelet was widely criticised for her response to an earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The emergency services agency known as the Onemi was reorganised and is now coordinated by a former army general, Ricardo Toro, who for years managed international humanitarian operations in Haiti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>If the volcano shows signs of increased activity, Onemi will next organise the evacuation of an estimated 20,000 more people from Pucon and the surrounding area.</td></tr>
