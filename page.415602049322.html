<h3>Elephant rib shows early signs of prehistoric BUTCHERY: Animal residue found on ancient tools unearthed in Israel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Researchers analysing elephant remains in Israel have discovered signs of animal residue on primitive tools called 'handaxes and scrapers' alongside cut marks in the remains themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And by replicating the flint tools for a modern butchering experiment they said the 'handaxe was prehistoric man's 'Swiss army knife' - capable of breaking down bone, sinew and hide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Researchers analysing elephant remains (rib pictured) in Israel have discovered signs of animal residue on primitive tools called 'handaxes and scrapers' alongside cut marks in the remains themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The slimmer, more delicate scraper was then used to separate fur and animal fat from muscle tissue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The tools and remains were discovered at a Lower Paleolithic site in Revadim, Israel, by Professor Ran Barkai, Natasha Solodenko and Andrea Zupanchich from Tel Aviv University's Department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Cultures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The team used a process called 'use-wear analysis' which involves examining the surfaces and edges of the tools to determine their function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The researchers studied three tools found in the Revadim quarry in Israel - a flake, biface or 'handaxe' and scraper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>No use-traces or identifiable residue was found on the flake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The biface and scraper both revealed 'well preserved and clear use-wear traces'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The biface use traces indicate the processing of 'medium-hard material' believed to be evidence of hide scraping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The scraper instead featured traces of 'soft or medium material'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This is believed to be animal tissue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Both tools showed residue of adipocere, or animal fat and on the scraper, both tissues and vegetable residues were found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It also used so-called Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) residue analysis to identify organic residue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>FTIR uses infrared to identify bio-signatures of prehistoric compounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>From this, the researchers were able to demonstrate for the first time direct proof of animal exploitation by flint tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'There are three parts to this puzzle: the expansion of the human brain, the shift to meat consumption, and the ability to develop sophisticated technology to meet the new biological demands,' Professor Barkai said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Fracturing rocks in order to butcher and cut animal meat is said to represent a key biological and cultural milestone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'At the Revadim quarry we found butchered animal remains, including an elephant rib bone which had been neatly cut by a stone tool, alongside flint handaxes and scrapers still retaining animal fat,' continued Professor Barkai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The tools and remains were discovered at a Lower Paleolithic site in Revadim, Israel (marked).</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The team used 'use-wear analysis' to examine the surfaces and edges of the tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The researchers studied three tools: a flake, biface (pictured) and scraper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>No use-traces or identifiable residue were found on the flake but the biface and scraper both revealed 'clear use-wear traces'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The scraper (pictured) instead featured traces of 'soft or medium material'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The paper said the tools would have also been used to process hides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Prehistoric peoples made use of all parts of the animal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In the case of the elephant, for example, they would have needed to use both tools to manage such a challenging task.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'The knowledge of how to make these tools was precious, and must have been passed along from generation to generation, because these tools were reproduced the same way across great territorial expanses and over hundreds of thousands of years,' said Professor Barkai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>'In this thousand-piece puzzle called archaeology, sometimes we find pieces that connect other pieces together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The research, published in Plos One, was done in collaboration with Dr Stella Ninziante Cesaro and Dr Cristina Lemorini of La Sapienza, University of Rome, and Dr Ofer Marder of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The damaged edge of the scraper is shown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>'In this thousand-piece puzzle called archaeology, sometimes we find pieces that connect other pieces together,' said lead researcher Professor Ran Barkai.</td></tr>

<h3>Niger troops say find mass grave outside town taken from Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The sources said investigations were underway to establish the number of bodies and that they were awaiting the arrival of Nigerian authorities to take charge of the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Niger and Chad's troops have discovered a mass grave at Damasak, which appears to contain the bodies of Boko Haram's victims," said one of the military sources, who asked not to be identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The dusty streets of Damasak were largely deserted following its liberation on Saturday, after many inhabitants had fled the Islamists' four-month rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Shops and businesses were looted and Boko Haram's black and white insignia were scrawled on buildings around the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The military sources said they had requested Nigeria's military to occupy the town, which lies close to the border with Niger, but had yet to receive a response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"As far as I know, as of yesterday, the Nigerian army has still not arrived in the area. We are waiting," said one of the sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The regional offensive launched this year by Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Nigeria comes as Africa's most populous country and biggest economy prepares to hold presidential elections on March 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At the start of this year, Boko Haram controlled around 20 local government areas, a territory the size of Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>With the help of foreign allies, Nigeria's army said on Tuesday it pushed the rebels out of all but three districts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to tackle the insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>His challenger Muhammadu Buhari has campaigned on a reputation for toughness gained when he was military ruler of Nigeria in the 1980s.</td></tr>
