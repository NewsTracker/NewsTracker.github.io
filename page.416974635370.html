<h3>Body of 12-Year-Old Boy Shot by Police in November Cremated</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The body of a 12-year-old boy shot dead by police at a Cleveland playground six months ago has been cremated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Family attorney Walter Madison says Tamir Rice's mother made the decision last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tamir had an airsoft gun that shoots nonlethal plastic pellets when a rookie officer fatally shot him Nov. 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A police union official says the officer had no way of knowing Tamir wasn't carrying a real firearm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Madison has sued the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He says in a legal case Tamir's cause of death would be an issue and there was concern there may need to be independent examination of his body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Madison says grief-stricken mother Samaria Rice "had to put him to rest in order to begin to move on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A sheriff has said the investigation into Tamir's shooting is nearly complete.</td></tr>
