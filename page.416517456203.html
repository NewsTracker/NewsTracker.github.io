<h3>Powerful earthquake strikes Nepal: Things to Know</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A powerful earthquake struck the Nepal region on Saturday, causing widespread casualties and triggering an avalanche on Mount Everest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's too early to tell, but early indications suggest the figure of nearly 1,400 people killed in four countries is likely to rise substantially in the coming days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The magnitude-7.8 quake was the worst to hit Nepal in eight decades and caused damage and fatalities in neighboring countries as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In addition to nearly 1,400 people killed in Nepal, at least 34 were killed in India, 12 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Two Chinese citizens died at the Nepal-China border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The earthquake hit a heavily populated area of Nepal, including the capital, Kathmandu, and its impact spread far beyond the Kathmandu Valley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Strong aftershocks were felt an hour after the initial temblor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Earthquake experts are preparing for high numbers in terms of deaths and damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is a very large earthquake in a significantly populated region with infrastructure that has been damaged in past earthquakes," U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Significant fatalities are expected."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Local hospitals were already filling with injured residents, and Kathmandu's international airport was shut down, hampering initial relief efforts in the isolated mountainous country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>WHAT HAPPENED?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Seismologist Earle said the quake happened on what is known as a "thrust fault."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That describes the situation when one piece of the Earth's crust is moving beneath another piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In this case, it's the Indian plate that is moving north at 45 millimeters (1.7 inches) a year under the Eurasian plate to the north, Earle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It's a different type of earthquake than the one that caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"This is what builds the Himalayan mountain range," Earle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The region and particular fault has a history of damaging earthquakes, including four temblors with magnitudes greater than 6.0 in the past 100 years, Earle said, warning that landslides are a particular worry now, given the steep slopes in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>WHAT DOES 'RED ALERT' ISSUED BY U.S. OFFICIALS MEAN?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was strong enough to merit a "red alert" for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It said that "high casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread. Past red alerts have required a national or international response."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Quick USGS calculations estimate a two-thirds likelihood of between 1,000 and 100,000 fatalities and damage between $100 million and $10 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Scientists estimate that more than 105 million people felt at least moderate shaking during the quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>WHAT HAPPENED ON MOUNT EVEREST?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A devastating avalanche swept across Mount Everest after the quake, claiming at least eight lives with an unspecified number of people missing and injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The avalanche struck near one of the famed mountain's most dangerous spots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It swept down between the Khumbu Icefall, known for its harsh conditions, and the base camp used by international climbing expeditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>There were unverified reports of avalanches on other parts of the mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Nepalese officials said some 30 people were injured at the base camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Facebook postings by climbers suggested that some people may have been buried in their tents when the avalanche hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Climbers and their support teams were leaving the base camp Saturday looking for safer locations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>More than 4,000 climbers have scaled the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>HOW PREPARED IS NEPAL TO COPE WITH SUCH A CRISIS?</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Nepal is a relatively poor country without extensive resources despites its rich cultural heritage and spectacular mountain scenery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>It has been plagued by instability in recent years, and general strikes have recently brought chaotic scenes to Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Nepal's constitution was supposed to have been written by the Constituent Assembly that was elected in 2008, following the end of a 10-year Maoist insurgency and the overthrow of the centuries-old monarchy, but the assembly was hampered by infighting and never finished its work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The current assembly was chosen in 2013, but has faced the same problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Neighboring Pakistan has offered help, and an international aid effort is likely to begin once Kathmandu's international airport can be reopened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>An injured child receives treatment outside Medicare Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, Saturday, April 25, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>A strong magnitude-7.9 earthquake shook Nepal's capital and the densely populated Kathmandu Valley before noon Saturday, causing extensive damage with toppled walls and collapsed buildings, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>People rest on debris at Durbar Square after an earthquake in Kathmandu, Nepal, Saturday, April 25, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Rescuers remove debris at the historic Dharahara tower, a city landmark, after an earthquake in Kathmandu, Nepal, Saturday, April 25, 2015.</td></tr>
