<h3>A look at what's keeping Greece, creditors from a bailout deal despite growing risk of default</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek flags flutter as people walk down a central pedestrian street of Athens, on Tuesday, April 14, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greece's new left wing-led government has been locked in strained negotiations with creditors since winning elections in January on pledges to abolish the deeply resented budget austerity measures required by the rescue program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - By the day, Greece is getting closer to a potentially catastrophic debt default that could force it out of the euro bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>All it needs to avoid that fate is a deal with its creditors to get more loans - yet weeks of wrangling over the terms have produced no sign of progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The situation is coming to a head, with Greece struggling to meet debt obligations on a weekly basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It faces repayments worth 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) next month that it may be unable to afford without more rescue loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rescue creditors - fellow eurozone states and the International Monetary Fund - want Greece to agree to a list of economic reforms that the country's new government came to power promising to oppose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece's finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, will have a chance to meet officials from the IMF and other key creditors at a global conference Washington this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But both Athens and rescue creditors concede that a breakthrough is unlikely by an end-of-April deadline they set to unlock a batch of bailout loans, delayed from last summer and worth 7.2 billion euros ($7.7 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Here's a look at why, despite the high stakes, the two sides remain at an impasse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Eurozone states and the IMF say they cannot keep pouring billions of euros of rescue funds into a country that refuses to modernize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The country's crisis, they argue, was caused by gorging on cheap loans after joining Europe's common currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>So reforms should focus on reducing costs in the Greek economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Since Athens started getting 240 billion euros in bailout loans in 2010 it has slashed pensions, axed state jobs, reduced welfare benefits, sold state assets and raised taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For Greece to get more loans, they are demanding reforms to make state administration and business rules more efficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The IMF has also requested: Scrapping multiple tax exemptions, removing obstacles to mass lay-offs for struggling businesses, restarting a major privatization program, and reforming a pension system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The creditors point to the fact that five years of such economic reforms have helped improve Greek public finances, even balancing the budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The economy emerged briefly from recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But to have any guarantee that Greece will be able to repay its rescue loans - which have ballooned national debt to 317 billion euros ($338 billion) by the end of 2014 - they want assurances that those extra reforms will be made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Greece is the least competitive economy in the eurozone and the 81st globally, according to the World Economic Forum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his Syriza party came to power in January with one main promise: end austerity measures previous Greek governments had agreed to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tsipras, 40, argues the measures and cuts must be redrawn to stimulate growth after having devastated the economy and caused a humanitarian crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The economy has shrunk by a quarter, leaving more than 25 percent of people without work, and even more without health insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In drawing up the latest reforms, Tsipras is focusing mainly on trying to reduce tax evasion by the rich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That will only get the government so much money, as much of its massive tax arrears comes from ordinary households and bankrupt businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tsipras' government has opposed other projects, such as further privatizations, and any talk of limiting job protection rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>His bargaining position could be limited by having a large far-left faction in his party and nationalist-right coalition partners who demand a tough position against creditors' demands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The new government's combative style has isolated Greece in the 19-member eurozone but is hugely popular at home, despite the financial risks involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A weekend opinion poll suggests the governing Syriza party has a near 25-point lead over rival conservatives, more than double the advantage it had in the Jan. 25 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"It has become well-nigh politically impossible for any Greek government to implement the reform policies being demanded by eurozone leaders," said Joan Hoey, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>If Greece is to avoid default, a compromise is needed, and Athens is under the most pressure to yield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Economists say the eurozone is better protected against the financial instability that could come from Greece leaving the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Sovereign downgrades and a surge in borrowing rates in recent week caused little market panic outside Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But for Greece, leaving the currency would cause huge economic turmoil, at least in the short term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In seeking a deal, the Greek government has agreed to some things it had previously ruled out, such as continued external oversight of the country's finances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But lenders are adamant Athens must accept more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He says Tsipras could compromise and accept some cost-savings reforms and in return for more modest budget targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Tsipras could sell it to the public, easily," said Palaiologos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"Convincing his own party might be more difficult."</td></tr>
