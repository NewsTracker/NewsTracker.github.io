<h3>Greece in talks with Russia to buy missiles for S-300 systems - RIA</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOSCOW, April 15 (Reuters) - Greece is negotiating with Russia for the purchase of missiles for its S-300 anti-missile systems and for their maintenance, Russia's RIA news agency quoted Greek Defence Minister Panos Kammenos as saying on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The report followed a visit by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras last week to Moscow, where he won pledges of Russian moral support and long-term cooperation but no fresh funds to help avert bankruptcy for his heavily indebted nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>NATO member Greece has been in possession of the Russian-made S-300 air defence systems since the late 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are limiting ourselves to replacement of missiles (for the systems)," RIA quoted Kammenos, who is in Moscow for a security conference, as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There are negotiations between Russia and Greece on the maintenance of the systems ... as well as for the purchase of new missiles for the S-300 systems," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Greek defence ministry in Athens later issued a statement quoting Kammenos as saying: "The existing defence cooperation programmes will continue. There will be maintenance for the existing programmes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was unclear where Greece, whose leftist government is struggling to secure the funds to meet its debt repayments, would find the money to buy more missiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin said after his talks with Tsipras in Moscow last week that Athens had not asked for money to ease its debt crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, Greece is keen to revive its traditionally good relations with Moscow, prompting unease among some of its European partners at a time of deep tension between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Monday, the Kremlin said Putin had signed a decree ending a self-imposed ban on delivering its S-300 anti-missile system to Tehran after world powers, including Russia, reached an interim deal with Iran on curbing its nuclear programme.</td></tr>
