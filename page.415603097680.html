<h3>Why WHO waited on Ebola: E-mails reveal politics behind slow response</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>By early June of last year, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa was the deadliest ever recorded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There weren't enough beds to treat patients and many were refusing to seek treatment, driving the outbreak underground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Senior staffers in Africa at the World Health Organization raised the prospect of declaring an international emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The answer from WHO's Geneva headquarters: Wait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to internal e-mails and documents obtained by Associated Press, the UN health agency resisted sounding the international alarm until August, a two-month delay that some argue may have cost lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>More than 10,000 are believed to have been killed by the virus since WHO announced the outbreak a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>WHO has acknowledged acting too slowly to control the Ebola epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In its defence, the agency says the virus's spread was unprecedented and blames several factors, including lack of resources and intelligence from the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Internal documents obtained by AP, however, show WHO's top leaders were informed of how dire the situation was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But they held off on declaring an emergency in part because it could have angered the countries involved, interfered with their mining interests or restricted the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Declaring an emergency was "a last resort," Dr. Sylvie Briand, who runs WHO's pandemic and epidemic diseases department, said in a June 5 e-mail to a colleague who floated the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It may be more efficient to use other diplomatic means for now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Five days after Briand's e-mail, WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan was sent a memo that warned cases might soon appear in Mali, Ivory Coast and Guinea Bissau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But it went on to say that declaring an international emergency or even convening a committee to discuss it "could be seen as a hostile act."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Critics and former WHO staff dismiss that reasoning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"That's like saying you don't want to call the fire department because you're afraid the trucks will create a disturbance," said Michael Osterholm, a prominent infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The signs this was no ordinary outbreak - the panic, the health workers' deaths, and the urban spread of the virus - were there from the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Many are recorded in a memo sent to WHO's Africa director on March 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In mid-April, an experienced Ebola expert with WHO's Africa office wrote to Geneva, with disturbing news that many staffers at a leading hospital in Guinea had been exposed to the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"What we see is the tip of an iceberg," Jean-Bosco Ndihokubwayo wrote in an e-mail, writing in all caps: "WE NEED SUPPORT."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Ebola outbreak erupted at a difficult time for the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>WHO was also struggling to contain polio outbreaks - which it had declared an international emergency in May - and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At a June 2 meeting, one senior scientist warned the agency was "overwhelmed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Declaring an international emergency might not necessarily have fixed all those problems - some argue it can create new ones - but it acts as a global distress signal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Dr. Joanne Liu, the international president of Doctors Without Borders, said she had been lobbying Chan to sound the alarm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I told her, 'Dr. Chan, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is out of control,' " Liu recalled telling Chan in a July 30 meeting in Geneva.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"And she looked at me and she said, 'Dr. Liu, I'm not that pessimistic.' And I just said, 'Dr. Chan, I'm not being pessimistic, I'm just being realistic.' " The emergency was eventually declared on Aug. 8, by which point nearly 1,000 people had already died from Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>WHO's Ebola response leader, Bruce Aylward, couldn't say whether an earlier declaration would have made a difference, noting that "the overall response slowed down" after the emergency was declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Had we declared it earlier, it is very, very difficult to say how perceptions would have affected the response."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Dr. Matthieu Kamwa, a former WHO scientist, describes that kind of reasoning as contradictory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>If emergencies don't work, why declare them at all?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The declaration triggered a global deployment to contain the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama ordered up to 3,000 troops to West Africa and promised to build more than a dozen 100-bed field hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Britain and France also pledged to build Ebola clinics; China sent a 59-person lab team and Cuba sent more than 400 health workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Kamwa says it's clear the alarm should have been sounded sooner.</td></tr>

<h3>Linda Goldston, former Mercury News reporter, pets columnist, dies at 67</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>She was 67.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The author of a popular pets column that attracted armies of enthusiastic readers, Goldston, a Tennessee native, worked at the San Jose newspaper for 38 years before retiring to Paso Robles in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She was long known for her determined and energetic pursuit of stories, whether she was probing for answers from an accused killer or inspiring readers to generously open their hearts to help the unfortunate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Linda Goldston was as good a reporter as I've ever known," said former Mercury News reporter and author Mike Weiss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"She was thorough and skeptical without being cynical, dogged without being pushy -- and brave."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Weiss noted Goldston's well-known brusque manner, but said it "protected a kind heart animated by the deep desire to see justice done and wrongdoing punished."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While Goldston penned many memorable pieces, her February 1999 series, "Zoo Animals To Go," was probably one of two that was most dear to her heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The four-part saga, detailed how "every year, animals once admired at dozens of the country's major zoos are sold or given away to dealers, contributing to a multi-billion-dollar-a-year exotic species marketplace," wrote Goldston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For the newspaper's Sunday West Magazine, Goldston and Weiss looked into the murky world of missing and murdered children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She was undaunted even by one of the creepiest characters she encountered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He was a very strange and potentially a very dangerous man who liked to visit the graves of murdered girls well past midnight," said Weiss of the suspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Linda was persuaded he was the murderer, yet to encourage him to open up to her, she accompanied him to a graveyard in the dead of night."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Linda Joy Goldston, born Feb. 12, 1948, never lost her gentle twang sculpted from growing up in Harriman, a tiny "temperance town" founded in 1889 in Tennessee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She attended the University of Tennessee for two years, but transferred to the famed School of Journalism at the University of Missouri, where she earned a degree in photojournalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>After working for a year as a photographer and staff writer at Today's News in Harriman, Goldston arrived at the Mercury News in June of 1974 as a temporary summer hire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The paper didn't let her go -- for nearly four decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Linda was a reporter's reporter," said Bert Robinson, Managing Editor/Content for the Bay Area News Group and a longtime colleague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"She had a fascination with unseemly characters, a deep affection for the downtrodden, and the skill to get both groups to tell their stories to her."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She was an avid smoker known to take outdoor cigarette breaks with mathematical precision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She loved her bevy of cats -- Bouncer, Maggie, Sara, Angelina, Jack and Jake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And she was a rabid fan of the Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team and Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In her 60s, Goldston happily landed a ticket to see Lady Gaga in a Bay Area concert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Goldston also loved to devour detective novels, especially paperbacks featuring the dark and difficult NYPD Sgt. Kathleen Mallory, created by her favorite author, Carol O'Connell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Meanwhile, in the newsroom, the diminutive, bespectacled Goldston was a dependable deadline writer with a disarming smile, blunt talk, a sweet tooth and the junk-food eating habits of a teenager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I always remember her walking through the newsroom with a Diet Coke and a laugh, wanting to talk with everyone about what they were working on," said Karen Casto, an assistant business editor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Linda took so much joy from her work. She thought it was a privilege and she treasured that every day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>About six years ago, Goldston started battling a rash of serious respiratory problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In November 2012, she quietly retired, eschewing the customary newsroom going-away hoopla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Soon she moved to the Paso Robles home of her long time companion, Teresa Allen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Linda was doing well until about a month ago," said Allen, who teaches journalism at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"She indulged her passions by reading a book a day, working on her memoir and reading the 20 magazines she subscribed to -- from The Nation to People."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But due to a grave lung infection, Goldston entered hospice about three weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Before that, she was driving her car and, of course, smoking," said Allen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"She was a quiet curmudgeon but she so loved the Mercury and being a reporter, I think she would have wanted to die in the newsroom."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Goldston is survived by Allen and by two sisters -- Betty and Jane -- who still live in Harriman.</td></tr>
