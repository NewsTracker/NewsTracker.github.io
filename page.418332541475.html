<h3>Dick Durbin letter to Ukraine PM may be Russian forgery</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON- A letter to Ukraine's prime minister that is supposedly written by a U.S. senator appears to be a Russian forgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a top member of the Senate Democratic leadership, said Monday the June 25 letter in his name to Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk is a fake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The missive is a ham-handed attempt to suggest Durbin, a vocal critic of Russia, secretly controls Yatsenyuk's personnel decisions - an allegation that bolsters Russian efforts to depict the Kiev regime as a U.S. puppet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Senator Durbin has been outspoken in his criticism of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and supportive of Ukrainian efforts to reform their economy and defend their nation," Durbin spokesman Ben Marter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This letter is a forgery and was obviously written by somebody with a tenuous grasp of the English language. We've referred the matter to the FBI and CIA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The letter, on realistic-looking letterhead, uses stilted language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It is necessary to invest every effort to keep Olseksiy Pavlenko in his office of Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food," the letter says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"His discharge will create additional obstacles on the way of widening cooperation between the U.S. and Ukrainian agricultural companies."</td></tr>
