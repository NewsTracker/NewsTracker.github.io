<h3>Greek government seen calling confidence vote</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - A Greek minister indicates it is highly likely Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will call for a vote of confidence in his government after a bailout deal with foreign creditors sparked a rebellion within his governing Syriza party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Energy and Environment Minister Panos Skourletis told private Skai television Monday that he feels the move is "self-evident" following last week's parliamentary vote on the bailout, which passed thanks to opposition parties' support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dozens of Syriza lawmakers dissented and voted against the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Skourletis said he believes early elections are also necessary.</td></tr>
