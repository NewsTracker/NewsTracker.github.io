<tr><td>4</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Facebook wants you to see more of what you want to see.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>You'll now be able to choose the friends and pages you want to see on your news feed first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>To do this, go to the friend's profile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Click on the box that says "following" and select "see first."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Facebook's computer software uses a wide range of information you provide to decide what to show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This includes what friends you interact with and how often, or whether you tend to like photos, videos or text updates more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In announcing the new tools Thursday, Facebook acknowledged that its automated system isn't perfect, so it wants to give users a way to set their own preferences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In addition to selecting who or what page you will see first, you'll still to be able to "unfollow" friends so you won't see them at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This option has been available before to people who don't want to take drastic step of unfriending someone but would rather not read about their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For the rest, though, Facebook will continue to use its software to choose what to show you.</td></tr>
