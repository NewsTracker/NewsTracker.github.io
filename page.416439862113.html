<h3>Google Becomes a Mobile Carrier With Project Fi</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google is introducing a new wireless titled "Project Fi."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google is officially joining the world of mobile carriers with an easy-to-use wireless network that offers fast connections at a cheaper price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The search giant today announced the highly anticipated Project Fi mobile network, taking an unorthodox approach to mobile coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Building Project Fi on top of Sprint and T-Mobile's networks, Google said subscribers will be able to pass between both networks, depending on which has the strongest signal in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Subscribers will also be connected to open Wi-Fi hotspots that Google has determined are fast and secure -- allowing users to get faster service and to use less data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With Project Fi, a subscriber's phone number would live in the cloud, allowing them to make calls from multiple screens -- something that could be useful when dealing with a misplace phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Project Fi has the potential to be a game changer for the U.S. market," Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told ABC News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It aligns closer to the way consumers want to buy and use their services versus what many carriers are offering currently."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The network is by invite-only and is currently limited to Nexus 6 users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The payment structure is also something different for the wireless industry, allowing subscribers to pay $20 for unlimited talk and text, and an additional $10 per GB of data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Don't use it all?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Google will refund you what you paid for your unused plan at the end of the month.</td></tr>
