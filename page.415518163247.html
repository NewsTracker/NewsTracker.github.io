<h3>Robert Durst charged with murder, movie confession likely admissible</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Durst, the subject of a six-part HBO documentary series called "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst," was picked up by a filmmaker's microphone apparently acknowledging his crimes and admitting that he was "caught."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was formally charged on Monday in the first-degree murder of a longtime friend, writer Susan Berman, in a 15-year-old cold case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Also on Monday, Durst agreed to be extradited to Los Angeles County from New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He could face the death penalty in the case, which was filed by Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey with special circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He is accused of murdering Berman two days before Christmas in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Long estranged from his powerful family with its major New York real estate holdings, the eccentric Durst has been tried and acquitted in the death of another person in Texas and was a suspect in the disappearance of his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Considered a flight risk, he was arrested on Saturday at a New Orleans hotel on a warrant from Los Angeles County, according to a police report, which noted that he was in possession of a revolver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was taken into custody the day before his chilling statement aired during the final minutes of the HBO series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Whether Durst's apparent confession will be admissible at trial would likely be the subject of a pre-trial hearing that would "certainly be the centerpiece of the legal battle," said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor now at the McCarter & English law firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It turns on whether or not there was an expectation of privacy," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Paul Callan, a former New York City homicide prosecutor, believes the statement will be admitted as evidence because Durst could not have had an expectation of privacy in a public restroom when he was wearing a microphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Matthew Galluzzo, a defense lawyer and former prosecutor in New York, said the recording is "probably admissible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The only way Durst's lawyers could challenge it, Galluzzo said, aside from showing that the recording has been tampered with, is to assert that the HBO filmmakers were acting as agents of law enforcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Series director Andrew Jarecki, speaking on Good Morning America on Monday, said he was unaware of the apparent confession for more than two years after it was recorded, and that his team reached out to law enforcement after an editor discovered it during a review of the tape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We've been in contact with law enforcement for the past two years," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"And so, when we finally found that subsequent admission, what happens in the bathroom, we contacted them and we said we have something more."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Durst, 71, maintained his innocence after the possible confession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We're ready to go to California and to have a trial," defense attorney Dick DeGuerin said after Durst appeared in a New Orleans court in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Los Angeles Police Department said the timing of Durst's arrest had nothing to do with the finale of the documentary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Officer Rosario Herrera said on Monday she could not comment on whether detectives were aware of the finale and its contents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The arrest was made through evidence," she told Reuters, declining to say what that evidence revealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The warrant, issued on Wednesday by Los Angeles County, is for the death of Susan Berman, whose body was discovered in her West Los Angeles home on Christmas Eve in 2000, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Durst was booked on Monday in a New Orleans jail on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm and possessing a firearm with a controlled substance, according to court records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A state police official told the Times-Picayune newspaper that the substance was marijuana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Berman, a friend from graduate school, served as Durst's spokeswoman after his first wife disappeared, according to the New York Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Durst was questioned but not charged in the death of Kathleen Durst in 1982, and he was acquitted of murder in a third case in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In the final installment of the HBO series, Durst was talking to himself when he appeared to say he carried out all three killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The documentary showed an interview session during which he rejected a piece of evidence against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Durst then went to the bathroom, still wearing the microphone, when he whispered, "There it is, you're caught... What a disaster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He added: "What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Durst's transfer to California is being held up as local prosecutors in New Orleans weigh bringing unspecified charges against him, his attorney said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>"There's little kids with really bad cuts and stuff from the cyclone that can't even get a bandage at the moment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said concerned expats and local businesses had taken it upon themselves to buy bags of rice, flour and other supplies and distribute them to hungry locals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A New Zealand woman, also a long-term resident, said the NDMO had handed out lengthy disaster surveys to hungry people who didn't even know how to fill them out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Some of the questions aren't even related to the cyclone. They're just ridiculous," she told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said people desperately needed food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"In Vanuatu we get earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, cyclones. We're used to disasters. We know how to get things going again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"This time we have all this help, but seven days later we still don't have the one thing we need - food."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Vanuatu has hit out at the lack of coordination among aid groups swarming the cyclone-ravaged Pacific nation, which it says is costing precious time getting help to those in need, while warning food will run out in a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Relief agencies have been battling logistical challenges in the sprawling archipelago with a lack of landing strips and deep water ports hampering their efforts to reach distant islands and get a better grip on the full scale of the disaster.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>National disaster committee deputy chair Benjamin Shing said while the country appreciates the aid, the initial response could have been handled better with many groups and NGOs working on their own rather than in cooperation with the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I do apologise but I have to state the facts. We have seen this time and time again," he said at a briefing in the capital Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"In nearly every country in the world where they go in they have their own operational systems, they have their own networks and they refuse to conform to government directives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We had to spend the first three days trying to get some form of coordination in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A woman looks on amongst the ruins of her home on the remote south-west coast of Tanna Island , Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>That was much precious time that could have been spent doing the assessments instead." Oxfam country director in Port Vila Colin Collett van Rooyen denied any disorganisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Our position is that we will continue to work with the government, as we have been, and as we always do, to address the best interests of those in need," he said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>38</td><td>Staff at the capital's main school are desperately trying to salvage resources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"There are lots of book warehouses out there, you know in the western world books are going out of fashion, you can't sell your second-hand books, you can't get rid of them. Well, we need good books, good encyclopedias, reference books, all subjects, reading books." said Port Vila Central School headmaster Paul Alexander Hetyey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Australia's Medical Assistance Team is now set up at the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"This is still an unfolding story," AusMAT's Matthew Harper told SBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"We're seeing a fairly low casualty rate, we seeing trauma usually associated with cyclones, so blunt object injuries and broken bones."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Almost a week after the cyclone, relief missions are just now beginning to reach Vanuatu's devastated outer Islands.</td></tr>

<tr><td>51</td><td>The southern islands of Tanna and Erromango bore the full brunt of the category five cyclone when she barreled over the island group on Friday March 13, causing widespread devastation and destroying entire villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>In recent days, the UN revised the death toll from the cyclone down to 11 from 24, but it's tipped to rise once rescuers make contact with outlying areas which have lost communications links.</td></tr>

<tr><td>58</td><td>Those displaced include families, elderly people and even a baby, Angelina Watskall, who was born more than a week ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Tanna authorities have been attempting to direct aid without computers, the internet, other communications or power, with all plans and procedures written on large sheets of paper stuck to walls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Locals are being urging people to boil water before drinking it and are being warned of the dangers of eating rotten fruit, as desperation grows among those impacted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Authorities on the island are also concerned about the risk of disease as Tanna has no working medical facilities and medicine is scarce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>The disaster has prompted aid workers across Vanuatu to launch an emergency measles vaccination drive for children as the country has low rates of immunisation and already suffered one outbreak of the disease earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Meanwhile, remote parts of Tafea province, like the islands of Futuna and Aniwa, are still to make contact with anyone, raising fears about how communities there coped with the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>The southern side of Tanna is also a black spot, with no assessment teams yet to reach the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Many UN and aid group officials arrived on Wednesday morning to help, but say it's almost impossible to direct aid before a full assessment is made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Some aid packages and Australian Defence Force personnel arrived at Tanna airport on Wednesday and Thursday.</td></tr>
