<h3>FIFA suspends 2026 World Cup bidding amid corruption scandal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA has suspended the bidding process for the 2026 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The football organization is weathering the storm of a widening corruption scandal that touches on previous selections of host countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Due to the situation, I think it's nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being. It will be postponed," FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke told a news conference in the southern Russian city of Samara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Potential bidders for 2026 include the US, Mexico, Canada and several European countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Valcke said the process would not be started anew, it was merely suspended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The host for the tornament is expected to be chosen by the 209 FIFA members in May 2017 at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Details of the new timetable and rules will be sent to member states soon, Valcke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Samara is one of the World Cup 2018 host venues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Valcke was visiting the city to see how preparations for the finals are going.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>FIFA has been mired by a scandal over alleged bribe taking and other forms of corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Valcke himself is connected to this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Earlier, the BBC published documents allegedly incriminating former FIFA Vice-President Jack Warner of misappropriating $10 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Warner is among the football executives who were arrested in Zurich in May. US prosecutors alleged the money was paid as a bribe by South Africa to promote its 2010 World Cup bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Valcke, who signed the transfer documents shown by the British broadcaster, said he has nothing to answer for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If you think I am the next person after [ex FIFA President Sepp] Blatter, I say there is nothing to blame me for," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Don't blame us for the fact that the transfer happened. Yes, my [signature] was on it. The question is why nobody asked about it at the time. Why should FIFA be responsible for that misappropriation case? That was not FIFA money."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Blatter was re-elected FIFA president on May 29 amid the unfolding scandal, only to resign his position several days later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He retains the position of acting president until a new election is conducted at an extraordinary FIFA Congress.</td></tr>
