<h3>Boehner calls on Hillary Clinton to turn over email server to 'neutral third party'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He also took a jab at Clinton for failing to sign a "separation statement," a recommended step for departing State Department staff that acknowledges they have handed over all their appropriate records to the proper officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It wasn't until after the Select Committee on Benghazi demanded the records that the State Department asked Clinton to turn over her emails," Boehner said in a statement on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"That's a big problem if she signed that form like she was supposed to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday that the department "did not have any record" of Clinton signing a separation statement and that her failure to do so is "not a violation of any rule."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are fairly certain that she didn't [sign the form] or we would have record of it," Psaki said, but added recent secretaries of state hadn't signed the form either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We did not locate any record of either of her immediate predecessors signing this form," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The speaker's office has called on Clinton to provide her server to a third-party investigator, but Tuesday's remarks were the first public comments from Boehner since Clinton explained she kept personal emails on a separate server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think this is the fairest way to make sure we have all the documents that belong to the public, and ultimately, all the facts," Boehner said after meeting with House Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Boehner sidestepped a question on whether House committees would issue a subpoena for the email server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The speaker said he expected "rigorous oversight" from two House panels -- the Select Committee on Benghazi, headed by South Carolina GOP Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Trey Gowdy, and the House Oversight Committee, chaired by Utah Republican Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jason Chaffetz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He credited the select committee with exposing Clinton's use of personal email instead of a government email account when she served as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gowdy has already issued a subpoena for emails related to the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya that killed the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Monday he agreed to an extension that Clinton requested to produce the documents by March 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The speaker pushed back at Democrats' complaints that multiple congressional probes were "overkill" and Clinton was receiving extra scrutiny because she was likely to announce she was running for president in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Nothing has changed," Boehner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The Benghazi committee is focused on getting the facts about what happened with regard to Benghazi. Government Reform Committee is worked on the federal open records law, and they're continuing their work on that. There is nothing, no changes been made in terms of how we're approaching dealing with these documents."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who testified before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday, was grilled about Clinton's use of a personal email account during her tenure as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lew, who was a senior official at the State Department under Clinton, said he "didn't pay a lot of attention to what email she was using" and that he has no recollection of discussing the issue of email usage with the former secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Pressed by Republican Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Scott Garrett of New Jersey if he never noticed that Clinton was using personal email, Lew responded: "I'm telling you that at the time, I was mostly paying attention to the substance of what I was communicating."</td></tr>

<h3>GOP offers $3.8T budget that boosts defense spending, cuts elsewhere and balances in 10 years.</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - House Republicans launched a boldly conservative 10-year budget plan on Tuesday that would favor the Pentagon, partially privatize Medicare and rely on deep cuts in other social programs to help wipe out deficits at the end of a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A little more than four months after winning their largest majority in 70 years, Republicans promised an overhaul of the federal tax code and called for repeal of two of the top legislative achievements of President Barack Obama's tenure in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Those are the health care law known by his name and a measure enacted to crack down on Wall Street after the economy's near-collapse in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Republicans said their balanced-budget promise came with no tax increases, though the fine print assumes the expiration of about $900 billion in breaks for business research and development and other items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The new normal of slow economic growth and low expectations is unacceptable. We know we can do better," the House Budget Committee, chaired by Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tom Price of Georgia, said in a report accompanying the proposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It promised "greater prosperity, opportunity, security and freedom" if enacted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Projected spending for the budget year that begins on Oct. 1 was $3.8 trillion, rising to $5 trillion in 2025.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Obama countered Republican claims instantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said the GOP prescription "is a failure to invest in education, infrastructure and national defense - all the things we need to grow, to create jobs, to stay at the forefront of innovation and to keep our country safe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The president's own budget calls for about $2 trillion over 10 years in higher taxes on corporations, wealthy individuals and smokers of all income levels as part of a plan to increase spending and give tax breaks to the middle class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Rhetoric aside, the release of the tax and spending plan in the House begins a rite of spring as reliable as the appearance of daffodil shoots on the Capitol grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Senate Republicans intend to outline their own plan on Wednesday, and each house is expected to ratify its own version next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After that comes the harder challenge of forging a compromise between the two versions, a task that Republicans acknowledge will mark a test of their ability to govern now that they control both houses of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>An even more difficult challenge follows, the translation of policy objectives into legislation that would be sent to Obama to sign or - more likely - veto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The budget also is certain to become an issue in the still-early race for the White House in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The House budget relies heavily in some areas on previous plans put together by Price's predecessor as committee chairman, Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It also adapts to changing political circumstances, most notably by offsetting a looming automatic budget cut in national security accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The proposal would allow spending in the coming budget year of $36 billion more than Obama recommended for overseas military and diplomatic efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Less than half of the $36 billion would be guaranteed, and the rest would depend on offsetting spending cuts elsewhere in the budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some Republicans and outside groups bristled at the prospect of so large an increase, tucked into the budget in an account for overseas operations that is not subject to spending caps designed to hold down deficits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I'm tired of seeing gimmicks in the budget process," said Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Justin Amash of Michigan, a conservative and frequent critic of his party's leadership.</td></tr>
