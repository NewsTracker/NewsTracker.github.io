<h3>Deaf immigrant jailed 6 weeks with no access to interpreter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Eventually, Abreham Zemedagegehu learned that he'd been accused of stealing an iPad - an iPad whose owner later found it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He spent the next six weeks in jail, unable to communicate with his jailers because he is deaf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He described a frightening, isolated experience in which medical procedures were performed without his consent and he feared for his safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Zemedagegehu sued the Arlington County sheriff last month in federal court, saying his treatment failed to meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I felt like I was losing my mind," Zemedagegehu said through an interpreter in an interview at his lawyer's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I thought Virginia would give me an interpreter and they said no. That's why I felt lost."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Zemedagegehu, who is homeless, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Ethiopia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He grew up using Ethiopian Sign Language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He has learned American Sign Language, but he has never learned more than rudimentary written English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Maj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Susie Doyel, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office, which runs the jail, declined to comment on the specific allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She generally defended the jail's ability to handle deaf inmates and others with disabilities, and said several deputies in the jail are proficient in sign language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But she also acknowledged that communication with a deaf inmate is more problematic in cases where the inmate can't communicate in written English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In court papers filed Monday, lawyers for the sheriff ask a judge to dismiss the case, arguing that even if Zemedagegehu's allegations are true, they fail to show intentional discrimination because they attempted various different ways to communicate with him, including handwritten notes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And even if the discrimination were intentional, the lawyers write that it would not violate federal law because there is a rational basis for the discrimination: "it takes extra resources and creates additional security considerations to bring in an ASL interpreter," they write.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Zemedagegehu's ordeal began Feb. 2, 2014, as he sought a warm place to sleep at Reagan National Airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>According to Zemedagegehu's lawsuit, officers from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority arrested him on a complaint that he had stolen another man's iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Zemedagegehu says he requested an ASL interpreter to explain what was happening, but instead was taken to the Arlington jail for processing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said the booking process was bewildering, with someone speaking on a video screen and he not understanding what was happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After he was booked, he underwent a medical screening, and says he was given forms to sign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He didn't know what they were, and refused to sign them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He says they stuck a needle in his arm without explaining what was occurring - he later learned it was tuberculosis test, to which he suffered a bad reaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It was not until he was arraigned Feb. 4, and a court interpreter was present, that he understood the charge against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>When he was offered an opportunity to communicate, he said the jail provided a TTY device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Zemedagegehu said the machine was useless - it types out English text he doesn't understand, and as a practical matter, he said, no one in the deaf community still uses a TTY device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He needed instead access to a videophone or video relay service that is more commonly used, he said.</td></tr>
