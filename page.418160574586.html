<h3>Tsipras defiant as banks shut, markets rocked</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Anxious pensioners swarmed closed bank branches Monday and long lines snaked outside ATMs as Greeks endured the first day of serious controls on their daily economic lives ahead of a referendum that could determine whether the country has to ditch the euro currency and return to the drachma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was defiant, urging voters to reject creditors' demands, insisting a "No" vote in next Sunday's referendum would strengthen Athens' negotiating hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We ask you to reject it with all the might of your soul, with the greatest margin possible," he said on state television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The greater the participation and the rejection of this deal, the greater the possibility will be to restart the negotiations to set a course of logic and sustainability."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece's bailout program ends Tuesday, when the country is unlikely to make a 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) repayment to the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Athens and creditors from the IMF and the eurozone failed to agree on the terms of an extension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tsipras called the referendum over the weekend, arguing that demands for tougher austerity measures could not be accepted after six years of recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The move shook world markets, saw Greek borrowing rates skyrocket, and set off a credit downgrade further into junk status from Standard & Poor's rating agency, which said it now sees a 50-percent chance of Greece leaving the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>By Tuesday in Asia, stock markets were recouping some of the previous day's losses but remained jittery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That has stoked fears of a crippling bank run, a messy Greek debt default and an exit from the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As the clock ran out on a Greece deal, Greeks were handed a daily 60 euros ($67) cash withdrawal limit, sending crowds of elderly depositors who do not have ATM cards rushing to closed bank branches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I came here at 4 a.m. because I have to get my pension," said 74-year-old Anastasios Gevelidis, one of about 100 retirees waiting outside the main branch of the National Bank of Greece in the country's second-largest city of Thessaloniki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The sight of an economy on the precipice hit global markets hard Monday, driving stocks down in the United States and across Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>U.S. stocks had their worst day of the year, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 350 points to 17,596, while The Standard & Poor's 500 index sank 43 points to 2,057.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The losses wiped out all the gains for the Dow and S&P 500 indexes this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In Europe, the Stoxx 50 index of leading shares ended 2.5 percent lower, while Germany's DAX slid 3.6 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There were also some early warning signs that Greece's problems may prove contagious - the borrowing rates of other highly indebted eurozone countries such as Italy and Portugal inched up slightly.</td></tr>
