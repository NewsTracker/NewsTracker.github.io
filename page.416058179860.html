<h3>Egypt photojournalist describes detention of over 600 days</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mahmoud Abou-Zeid, known by his nickname Shawkan, was arrested in August 2013 while taking photographs of the government's violent dispersal of a sit-in by supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Over 600 people were killed in the dispersal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Shawkan's older brother, Mohammed, said Tuesday the letter was sent last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He described his brother as a broken man who has no access to books, only eating and sleeping in a small cell that houses 12 other prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He is silent for most of the visits," said Mohammed, who alternates with family members to visit Shawkan every week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Asked why his brother is still detained without charges, Mohammed said: "I too would like to know the answer to this question."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Thousands of Morsi supporters have been rounded up since, many facing trial on violence-related charges amid a wider crackdown on dissent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Egypt was rated among the 10 worst jailers of journalists in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Committee to Protect Journalists said in December that at least 12 journalists, including three Al-Jazeera journalists are detained in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Australian Al-Jazeera journalist Peter Greste has since been released, but the trial of his colleagues continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 27-year old Shawkan was rounded up outside the mosque where the sit-in was held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He was interrogated on suspicion of rioting, taking part in the violent protest and belonging to an Islamist group that authorities have since declared a terrorist organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Shawkan said the accusations were "fabricated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Shawkan said he was only taking pictures of the dispersal, describing a scene that felt like a "war" with flying bullets and tear gas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It was like a Hollywood movie," he said in a letter published by Amnesty International Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Shawkan said despite identifying himself to authorities as a journalist, they still detained him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two foreign journalists arrested with him were released two hours later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Shawkan said he was beaten by five officers at the same time, denied food and water for three days, and denied treatment for his injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the letter, Shawkan describes how heard the screams of dozens of other prisoners choking and suffocating in a notorious incident when police fired tear gas into a prison van packed with detainees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Shawkan was crammed in another prison van, one of several such vehicles parked outside a prison court in the sweltering summer sun for seven hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Many of us were lost, powerless to help. We laid down, unable to take a breath. I felt like I was dying as I listened to the prisoners around me praying and gasping for air," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some 37 detainees died in the tear gas incident, and four police officers are standing trial for manslaughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Shawkan was then transferred to another prison four months later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Tora Prison is like a cemetery," he wrote, describing how he shares a 9x12 foot cell with 12 others, sleeping on the floor and sharing a tiny kitchen with a single electric hot plate they often use for heating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A squat-down drop toilet, "basically a hole in the concrete floor," is separated from the cooking area by only a blanket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Our dignity was left at the prison gates," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I am a photojournalist, not a criminal. My indefinite detention is psychologically unbearable. Not even animals would survive in these conditions."</td></tr>
