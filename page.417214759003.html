<h3>Naughty Boy: No bad blood between Zayn Malik and One Direction, despite Twitter war</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Zayn Malik's producer pal Naughty Boy insists there's no bad blood between the singer and his former One Direction bandmates, despite a recent Twitter war of words between the ex-boy band star and Louis Tomlinson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Malik quit the band in March, explaining he wanted to be a "normal 22 year old", and has since started work on a solo project with Naughty Boy, who leaked some of their early music last month and prompted the spat between the former bandmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The feud led to Malik taking aim at Tomlinson in one tweet, which read: "Louis--Tomlinson remember when you had a life and stopped making b**chy comments about mine?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tomlinson recently addressed the war of words during an appearance on comedian James Corden's U.S. late-night TV show, and insisted the matter has been resolved, adding, "There's been a bit of back and forth. I think we're on good terms again... I've never been very good at biting my tongue... Twitter's great for connecting with the fans but also if you feel like saying something you probably shouldn't, it's also good for that as well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And now Naughty Boy has echoed his remarks, telling BANG Showbiz, "I don't think there's any real bad blood, especially from this side. I just want people to support him (Malik) and prepare for his future. I think people just need to respect his reasons for leaving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Right now it's down time for Zayn but I think there is a journey for him..."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And the producer admits his pal is struggling to keep his silence, adding, "He's in a very difficult position. He won't tell his side of the story yet and that's why there has to be radio silence... I do feel a bit sorry for the fans because they've been brought up with this."</td></tr>
