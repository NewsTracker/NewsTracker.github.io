<h3>Could it be that Islamic State is transforming into a functioning state?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Could it be that Islamic State is transforming into a functioning state?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Islamic State propaganda site shows a boy waiting with other youths to join training camps in Deir al-Zor, in eastern Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Istanbul: The Islamic State uses terror to force obedience and frighten enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It has seized territory, destroyed antiquities, slaughtered minorities, forced women into sexual slavery and turned children into killers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But its officials are apparently resistant to bribes, and in that way, at least, it has outdone the corrupt Syrian and Iraqi governments it routed, residents and experts say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You can travel from Raqqa to Mosul and no one will dare to stop you even if you carry $1 million," said Bilal, who lives in Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital in Syria, and out of fear insisted on being identified only by his first name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A shot from an IS propaganda website shows a street preaching event at Tel Abyad town in Raqqa province, north-east Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Increasingly, as IS consolidates its hold on territory, the group is transforming into a functioning state that uses extreme violence as a tool while filling a vacuum left by governments that also employed violence - arrest, torture and detention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yet the group is also issuing identification cards for residents, promulgating fishing guidelines to preserve stocks and requiring that cars carry tool kits for emergencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That transition may demand that the West rethink its approach to combating the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A photo from an Islamic State propaganda website shows distribution of sweets, soft drinks, and religious texts in Tel Abyad, north-east Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I think that there is no question that the way to look at it is as a revolutionary state-building organisation," said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a recent essay in Foreign Policy magazine, Professor Walt argued that after almost a year of US-led air strikes on the group, it is becoming clear that "only a large-scale foreign intervention is likely to roll back and ultimately eliminate the Islamic State".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>David Richards, a former British military chief of staff, has said "tanks would have to roll and there's going to have to be boots on the ground", describing the current approach as "dribbling, not clouting".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But there is now also a widespread belief that a military strategy alone, without political reconciliation to offer alienated Sunnis an alternative authority, is not sufficient to defeat IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An Islamic State propaganda website shows youth units known as the "lion cubs" holding rifles during a parade after graduating from a religious school in Tel Afar, near Mosul, northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This is mostly because many Sunnis in both countries who live under the group see no viable alternative, especially not in a return to rule by the governments of Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Honestly, both are dirty, the regime and [IS]," said Ahmed, the owner of an antiques shop who recently fled to Raqqa to avoid air strikes in outlying areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But IS, he said, "is more acceptable here in Raqqa".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ahmed, who gave only his first name for fear of reprisals, has also lived under the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the rebel group that rose up in 2011 to fight the Syrian government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The FSA, he said, is "like the regime. They are thieves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>An Islamic State militant distributes bags full of stationery to Iraqi school pupils in Mosul, northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Under IS, he said, life can be brutal, but at least it seems more stable for those who can avoid crossing the group's leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Here they are implementing God's regulations," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The killer is killed. The adulterer is stoned. The thief's hands are cut."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A similar sentiment helped the Taliban consolidate power two decades ago in Afghanistan: While the Taliban were feared, and their justice was often brutal, they were also respected by many Afghans for standing against corruption and chaos - and they remained firmly in control until the US invasion in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Drawing on parallels from history, experts say, the group's violence can be seen in a different light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Professor Walt mentioned the atrocities of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the Communist one in China - imperfect analogies, to be sure, but ones that underscored the violence and oppression that can precede creation of a revolutionary state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"At the time, these movements were regarded as completely beyond the pale and a threat to international order," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>John McLaughlin, who was deputy director of the CIA from 2000 to 2004, pointed to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organisation seen as a terrorist group in the eyes of the West and now a legitimate political player, and also reached back centuries to the brutality of English royalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"If you look at what the English kings did to consolidate their territories in the 14th and 15th centuries," he said, "they were not only beheading people but disembowelling them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>William McCants, the director of the Project on US Relations With the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution in Washington, and an expert on the evolution of IS, said the historical analogies were accurate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"We in the West have bought into this idea that insurgency and counterinsurgency is a battle for hearts and minds," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"We forget how many states have been established through brutality."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Inside Islamic State territory, the group's violence is regarded differently than it is in the West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In the communities it controls, citizens have already grown inured to violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In Iraq, citizens have lived with war for more than a decade, including the days of sectarian civil war when a signature act of some Shiite militias was to drill the heads of Sunnis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>And before that, they lived under the police state thuggery and corruption of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Now there is a limited sense of order, and cleaner streets, a low bar, perhaps, but a reality amid years of war and anarchy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Hassan Hassan, an analyst who has studied IS and is a co-author of a book on the group, said that if people avoid any sign of dissent, he said, they can largely go about their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Not happily," he said, "but they can live at peace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>He added: "They feel like there is a functioning state."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Three Australian men arrested over alleged nightclub rape in Split, Croatia: reports Donald Trump's talent for making enemies Five people arrested over Uniqlo sex video, Chinese authorities say Could it be that Islamic State is transforming into a functioning state?</td></tr>
