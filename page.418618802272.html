<h3>Sport24.co.za | Tributes pour in for Jules Bianchi</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nice - Tributes poured in from the world of Formula One for French driver Jules Bianchi, who died in the early hours of Saturday morning after a long fight against horrendous injuries sustained in a head-on crash during the Japanese Grand Prix last October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 25-year-old Bianchi died in a hospital in his home town of Nice, 30 kilometres from the track where he sealed the best performance of his young career: the Monaco Grand Prix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was on Monaco's tight and sinewy circuit last year that Bianchi, driving for Marussia - now known as Manor Marussia - finished in ninth place and gave the unheralded team its best finish and first points in F1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Words cannot describe the enormous sadness within our team this morning, as we come to terms with losing Jules," said John Booth, team principal of the Manor Marussia team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He has left an indelible mark on all our lives, and will forever be part of everything we have achieved, and everything we will strive for going forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bianchi's drive that day was a mixture of flair, steely determination, and panache: exactly the traits that were spotted in him early on, when he was touted as a future star of the sport after graduating from the Ferrari academy in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He then competed in 34 Grand Prix races.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Jules was a shining talent. He was destined for great things in our sport: success he so richly deserved," Booth said in a statement released by the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"He was also a magnificent human being, making a lasting impression on countless people all over the world ... he was an extremely warm, humble and intensely likeable person who lit up our garage and our lives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Bianchi was a much-liked driver in the sometimes edgy and brittle F1 championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Countryman Romain Grosjean, a rival driver on the Lotus team, expressed that reality in this tweet: "Yesterday we lost one of the best guys and best drivers I've ever met. I'll miss you so much my friend."</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>"He only had that (racing) in mind," his father Philippe said in an interview with Var-Matin newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We looked after a track in Antibes and he would spend his time watching the customers going around the tarmac. As soon as his feet touched the pedals, he wanted to climb into a kart."</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>"He fought right until the end. We thought a miracle could happen," Alesi told RMC radio.</td></tr>
