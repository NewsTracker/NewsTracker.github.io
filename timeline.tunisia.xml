    <title>&lt;p&gt;Tunisia has been struggling to keep extremist violence at bay since the overthrow of its dictator in 2011, and the attack was the worst on a tourist site since an al Qaida car bomb killed 21 people - mostly Germans - in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;The Bardo, built in a 15th century palace, is the largest museum in Tunisia and houses one of the world's largest collections of Roman mosaics among its 8,000 works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, violence in Tunisia in recent years has been largely focused on security forces, not foreigners or tourist sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack came the day after Tunisian security officials confirmed the death in neighbouring Libya of Ahmed Rouissi, leading suspect in Tunisian terror attacks and in the killings of two opposition figures in Tunisia.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;Rouissi was a top member of Tunisia's Ansar al-Sharia extremist group branded as terrorists by Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tunisians make up one of the largest contingents of foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq, but more recently militants have been sending jihadis to take part in the conflict in Tunisia's North African neighbor Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tunisia also said on Tuesday it had dismantled a recruiting cell sending jihadis to fight in Libya and arrested dozens in part of tighter security and border controls to counter Islamist militants.&lt;/p&gt;</title>
