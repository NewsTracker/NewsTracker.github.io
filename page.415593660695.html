<h3>Secrecy preserved in police chokehold death probe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Garnett has refused to release secret testimony heard by a grand jury that declined to indict a police officer in the chokehold death of Garner, saying the parties who brought the suit didn't make a good enough argument for releasing the minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - A push for answers on how a New York City police officer avoided criminal charges in the videotaped chokehold death of Eric Garner has run aground after failing to clear the strict legal bar protecting grand jury secrecy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>State Supreme Court Justice William Garnett ruled on Thursday that the grand jury record would remain under seal, rejecting arguments by the New York Civil Liberties Union and others that the public had a right to know why jurors refused to indict the officer in spite of the video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He wrote that the law required the plaintiffs to establish a "compelling and particularized need" to release the grand jury minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Staten Island judge's ruling cited a handful of rare instances where New York courts authorized disclosure, but only to specific parties for specific reasons - not out of the public interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For example, a 2012 appeals court ruling authorized release of bank records from a grand jury proceeding to someone seeking a civil judgment against the United Arab Emirates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Another ruling in 1978 turned over witness statements to state police for disciplinary proceedings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A 2001 decision even gave the son of a defendant in a decades-old murder case access to grand jury minutes to use for a movie script.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At a hearing in February, Garnett had asked over and over how the Garner grand jury minutes would be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The only answer which the court heard was the possibility of effecting legislative change," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"That proffered need is purely speculative and does not satisfy the requirements of the law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The effort to make the Garner grand jury record public had been considered a longshot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the decision comes amid an ongoing debate over whether the laws need revisions promoting more transparency, particularly when it involves police shootings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>By preserving secrecy in the Garner case, the court "has reinforced the distrust many New Yorkers already feel toward the performance of the criminal justice system in this case," said NYCLU legal director Arthur Eisenberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Officer Daniel Pantaleo and other officers had stopped Garner last summer on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A video shot by an onlooker shows Garner telling the officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Pantaleo responded by wrapping his arm around Garner's neck in what he said was a sanctioned takedown move and not a banned chokehold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The heavyset Garner, who had asthma, is heard on the tape gasping, "I can't breathe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He loses consciousness and died at a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The NYCLU and others had asked the court to order Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan to release the grand jury transcript, including the testimony of Pantaleo, and dozens of witnesses, detailed descriptions of evidence and other documentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A similar step was voluntarily taken by the prosecutor in Ferguson, Missouri, when a grand jury there refused to indict an officer in the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Both Garner and Brown were black; the officers involved are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The deaths sparked nationwide protests about the treatment of communities of color by law enforcement and a debate about the role of race in policing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Donovan argued that the disclosure would damage the credibility of prosecutors seeking to assure both grand jurors and witnesses that details of their participation would be kept from public view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The judge agreed that the argument "is particularly cogent in 'high publicity cases' where the witnesses' truthful and accurate testimony is vital."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Garnett wrote: "It is in such notorious cases that witnesses' cooperation and honesty should be encouraged - not discouraged - for fear of disclosure."</td></tr>

<h3>New Mexico House OKs gambling compact as deadline draws near</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The House voted 61-5 in favor on one of the last remaining big-ticket items on the calendar as the session nears adjournment Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The compact is the result of three years of negotiations by Gov. Susana Martinez's office, the Navajo Nation, the Mescalero and Jicarilla Apache tribes, and the pueblos of Jemez and Acoma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Among other things, the agreement allows casinos to stay open around the clock and to offer complimentary food and lodging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The compact also clears the way for the casinos to extend credit to high-rolling patrons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was previously approved by the state Senate, and it now requires final consideration by the U.S. Interior Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I am so relieved. I know the Navajo people are," Navajo President Ben Shelly said moments after the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was among the tribal leaders present on the House floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Shelly said it would have been devastating for the tribe had the Legislature not approved the compact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The tribe has invested more than $200 million in its gambling facilities, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Jicarilla Apache Nation "is very pleased" with the House vote and eager to work with the Interior Department to seek approval of "this historic compact," General Counsel Dion Killsback said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Legislature was under pressure to act this session because the current compact with the Navajo Nation and some of the other tribes expires in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If the tribes want to legally operate casinos, the new compact had to be approved by the Legislature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Jessica Hernandez, Martinez's deputy chief of staff and lead negotiator, said the compact is more socially responsible and will provide stability for New Mexico's gambling market for another two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It is a balanced approach that will provide economic development opportunities for tribes, protect the revenue the state receives in exchange for the valuable benefits it provides the tribes through the compacts, and ensure safe and responsible tribal gaming in New Mexico," she said in a statement issued Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sen. Clemente Sanchez, a Grants Democrat who chairs the compacts committee, has said the compact would increase revenues to the state during the next two decades beyond what existing compacts would offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tribes that operate casinos in New Mexico reported more than $731 million in net winnings in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Net winnings are the amount wagered on gambling machines, less the prizes won on those machines and regulatory fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>State officials say the tribes paid New Mexico more than $66 million last year under revenue-sharing agreements that call for the state to ensure gambling exclusivity for them in exchange for a percentage of net winnings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Revenue sharing under the compact is expected to top an estimated $77 million in 2019.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lawmakers say the compact will bring in $10 million more in the next fiscal year alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Several members of the House spoke in favor of the compact, calling it an economic driver for the state and for the prosperity of tribal lands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sharon Clahchischilliage, R-Kirtland, said the compact is reasonable and a "true compromise between the state and the tribes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Nine other New Mexico tribes operate under different compacts with the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Those agreements were approved in 2007 and won't expire until 2037.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Under the compact approved Thursday, those tribes would have the option to sign on to the new agreement, which in some cases would offer more favorable terms when it comes to sharing revenue with the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Under the formula outlined in the compact, revenue sharing would range from 8.5 percent to 10.75 percent depending on the amount of net winnings and the number of years the compact has been in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The compact also calls for tribes to submit monthly and quarterly reports to state regulators, and tribes would have to provide more information to players about resources to treat problem gambling.</td></tr>
