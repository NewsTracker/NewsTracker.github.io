<h3>AP ANALYSIS: US on sidelines of key Iraqi battle against IS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The campaign for Tikrit is a dress rehearsal for the real contest: The fight to recapture Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the extremists' biggest stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But can a large-scale ground offensive alone succeed, without U.S.-led air support?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Tikrit operation is aimed at stopping Islamic State fighters from closing in on Samarra, a Shiite holy city just to the south that tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen rushed to defend during the extremists' blitz across northern Iraq last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One of the biggest campaigns in the heart of militant-controlled Iraq, the battle for Tikrit involves a complex mix of several Iraqi military brigades and thousands of Shiite militiamen and Sunni tribal fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Directing the offensive with the aid of dozens of Iranian military advisers is a powerful Iranian general, Ghasem Soleimani, commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Glaringly absent are the U.S.-led coalition forces whose air campaign since last summer has nearly halted the Islamic State rampage across Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pentagon spokesman Army Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Steve Warren said this week that the U.S. is not providing air power in the Tikrit operation "simply because the Iraqis haven't requested us to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Liberating the city without the backing of coalition airstrikes will put Iraq's security forces to the ultimate battle-readiness test since any operation to recapture Iraq's densely-populated cities - including Mosul and Fallujah - will have to rely almost entirely on ground forces to minimize civilian casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, more of a concern for the U.S.-led coalition is Iran's prominent role in the fight against the Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Iran has long been influential in Iraq, but never so much so as over the past year, when the Iraqi military collapsed in the face of the Sunni extremists' onslaught.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Iraqi officials have noted Iran's quick response to their urgent requests for weapons and frontline assistance even as they accuse the coalition of falling short on commitments on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Embedding coalition advisers and forward air controllers - the officers who call in airstrikes - with Iraqi military units presents a twofold challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Frontline positions would put their lives in danger at a time when risk aversion is at its peak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But it also raises the potential for coalition forces and Iranian soldiers to share a battlefield, a politically untenable prospect for the U.S. given the uncertain future of ongoing nuclear talks with Tehran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>However, the U.S.-led mission has hit a roadblock in its efforts to support the Iraqi government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Both the Iraqi and U.S. government agree that airstrikes have pushed the militants back and the group has struggled to gain territory since airstrikes began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But there will come a point where airstrikes alone will not be enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Most of the battlefield successes in Iraq have been coordinated efforts, with Iraqi and Kurdish forces and Shiite militias fighting on the ground and the U.S.-led coalition providing air power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The siege on the village of Amirli just north of Baghdad, when many feared the capital itself might fall, was broken last year with the help of U.S.-led airstrikes and a fighting force of mainly Shiite militias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Shiite militiamen backed by a coalition air campaign also retook the town of Jurf al-Sukhr, on Baghdad's outskirts, from the militants in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Soleimani, the Iranian general leading the Tikrit operation, was a key player in both of those campaigns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Iraqi and Kurdish officials and Shiite militia fighters all acknowledge the crucial role the coalition airstrikes played in their modest victories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>With the military operation to retake Mosul planned for as early as April, many are skeptical about whether the Iraqi military will be ready for the fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Efforts to recruit Sunni tribes - seen as crucial for rooting out the militants from their strongholds - have yielded few results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Training and arming of Iraqi soldiers have also stalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The failure so far to make headway in Tikrit does not bode well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Iraqi forces are bogged down on the outskirts of the city, unable to penetrate the extremists' defenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>On Tuesday, a suicide bomber drove a military vehicle into a checkpoint manned by government forces and Shiite fighters south of Tikrit, killing four troops and wounding 12, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The stalemate persists despite assurances from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi that momentum is on Iraq's side after recent successes in the oil refinery town of Beiji - an operation that received heavy aerial support from the U.S.-led coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Islamic State group, which controls a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate, has littered major roadways with mines that slow any ground advance and require painstaking clearance operations before troops can safely move through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Kurdish and Iraqi forces frequently cite bomb-detecting equipment as one of their biggest shortfalls on the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The battle for Tikrit is likely to involve Iraq's first serious urban warfare challenge, involving street battles that Iraqi security forces are not trained for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Concerns are also mounting over the Shiite militias' battlefield conduct in a largely Sunni region where some residents are said to have initially welcomed the Islamic State militants as a better alternative to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In their earlier battlefield successes, the Shiite fighters often flattened towns and villages so as to prevent Sunni residents from returning home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Winning over the Sunni tribes is essential because they know the terrain of the Sunni-majority areas under Islamic State control and can fight with and advise the Shiite fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But animosity has reached a peak and fragile battlefield alliances could be short-lived once the common enemy is eliminated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>And heavy Iranian involvement only threatens to exacerbate sectarian tensions.</td></tr>
