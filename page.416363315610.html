<h3>Baltimore investigates death of man in police custody</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Baltimore police were conducting a criminal investigation Sunday into the death of a man injured in their custody, and the mayor vowed to ensure the city held "the right people accountable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Freddie Gray, 25, of Baltimore, died Sunday at a hospital, a week after he was hurt following an arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A timeline released earlier in the week by police said Gray was taken by a van from the scene to a station, where an ambulance was called to treat him and take him to the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Civilian video showed him being loaded into the van, but did not show the entire encounter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An attorney retained by Gray's family, Billy Murphy, described extensive injuries in a statement Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"His spine was 80 percent severed at his neck. He lapsed into a coma, died, was resuscitated, stayed in a coma and on Monday, underwent extensive surgery at Shock Trauma to save his life," Murphy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He clung to life for seven days and died today at approximately 7 a.m."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and top police officials promised accountability and transparency Sunday at a news conference at City Hall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said a criminal investigation was underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's a two-part investigation. One is a criminal case, for Mr. Gray and also the officers. We always have that component in there to determine whether there is criminal culpability," Rodriguez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Rodriguez declined to specify why four bicycle officers stopped Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We had officers in a high-crime area known to have high narcotic incidents," he said "The officers believe that Mr. Gray was immediately involved or recently involved in criminal activity and decided to make contact."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rawlings-Blake said she had the same questions as reporters: "How was Mr. Gray injured? Were the proper protocols and procedures actually followed? What are the next steps to take from here?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She promised a thorough investigation and "real answers" for the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I will ensure we will hold the right people accountable," Rawlings-Blake said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Gray's family has declined, so far, to interact with police, said Police Commissioner Anthony Batts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said the department would try again this week to share information with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Today, on this holy day, a mother has lost her son," Batts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Freddie Gray passed. My greatest hope and wish and desire is that any time we have an interaction as a police department or a contact, that everyone goes home safe. All lives matter. All lives matter in this city."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The department, an independent review board and the Baltimore prosecutor's office will investigate the case, Batts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Justice League NYC, which organized a rally Saturday night at the station where Gray was taken, held another protest Sunday afternoon at the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The first event was scheduled as the league's "March2Justice" reached Baltimore on its way to a rally Tuesday in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Enough is enough! Police brutality must end!" the group said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Gray was black; the race of the officers involved could not immediately be confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>His death came amid a national debate about the deaths of black men at the hands of police.</td></tr>
