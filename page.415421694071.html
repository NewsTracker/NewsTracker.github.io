<h3>PICTURED: Frantic bid to save woman after whale crashed into side of boat in Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Canadian tourist Jennifer Karren, 35, was part of a group of nine visitors on a snorkel tour in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, when the sudden collision took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cabo Adventures, who operated the tour, said that the captain tried to turn when the whale first appeared but it quickly struck the vessel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A statement describes how force of the crash threw Canadian Jennifer Karren, 35, overboard before she died in the water from a head trauma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It also said that she was pulled back into the boat and immediately received mouth-to-mouth resuscitation form another tourist, who happened to be a qualified nurse, before naval rescue paramedics took her to the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Another two tourists were also taken to hospital, but one was released and the other's injuries were not life-threatening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Officials identified the creature as a grey whale, but a whale specialist from the Baja California State University believes that it was almost certainly a humpback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said: "This is the first time in 30 years of studying whales that I have heard about an accident like this, in which passengers are pitched into the sea and one dies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However collisions between whales and boats are not unheard of in Mexico, where whales come to breed in coastal lagoons during the winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In January 2014 a humpback whale crashed into a boat off the coast of Baja California, injuring a US tourist and three other people on board.</td></tr>
