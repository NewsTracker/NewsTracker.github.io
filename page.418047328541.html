<h3>Pedroia goes on Boston disabled list with strained hamstring (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BOSTON (AP) -- Second baseman Dustin Pedroia was put on the 15-day disabled list by the Boston Red Sox on Thursday, a day after straining right hamstring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pedroia was hurt rounding first base after his go-ahead, two-run single in the sixth inning of Wednesday night's 5-1 victory over Baltimore and limped off the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Pedroia is hitting .306 with nine homers and 33 RBIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''The way he plays, what he means in the clubhouse, and what he means on the field with his performance, probably having a career year to date,'' Farrell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''Hopefully, this is on the shorter end of time missed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Boston demoted struggling right-hander Joe Kelly to Triple-A Pawtucket, where he will make his next start Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''The options would have been to put him in the bullpen or send him down to start,'' Farrell said of Kelly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''This centers on command of the baseball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's certainly not stuff, not athleticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kelly is 2-5 with a 5.67 ERA in 14 starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Right fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. was recalled from Pawtucket and was batting ninth Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Red Sox also selected the contracts of right-hander Jonathan Aro and infielder Deven Marrero from Pawtucket.</td></tr>
