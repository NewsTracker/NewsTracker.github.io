<h3>Justice Department likely to sue Ferguson police department: report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It was previously reported that the federal agency is unlikely to bring any civil rights charges against former Officer Darren Wilson for the death of teenager Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But now it seems the Justice Department may threaten to sue the police department if they do not change some of their practices and procedures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sources told CNN that investigators had uncovered a number of violations in Ferguson and at departments in neighboring areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That included allegedly targeting low-income groups for minor traffic violations, then imprisoning them when they couldn't pay their fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Speaking at the National Press Club Tuesday, Attorney General Eric Holder said he expects to announce the results of the department's Ferguson investigation before he leaves office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He is expected to depart in the coming weeks, though Mr. Holder is still waiting for the Senate to confirm his replacement, Loretta Lynch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In November, a grand jury decided not to bring any charges against Mr. Wilson, setting off protests and violent riots nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Many civil rights advocates then turned their attention to the Justice Department, which has been conducting its own investigation into the shooting.</td></tr>
