<tr><td>5</td><td>MOSCOW (AP) - Leading Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny was released Friday after spending 15 days in custody and vowed that he and his supporters will not be intimidated by the slaying of a top Kremlin critic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Navalny, the driving force behind the 2011-2012 mass protests in Moscow, said the killing of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov will not force him to scale down his campaign against President Vladimir Putin's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This act of terror hasn't achieved its goal, it will not frighten me or my comrades," Navalny said after his release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We will not reduce our efforts, we will not step back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Navalny walked free after serving the sentence handed down by a Moscow court, which found him guilty of violating the law when he distributed leaflets in the subway campaigning for an opposition rally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The protest was turned into a mourning march to pay tributes to Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, a former deputy prime minister and one of Putin's most vehement critics, was killed just outside the Kremlin hours after a radio interview in which he denounced the president for his "mad, aggressive" policies in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Before his death, Nemtsov was working on a report about Russian involvement in the war in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>No suspects have been detained in the killing, despite an reward of 3 million rubles (nearly $50,000) offered for information related to the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kremlin critics say the spiteful nationalist propaganda on state television, which cast Nemtsov and other liberals as Western stooges, helped prepare the ground for his killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Many believe that his shooting death in a tightly secured area near the Kremlin wouldn't have been possible without official involvement, and could be an attempt to scare other government foes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Putin dubbed Nemtsov's killing a "provocation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The nation's top investigative agency echoed that comment, saying it was looking into whether Nemtsov had been a "sacrificial victim" to destabilize Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It said it was also investigating whether Islamic extremism, the Ukraine conflict and Nemtsov's personal life were possible motives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A court rejected Navalny's plea for early release to attend Nemtsov's funeral Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Navalny was convicted in late December of fraud and given a -year suspended sentence and ordered to remain under house arrest until his appeals were exhausted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He has repeatedly violated his house arrest since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Navalny's brother was imprisoned under the verdict, which many see as a vendetta by the Kremlin.</td></tr>
