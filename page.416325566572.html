<h3>CAS hears Serbia, Albania appeal after Euro 2016 drone match</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Court of Arbitration for Sport has heard appeals by the Serbian and Albanian football federations challenging UEFA sanctions after their European Championship qualifier was abandoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A chaotic match in Belgrade last October was stopped before halftime then called off when a drone carrying an Albanian nationalist banner flew into the stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Players clashed on the pitch and the Albania team refused to play after being attacked by Serbian fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>UEFA ordered Albania to forfeit the match, and awarded Serbia a 3-0 default win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, Serbia was deducted all three points for the win and ordered to host two Euro 2016 qualifiers in an empty stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>UEFA also fined both federations 100,000 euros ($108,000).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>CAS said in a statement that the two federations' appeals were heard Thursday and Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The court panel aims to give a verdict before Serbia plays at Denmark on June 13 in the next round of qualifying match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Balkan rivals' return match is scheduled in Albania on Oct. 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tensions between the countries were fueled by Kosovo, a province dominated by ethnic Albanians, declaring independence from Serbia in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Serbia already served one match of its empty-stadium sanction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It lost to Denmark 3-1 in November and next hosts Armenia on Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At the midway point in the five-team group, Portugal and Denmark are in the two automatic qualifying places for Euro 2016 in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Albania is in third place, level on points with Denmark, which guarantees at least a spot in the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Albanians have seven points, six ahead of fourth-place Serbia.</td></tr>
