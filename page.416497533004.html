<h3>Arctic Council summit: environment consensus ruffled by Russia-Ukraine tensions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry, Canadian Minister for the Arctic Council Leona Aglukkaq, and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Rob Nicholson with Inuit at the Arctic Council Ministerial meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Iqaluit: The United States and seven other Arctic nations have vowed to work together to combat climate change at the top of the world and put aside tensions over Ukraine and Russian military activities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As the US assumed chairmanship of the Arctic Council, a multinational group formed to address environmental and economic issues, Secretary of State John Kerry said the Arctic is undergoing profound climate change at an alarming pace that will affect northern coastal communities and, eventually, the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Shrinking: The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on the planet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We're on a dangerous path," said Mr Kerry, citing rising methane and soot emissions from diesel engines, airplane exhaust and wood-burning fires, all of which cover snow and absorb the sun's heat, speeding warming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Arctic sea ice this year was the smallest in winter since satellite records began in 1979, according to US data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The region is warming at twice the rate of other parts of the globe, which both threatens traditional communities even as it opens up new sea lanes and vast oil and mineral resources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>During the meeting, the nations sought to play down their divisions, notably over Russia's March 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine as well as the West's view - denied by Russia - that Russian troops support separatists in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Environmental issues: John Kerry at the Arctic Council ministerial meeting in Iqaluit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Russia also caused unease in March when it began military exercises across the country, including in the Arctic, involving more than 45,000 troops as well as war planes and submarines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Noticeably absent from the meeting was Russian Foreign Minister Sergey , missing his first Arctic Council biennial meeting in more than a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He cited a scheduling change, and Russia's environmental minister, Sergei , came in his place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Leona , Canada's minister for the Arctic Council, met Mr on Thursday and condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She refrained from rebuking Russia in public, and said geopolitics will not chip away at the council's commitment to cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sentiment: Russia's environmental minister Sergei Donskoi alluded to the need to rise above tensions over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Kerry said Mr had told him Russia wants to keep geopolitics separate from the Arctic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The sentiment was echoed by officials from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Russia itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yet Norway's government last week proposed updating where the polar ice cap ends, paving the way for oil exploration further north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr alluded to the need to rise above the tensions as he praised efforts to prevent a major oil spill in Arctic waters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There is no room here for confrontation or fear-mongering," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But , a Russian deputy prime minister who is blacklisted from travelling to most of Europe, provoked a diplomatic scuffle a few days earlier when he passed through Norway on his way to the North Pole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr was leading a delegation to open a scientific research station on a shrinking ice cap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The Arctic," he boasted on Twitter, "is a Russian Mecca".</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The comments underscored how the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia over Russia's intervention in Ukraine has strained the council's mission as a changing climate has intensified economic and political competition in the Arctic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Russia's involvement in Ukraine has resulted in sanctions and travel bans on dozens of officials, like Mr , and a prohibition on the sale of American technology and services to help Russia tap its energy resources in the Arctic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>President Vladimir Putin views those as hostile acts and has responded by stepping up air patrols along Russia's borders with NATO nations, including those that are members of the Arctic Council.</td></tr>
