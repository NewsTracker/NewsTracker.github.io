<tr><td>30</td><td>The gunmen also told students hiding in dormitories to come out, assuring them that they would not be killed, said Titus, who wore a patient's gown as she sat on a bench in the hospital yard.</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>"They were shot there and then," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Those who surrendered were either selected for killing, or freed in some cases, apparently because they were Muslim, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The killers shouted "God is great" in Arabic, she said.</td></tr>
