<h3>Is Benfica youth player Romario Balde's panenka penalty the worst ever? The goalkeeper had enough time to dive the wrong way, get back up and save the shot?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>With Benfica holding a fragile 1-0 lead over Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League, it was not the time for any player from the Portuguese side to try anything flamboyant in front of goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Unfortunately, that is exactly what Romario Balde did when he seized control of a penalty for his side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Instead of lashing the ball into a corner and hoping his accuracy beat the dive of the goalkeeper, he tried to chip the ball down the middle and into the goal - a panenka penalty kick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The skill is named after Antonin Panenka's penalty at Euro 1976 for Czechoslovakia against Germany but Balde lacked all of the conviction that made Panenka's kick famous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His kick was so feeble and light that the Shakhtar goalkeeper had enough time to dive the wrong way, regain his balance and claim the ball before it trickled over the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And things did not get any better for Balde or Benfica.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was substituted, Benfica ended up drawing 1-1 before crashing out of the competition - on penalties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The panenka has been replicated by the likes of Andrea Pirlo and Zinedine Zidane, but Balde is unlikely to want to try it in an important game any time soon.</td></tr>

<h3>Sierra Leone plans another 3-day shutdown to stop Ebola's spread</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- Sierra Leone is planning another three-day, countrywide shutdown March 27 through 29 to ferret out Ebola cases, remind people how to protect themselves from the disease and control its transmission.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>In what Sierra Leone hopes will be a final push to zero cases, Alfred Palo Conteh, head of the country's Ebola response, said Wednesday that the government will again ask residents to stay in their homes for three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government has done this before, and some experts said it was unexpectedly effective in providing information about to control the disease.</td></tr>
