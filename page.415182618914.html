<h3>Bali nine prisoners transferred from Kerobokan to execution island under heavy military guard</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They arrived at the nearby port town of Cilacap in a chartered civilian plane shadowed by two Sukhoi fighter jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran handcuffed arriving at Cilacap airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They were taken from the airport to Cilacap port in a long and dramatic convoy, with police cars' sirens blaring and military vehicles packed with members of the army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There were chaotic scenes at the harbour with armed military officers and police lined up and down the street and police cars choking he narrow entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The development comes amid signs of a breakdown in communication between the Indonesian and Australian governments, with Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop admitting on Wednesday there had been no official confirmation from Indonesian officials that a transfer was going to take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Indonesian police armoured vehicles carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran move into a ferry to be transferred to the penal island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Australians left Denpasar airport at 7am, local time, accompanied by a large contingent of members of the elite paramilitary police, known as Brimob, on the Wings Air jet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The extraordinary security measures reflect concerns about an unspecified threat but also show how the execution of the pair has been swept up by nationalist fervour and turned into a spectacle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They were also accompanied by the man formally in charge of the transfer, Bali's chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Michael Chan leaves Kerobakan prison with Andrew Chan's girlfriend, Feby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At the penal island in Central Java, the pair will be moved into specially prepared isolation cells and await news of when their executions will take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It is not yet known how long Chan and Sukumaran will have on Nusakambangan before they are executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They will be shot dead alongside eight other drug felons in a mass execution, according to plans revealed so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Wolf armoured personnel carrier leaves Kerobokan prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Attorney-General H.M Prasetyo has said he will set a date for the execution once all 10 drug felons are on the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The prisoners will be given 72 hours' notification before they are killed, with the Attorney-General expected to give a press conference to announce when this period will begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He has said the executions will occur as soon as possible to prevent other prisoners from being unsettled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A Wolf armoured vehicle carrying Bali nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran leaves Kerobokan prison to begin the transfer to Nusakambangan prison island where they are to be executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran were able to take only personal belongings with them to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While they wait, they will be allowed to meet their families, lawyers and receive comfort from religious figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They have joined about 2000 other prisoners on the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Michael Chan leaves Kerobokan prison after attempting to see his brother Andrew Chan before his transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Known as the Alcatraz of Indonesia, Nusakambangan contains maximum-security prisons holding convicted terrorists, murderers, drug dealers and political dissidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The inmates - many wearing prison garb in shades of blue - are believed to be held in the network of seven high-walled prisons, built by Dutch colonists in 1908.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Riot police gather outside Kerobokan prison for the transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In the early hours of Wednesday, Chan and Sukumaran were taken from Kerobokan prison under heavy military guard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They were driven through the gates of Kerobokan in a Wolf armoured personnel carrier, followed by police in a Barracuda armoured vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Streets were blocked off and two buses of crowd-control police carrying riot shields and batons were deployed along with a contingent of military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Indonesian police block the street near the entrance of Kerobokan prison where Bali nine duo Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will be transferred to Nusakambangan prison island for their executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A water cannon was stationed outside the prison in case of trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Australians were then taken to Denpasar airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It was earlier reported they would be flown in Hercules and CN295 military planes, one for the prisoners and their guards, one for security personnel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Christie Buckingham, a pastor from Bayside Church in Melbourne, who has been providing solace to the Chan and Sukumaran families in Australia, on Wednesday described the show of force as completely unnecessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Indonesian police stand in front of a water cannon that has been positioned outside Kerobokan prison ahead of the transfer of Bali nine duo Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"It's just so absurd. Anyone who knows Andrew and Myu knows they are both so gentle. They would always go peacefully. They are men of integrity," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Andrew Chan's brother Michael said he was struggling to comprehend the enormity of the transfer of his brother to the place of his execution, expressing his disappointment at not being able to see his brother before he was moved out of Kerobokan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Andrew Chan, one of the Bali nine duo, photographed yesterday in Kerobokan prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mr Chan and Andrew's Indonesian girlfriend Febyanti Herewila, known as Feby, arrived at Kerobokan just after 5am local time, within 30 minutes of the transfer, marching through the police cordon and media presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Ms Herewila was in tears as they pleaded their case, trying to convince prison officials to let them enter the penitentiary, but were rebuffed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Mr Chan said it was not unexpected but nonetheless upsetting that news of the transfer emerged only after he and Sukumaran's mother had left the prison on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran walks through the grounds of Kerobokan prison yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"It was definitely disappointing," he told Fairfax Media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"We are just trying to digest it all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"It was a last-minute thing and it was a gamble but, yeah, we hoped to see Andrew."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Mr Chan was frantically arranging a flight to Cilacap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The families will be able to see the pair on the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Andrew's mother, Helen Chan, was on Wednesday afternoon departing Sydney for Indonesia, so she can say goodbye to her son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Ms Bishop said she was "utterly dismayed" to learn that the Australians were being moved from Kerobokan prison without all of their legal avenues having been exhausted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>She said Indonesian officials had still not informed the Australian government of the proposed date the executions would take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"They [Indonesian officials] are in touch with our consular officials in Bali," Ms Bishop said in an interview on Channel Nine's Today Show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"We have not received any official information as to the proposed transfer of Mr Sukumaran or Mr Chan. I ... asked that the Australian government be kept informed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Asked if there would be repercussions from the Australian government if the men were executed, Ms Bishop responded: "I am sure that Indonesia understands it will have consequences."</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Ms Bishop said she was planning to speak to Chan and Sukumaran's families on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Todung Mulya Lubis, the lawyer representing Chan and Sukumaran, has pleaded with Indonesian authorities to "please wait" before executing the pair until all of their legal avenues have been exhausted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>In a statement on Tuesday, lawyers said the men had challenged the dismissal to their appeal in the Jakarta State Administrative Court on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Mr Prasetyo said on Monday that pending legal appeals would not have any impact on the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that Australia must not let anger undermine its relationship with Indonesia if Chan and Sukumaran are executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>He said that, whatever might happen in the next few days, the relationship with Indonesia must endure and, over time, it must grow stronger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>He has expressed hope the better angels of the Indonesian nature will reassert themselves at this late hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>He has not spoken to Mr Joko in recent days but, in a call last week, said he had made crystal clear Australia's opposition to the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Mr Abbott said he understood millions of Australians would be feeling sick about the pending executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>He was still hopeful that Chan and Sukumaran would be given a reprieve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>"Even at the 11th hour, I hope that there might be a change of heart in Indonesia and these executions might be stopped," Mr Abbott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>He said he continued to make representations to the Indonesian government that "this execution would be against their best interests, and it would be against their best values".</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>"The point that I've been making again and again is that, yes, these two men have done a terrible thing, but they've now been in jail for about a decade, and in that time they have been well and truly rehabilitated. So as things stand today, these two men are actually allies of the Indonesian government in its fight against drug crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>"I know that Indonesia has a ... horrible, horrible drug problem, and I absolutely appreciate and accept Indonesia's desire to fight very hard indeed against their drug menace, but these two Australians are actually assets in the fight against drugs and that's why I think these executions make no sense whatsoever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>An Australian business delegation to Indonesia led by Trade Minister Andrew Robb planned for this month has been quietly shelved amid escalating tensions between the countries ahead of the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Asked whether government ministers might be banned from travelling to Indonesia if the executions took place, Mr Abbott said: "I don't want to flag what might happen should these executions go ahead."</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Lawyer Julian McMahon spoke to both men for several hours on Tuesday night, briefing them on the unstinting legal and diplomatic efforts to save their lives, walking with Sukumaran around the prison grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>After he left, the men quietly began preparing for their final night, a prison source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>"Myuran was painting and Andrew was praying and comforting others. They were both making sure everyone had the right things," the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Sukumaran - recently awarded a degree in fine arts from Curtin University - had already handed his most precious art books and canvases to his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>As well as painting, he spent his last night making final arrangements to ensure the art studio he founded continued to operate following his departure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>"Andrew said he wanted to know if he could talk to the [paramilitary police] guards who were taking him," the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>"He was lovely."</td></tr>
