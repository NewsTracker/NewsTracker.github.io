<h3>Saban: NFL draft evaluations affected Alabama chemistry (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Alabama coach Nick Saban thinks something happened to his team's chemistry between the Southeastern Conference championship game and the national semifinals against Ohio State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Saban said Wednesday at SEC media days one factor was that six juniors received their evaluations for the NFL draft during that period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He wants that date pushed back until after the final game to prevent such potential distractions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''We had six guys in this situation this past year and 11 the year before,'' Saban said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Whatever the reason, a defense that shut down Missouri was manhandled by Ohio State in the College Football Playoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The potent offense made some costly mistakes - including three turnovers - and for the second straight year the Crimson Tide fell short of a national title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Receiver Amari Cooper was Alabama's only first-round pick last season, though tailback T.J. Yeldon and safety Landon Collins were early second-rounders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>All three were underclassmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is more of an issue with Alabama than most programs, with an annual early exodus of star players to the NFL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''I'd say guys got distracted by people in their ear,'' said linebacker Reggie Ragland, who opted to return for his senior season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''With me, the people that were in my ear, I wouldn't answer the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I was just worried about playing football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''A lot of guys got sidetracked by that, but I think this year coming up we've got a lot of guys that are not worried about the NFL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ohio State beat Alabama 42-35 on its way to the national title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ragland said the Buckeyes were ''a formidable opponent'' but feels the Tide could have at least shown up with a better performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Alabama's defense, typically among the nation's best, has been victimized late in back-to-back seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ragland thinks teams aren't as intimidated as they once were when facing the Tide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''Guys aren't scared to play us anymore,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''That's a fact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Guys are coming in very happy and excited to play us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>I used to see teams break down in the first half and just give up playing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Now, the Tide must replace nine offensive starters, including quarterback Blake Sims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sims' backup, Jake Coker, and David Cornwell are vying to be the starting quarterback, and Saban said he has no timetable for making that call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But those are preseason concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Postseason was the main topic Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Ultimately, Alabama is hoping to be in position to contend for titles and come through at the end this time after a stretch when the Tide won three national championships in four years.</td></tr>
