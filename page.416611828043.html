<tr><td>22</td><td>(AP) - A police sergeant who responded to the Colorado theater shooting recalled in court Wednesday how he saw James Holmes lying on the ground in the parking lot as two officers arrested him and stripped off his helmet and body armor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sgt. Spc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Gerald Jonsgaard did not use Holmes' name, instead describing his white shirt with blue squares and glasses and pointing out that he had longer hair that was bright orange at the time of the July 20, 2012, attack that left 12 people dead and 70 injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It was the first time in the trial that a witness described Holmes as the gunman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Previous witnesses either didn't see Holmes at all or only saw a masked gunman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Jonsgaard also described a chaotic scene in the theater, where sirens sounded and lights flashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"All the cellphones that were left, were lying on the ground, were ringing. That kept going on all night long," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Despite the confusion, he had a moment to do something compassionate: asking an officer to carry 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, who had been wounded, out of the theater even though he did not think she was still alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I wasn't keeping a child in a crime scene. I didn't want my officers stepping over her. I didn't want her at the scene," he said of the youngest person to die in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Her pregnant mother was also wounded, miscarried and left paralyzed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Holmes' lawyers did not question Jonsgaard, just as they did not question any of the 10 witnesses who testified Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Most of them were victims and people who had been watching the showing of a new Batman movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>They may be trying to avoid dragging out the gruesome details a minute longer than necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In opening statements Monday, they acknowledged that Holmes was the killer and that the attack was horrific, but they said schizophrenia had taken over his mind and compelled him to kill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>His attorneys hope to convince the jury that he didn't know right from wrong at the time of the massacre and should be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Prosecutors aim to prove that Holmes knew what he was doing was illegal and immoral and should be sentenced to die.</td></tr>
