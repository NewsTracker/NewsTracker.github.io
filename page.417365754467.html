<h3>Tunisia PM: Destroying migrant boats won't stop Europe flow</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LISBON, Portugal (AP) - Tunisia's prime minister says a European Union proposal to destroy boats used by smugglers to ferry migrants to Europe from Libya probably won't work and is risky because it is similar to military intervention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Habib Essid told reporters Friday during a visit to Lisbon that authorities must fight the root of the illegal migration problem by helping raise living standards in the countries the migrants come from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said intervention to destroy the rickety boats before they cross the Mediterranean "is considered by Tunisia as almost a military intervention."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The majority of migrants travel from Libya to Italy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>More than 1,800 are believed to have died or gone missing at sea this year.</td></tr>
