<h3>Obama: Netanyahu Statements Don't Clarify Two-State Solution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Obama said he still takes Netanyahu at his word for comments the Israeli leader made just ahead of the Israeli elections last week that a Palestinian state would not be created while he was prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He acknowledged that Netanyahu later pointed out that he did not say a Palestinian state would "never" be created.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"But, of course, the conditions were such that they would be impossible to meet any time soon," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The friction between the two leaders over the two-state solution issue comes on the heels of bitter disagreements over the U.S. role in international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Netanyahu has decried the talks, saying they are leading to a deal that would place Israel at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Obama has said the deal would only be finalized if it increases security for the U.S., Israel and the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Obama noted a tendency in reporting to frame the current dispute as a personal issue between Netanyahu and Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said he has a "businesslike" relationship with Netanyahu, and has met with him more than any other world leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"So the issue is not a matter of relations between leaders. The issue is a very clear substantive challenge," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This can't be reduced to a matter of somehow let's hold hands and sing kumbaya."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Obama says no one has envisioned the creation of a Palestinian state "overnight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But he said the goal is to give Palestinians hope for a secure state adjoining Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's hard to envision how that happens based on the prime minister's statements," Obama said.</td></tr>
