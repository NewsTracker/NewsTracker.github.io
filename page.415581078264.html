<tr><td>5</td><td>British trainers will run a series of combat first aid courses at bases across the country, said Ukrainian defense ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzianik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Assistance is being aimed at preventing further Ukrainian fatalities and casualties, Britain's defense ministry said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It is unclear what tactical insight instructors will be providing, but the British defense ministry said it would "help improve situational awareness on the ground."</td></tr>
