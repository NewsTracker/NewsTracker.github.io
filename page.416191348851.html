<h3>Would-be extremist recruit from Jamaica detained in Suriname</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a statement, Suriname's police force said the 16-year-old was denied entry after arriving at the country's main airport on a Saturday flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The teen, whose identity was not disclosed, was apparently trying to fly to the Netherlands and then to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An intelligence agency Suriname police did not identify informed them that the Jamaican apparently intended to slip into Syria to join Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After being questioned and obtaining background information on the youth, he was flown back to Jamaica.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jamaica's national security ministry did not provide comment Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last month, the ministry insisted there was "no evidence" of Jamaicans joining the Islamic State group or other terrorist groups a few days after a U.S. general identified the island as one of the Caribbean nations that have produced roughly 100 would-be militants fighting with Islamic extremists in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gen. John Kelly, who heads the U.S. Southern Command, has said Iran and Islamic extremist groups were doing a "fair amount" of recruiting in the region, and said some people have become radicalized through the Internet and others through radical mosques.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He listed Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, Suriname and Venezuela as regional countries where officials believe recruits have departed for Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Overall, the Caribbean is apparently a small source of foreign fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A recent U.N. report said the number of fighters leaving home to join al-Qaida and the Islamic State group has spiked to more than 25,000 from over 100 nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The report mentioned an increase in fighters from countries including Trinidad, where a ragtag group of Muslim militants attempted to overthrow the government in 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>During President Barack Obama's trip to Jamaica last week to meet with Caribbean Community leaders, Trinidad Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar issued a statement saying she was "very concerned of the threat of terrorism" for her country and for the region.</td></tr>
