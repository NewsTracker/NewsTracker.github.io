<h3>MH17 attackers will still face justice despite peace deal 'amnesty': Julie Bishop</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has hailed a "breakthrough" ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, but does not expect the deal to stymie efforts to bring the MH17 attackers to justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Russia has distributed text of the agreement, which includes a pledge of "amnesty" to prohibit punishment for "events that took place in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine".</td></tr>
