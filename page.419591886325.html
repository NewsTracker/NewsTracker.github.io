<h3>Trump vows never to eat Oreos again, citing move to Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump repeated his claim Tuesday evening that he would stop eating Oreos, citing the cookie maker's decision to close a plant in Chicago and move it to Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Trump's claim is partly true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Oreo's parent company Mondelez International Inc. said last month that it decided to invest $130 million in building four new production lines at a plant in Mexico, which will replace nine older production lines at its Chicago plant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That will mean the number of jobs at the Chicago plant will go from about 1,200 to about 600, said Laurie Guzzinati, a Mondelez representative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the plant in Chicago will remain open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Guzzinati said the decision to invest in the Mexico plant came after discussions with union representatives for workers at the Chicago plant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She said the company determined that the new production lines would cost $46 million less per year in Mexico than in Chicago, and said labor was "one of many factors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Guzzinati noted that Oreos continue to be made in some U.S. plants, including in New Jersey, Oregon and Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Mondelez plant in Salinas, Mexico, opened in late 2014, and the four additional production lines are expected to be completed by mid-2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Two of those lines will make Oreo cookies, Guzzinati said.</td></tr>
