<h3>Liberia reports new case of Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Liberia had the most deaths in the world's largest Ebola outbreak, but has not had a case for more than two weeks and was counting down to being declared Ebola-free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Francis Kateh, the acting head of the country's Ebola Incident Management Team, said a test has come back positive for a female patient in the capital Monrovia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A second test is generally done to confirm the diagnosis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tolbert Nyenswah, who runs Liberia's Ebola response, said he had been told a person had tested positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said the patient has been transferred to a treatment centre in Monrovia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dr Kateh said: "It is confirmed, we've got the first test and it is confirmed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a worrying sign, it is not clear where the woman became infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She doesn't seem to be linked to any of the people on a list of contacts of other Ebola patients, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We have to investigate where the person came from. Did they travel out of the country?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Countries must wait 42 days from when the last patient tests negative to be declared free of the virus.</td></tr>
