<h3>Apple CEO rips "religious freedom" legislation</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook is among the high-profile names speaking out against it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In an opinion piece in the Washington Post, he said, "There's something very dangerous happening in states across the country," reports CBS News correspondent Adriana Diaz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The law doesn't take effect until July, but it's already having an impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>From Indianapolis to Silicon Valley, backlash over Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act continues to mount.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the Washington Post op-ed, Cook openly criticized the law and similar legislation across the country that he said "goes against the very principles our nation was founded on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"On behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation wherever it emerges," Cook wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I'm writing in the hopes that many more will join this movement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The open letter came on the same day Indiana Governor Mike Pence adamantly defended the legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We simply stepped forward for the purpose of recognizing the religious liberty rights of all the people of Indiana of every faith," Pence said on ABC's "This Week."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At issue -- the message behind the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Supporters say it protects a person or business owner from government persecution when following their religious beliefs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But opponents say the measure gives businesses a free pass to refuse gay and lesbian customers on religious grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Cook, who publicly announced his homosexuality last year, said, "As a child, I was baptized in a Baptist church. I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With the final four headed to Indianapolis, former NBA star Charles Barkley is urging NCAA officials to move this week's games out of the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Restaurant owner Cynthia Wilson is worried how the financial fallout could affect future business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pence told the Indianapolis Star newspaper he's in talks with legislative leaders and a second bill could be introduced clarifying that the law does not promote discrimination against gays and lesbians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Consumer review website Angie's List announced it will suspend a planned headquarters expansion in Indianapolis that could have added 1,000 jobs.</td></tr>
