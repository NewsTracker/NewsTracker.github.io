<h3>Egypt's antiquities ministry urges Egyptians to donate to buy ancient statue sold by museum</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO - Egypt's antiquities minister is urging Egyptians to raise nearly $25 million so that the country can buy back an ancient Egyptian statue sold by an English museum to an unknown party, which Egypt says sets a dangerous precedent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mamdouh el-Damaty said Saturday that a British ban on the statue leaving the country, which expires on Friday, means that the need is urgent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He says the statue of Sekhemka could end up in a private collection unless other parties are able to collect the funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The sale is deemed legal in Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egypt, home to a massive wealth of ancient antiquities, banned their sale in 1983.</td></tr>
