<h3>Germanwings co-pilot Lubitz's estate is declared bankrupt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The estate of the Germanwings co-pilot believed to have intentionally crashed a passenger plane into the Alps in March has been declared bankrupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attorney Joachim Glaeser said Friday that he filed for bankruptcy on behalf of the estate this week in Montabaur, co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's hometown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Glaeser said the filing was necessary because the estate's debts are expected to exceed its worth, and because no heirs came forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Anyone who had come forward to inherit his property would also have had to take on any debts from possible claims on the estate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Glaeser wouldn't say how much Lubitz's estate is worth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prosecutors believe Lubitz intentionally crashed the Airbus A320 into a French mountain on March 24, killing all 150 people on board.</td></tr>
