<h3>Brut? Champagne spraying just F1 fun for Hamilton</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MANAMA (Reuters) - World champion Lewis Hamilton has said he was just trying to show the fun side of Formula One when he sprayed champagne in the face of a Chinese Grand Prix podium hostess last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sunday's incident, captured in photographs that showed the woman flinching as the Mercedes driver aimed a stream of fizz at her, triggered condemnation from critics in Britain and Germany as well as on Chinese social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The woman herself played down what happened in an interview with the Shanghai Daily newspaper and Hamilton said he was relieved to hear that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Ultimately it was a great weekend, and generally my actions are through excitement," the Briton told reporters after arriving at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This is Formula One, it's he pinnacle of motor sport and I'd just won a grand prix for the team. You should see it was a kind of a fun thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I would never, ever intend to disrespect or try to embarrass someone like that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hamilton said it had not overshadowed his week because he had only just been briefed on the controversy, and he questioned why it had been brought up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is a sport that so many people love, and the more we show character and fun it reflects just how great this sport is, and that's what I try to do," said the 30-year-old championship leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Shanghai Daily quoted 22-year-old Liu Siying, a graduate of the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art, as saying the incident "lasted for only one or two seconds, and I didn't think too much about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic than local media," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I was just told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that's what I did."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hamilton was speaking after Britain's Times newspaper condemned his behaviour in a leader column.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Hamilton is a great driver but nothing gives him the right to behave like a hooligan. Not even winning," it declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The practice of jubilant drivers spraying champagne on the podium has become a ritual dating back decades, even if some critics see it as uncouth while others shudder at the waste of good bubbly.</td></tr>
