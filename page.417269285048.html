<h3>Libyan tribes meet in Cairo as Egypt seeks allies against militants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO, May 25 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Libyan tribal leaders met in Cairo on Monday with Egyptian authorities hoping to enlist their help in preventing Islamist violence from spilling over their shared border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Islamist militants have thrived in the chaos of Libya, a North African oil producer that now has two competing governments backed by armed factions that four years earlier joined in an uprising that toppled autocrat Muammar Gaddafi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sees ascendant Islamists in Libya as a major security threat and is trying to secure the cooperation of tribal leaders to tackle it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Analysts say that Sisi would like Arab states to carry out a Yemen-type intervention in Libya to combat Islamic State jihadis and other radical factions that have taken advantage of the lawlessness to recruit and train in the vast desert country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri inaugurated the tribal conference, which runs through Thursday, by highlighting the positive role the tribes could play in restoring stability to Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Egypt had invited the tribal leaders to talks because they were the "backbone" of society and main guarantor of Libyan stability, security and territorial integrity, Shukri said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Egypt will not hesitate to support her brother Libyans until they achieve security and reconciliation among themselves," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But achieving consensus among the hundreds of tribal leaders on how to tackle Islamic extremism could be a long process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Libya's two governments depend on various tribes and militias to support their claims to power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The country's internationally recognised government, which Egypt backs, has operated out of eastern Libya since a rival armed faction called Libya Dawn seized the capital Tripoli in August and set up its own government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Analysts said most of the tribes in attendance in Cairo were known supporters of the internationally recognised government, with supporters of its Tripoli-based rival not well represented.</td></tr>
