<h3>Guinea says number of Ebola patients more than doubles since Feb</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The worst outbreak in history, which has killed more than 10,000 people in West Africa, appears to be on the wane, especially in Liberia where there are no current cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But there is still resistance to the anti-Ebola effort in Guinea, which is struggling to control the outbreak and has overtaken Sierra Leone as the main hub for transmission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dr Rafiou Diallo, a spokesman for Guinea's health ministry, said there were 91 suspected and confirmed Ebola patients in treatment centres compared with just 39 in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There is without doubt a spike in the number of cases, especially in Forecariah and Coyah (western Guinea). The explanation is there is still resistance that has not been overcome," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The number of Ebola cases in Guinea peaked in late December when there were nearly double current number of patients at 171, according to the World Health Organisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The current Ebola outbreak was first confirmed in Guinea's remote southeastern forest region last March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>From there, it spread across the country and into neighbouring states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Liberia and Sierra Leone were worst hit but Mali and Senegal also recorded cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Guinea's President Alpha Conde has set mid-April as the target for completely ending the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Officials in Guinea have previously said Ebola was under control, only to see the virus later spread further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Officials are calling this the fourth phase of the epidemic characterised by an increase in cases following the dip in January," Dr. Jean-Pierre Lamarque, regional health adviser for the French foreign ministry, said by telephone from Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The first phase was characterised by scattered cases in early 2014, followed by a spike in transmission in the forest region last summer and finally an ebbing in cases in early 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Unlike Liberia and Sierra Leone, the other two worst hit nations where U.S. and British military forces deployed to support the fight against Ebola, Guinea has not seen a large scale foreign military intervention.</td></tr>
