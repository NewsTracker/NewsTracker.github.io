<h3>Hillary Clinton to Outline Economic Policy on Monday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a speech intended to outline the economic vision she will present throughout her presidential campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday will call for an aggressive rethinking of domestic policy with the single purpose of lifting middle-class incomes that have stagnated for years despite the growth of the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mrs. Clinton will present a stark assessment of a middle class whose weekly earnings have virtually stalled for 15 years, and she will criticize "trickle down" Republican policies as having contributed to a vast concentration of wealth among the richest Americans, according to campaign aides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They offered a preview of the speech, to be delivered at the New School in New York, on the condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The emphasis on what economists have called "the great wage slowdown" of the 21st century is the result of Mrs. Clinton's months of conversations with more than 200 domestic policy experts and dozens of economists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She believes that increasing the wages of average Americans to reduce income inequality is the "defining economic challenge of our time," a campaign aide said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To that end, Mrs. Clinton will present proposals that include paid family medical leave, an increase in the federal minimum wage and incentives for corporations to increase profit-sharing programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She will also praise President Obama's proposals to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mrs. Clinton will highlight the economic record of the administration of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, when median family income, adjusted for inflation, increased to $56,080 in 1999 from $48,884 in 1993, according to census data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But she will also lay out a vision in contrast to Mr. Clinton's message of self-reliance and his assertion that the era of big government was over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mrs. Clinton will propose more investment in infrastructure, tax relief for small businesses, better access to child care, assistance to make college more affordable, stronger support for collective bargaining and tax increases on the wealthiest Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The economic team that advised Mrs. Clinton included the campaign policy advisers Jake Sullivan, Ann O'Leary and Maya Harris; Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and the policy director of Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign; and the former White House advisers Gene Sperling and Alan S. Blinder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The liberal economists Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics who has written extensively about inequality, and Alan B. Krueger, a co-author of "Inequality in America" and a professor at Princeton, also influenced Mrs. Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The campaign aides said Mrs. Clinton planned to use her address on Monday to present her overall assessment of the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She will delve more deeply into specifics, including her plans to change the tax code, regulate Wall Street and curb corporations' emphasis on short-term profits rather than long-term investment in employees, in a series of future speeches, they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It remains to be seen whether Mrs. Clinton's emphasis on wage growth to alleviate income inequality will be enough to appease a growing sense of anger over economic disparity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In a Gallup poll released in January, 67 percent of Americans said they were dissatisfied with the way income and wealth were distributed in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two of Mrs. Clinton's opponents for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, are trying to appeal to liberals concerned that Mrs. Clinton will not go far enough in addressing inequality and that her $200,000 paid speeches to Wall Street have made her overly cozy with the top 1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Is she willing to challenge the power of Wall Street and corporate bad actors whose actions threaten the economic well-being of millions of families?" asked Adam Green, president of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.</td></tr>
