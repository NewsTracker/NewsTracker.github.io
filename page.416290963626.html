<h3>Blatter says CONCACAF should get extra World Cup slot</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NASSAU, Bahamas (Reuters) - FIFA president Sepp Blatter's suggestion on Thursday that the CONCACAF region should be given an extra automatic qualification spot at the World Cup was met with a swift reply from UEFA president Michel Platini.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CONCACAF, the governing body for North and Central America and the Caribbean, currently has three automatic places in the World Cup finals with a fourth team able to qualify through a playoff against a nation from another confederation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Blatter, who is seeking a fifth term as president of FIFA, suggested it was time for a change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"If the World Cup will stay at 32 teams, then CONCACAF should have four teams," Blatter said to applause from delegates at the CONCACAF congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>For last year's World Cup in Brazil, Mexico qualified as the fourth team after beating New Zealand in a two-legged game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blatter is up against former Portugal international Luis Figo, Dutch Football Association chief Michael van Praag and Jordanian Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, in the May 29 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Both Van Praag and Figo have suggested expanding the size of the World Cup, with the Dutchman proposing a 40-team tournament and Figo a 48-nation event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Given FIFA politics, an attempt to give CONCACAF an extra place would likely be at the expense of Europe and Platini was quick to snap back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I want to say only one thing. If Blatter wants to give one more slot to a confederation that reaches one time the quarter-final, what will he give to us, who have (the last) three world champions?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Platini told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Germany won the tournament in 2014 after successes for Spain (2010) and Italy (2006).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>CONCACAF's Costa Rica reached the quarter-final in 2014 while the United States reached the last eight in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mexico were quarter-finalists in 1986 and 1970 - both times as hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>No team from CONCACAF has ever won the World Cup.</td></tr>
