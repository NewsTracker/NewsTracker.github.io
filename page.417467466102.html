<h3>Sepp Blatter Says He Will Resign as FIFA President</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sepp Blatter says he will resign as FIFA president amid corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter was re-elected last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He announced on Tuesday he is resigning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter will resign from soccer's governing body amid a widening corruption scandal and has promised to call for fresh elections to choose a successor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 79-year-old Blatter was re-elected to a fifth term on Friday, two days after a corruption crisis erupted and seven soccer officials were arrested in Zurich ahead of the FIFA congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This mandate does not seem to be supported by everybody in the world of football," Blatter said Tuesday at a hastily arranged news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"FIFA needs a profound restructuring."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Elections are expected to take place sometime between December and March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I will continue to exercise my function (until the new election)," said Blatter, who looked strained and serious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Three days earlier, Blatter was defiant and feisty in the same room when fending off questions about FIFA's battered reputation and the chance U.S. federal agencies could seek his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Blatter said he reached the decision after he had "thoroughly considered my presidency and ... the last 40 years in my life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Blatter joined FIFA in 1975 as technical director for development projects, was promoted to general secretary in 1981 and spent 17 years as right-hand man to Joao Havelange of Brazil before being elected to lead world soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The new election will be overseen by Domenico Scala, chairman of FIFA's audit and compliance committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Scala gave a statement immediately after Blatter in which he praised a decision that was "difficult and courageous in the current circumstances."</td></tr>
