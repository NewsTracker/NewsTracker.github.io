<h3>Greek stock exchange re-opens after five weeks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's stock exchange reopened today with a drop of more than 22% after a five-week shutdown imposed by the country's debt crisis and capital controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The main index fell over 22% and shares in the main Greek banks took a heavy blow at the opening with drops of around 30%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The exchange in Athens has been closed since the height of the country's financial crisis in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"But we must not get carried away. We must wait until the end of the week to see how the reopening will begin to be dealt with more coolly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The stock exchange operates as normal for foreign investors but local traders face limits on their transactions as part of the capital controls imposed by the government last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The restrictions mean that Greek investors are unable to finance the purchase of securities by taking money from their bank accounts in Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They will, however, be able to use foreign bank accounts or make cash transactions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The volatility cap has been reduced from 30% to 20% during the first three days of trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The country's lenders are in a vulnerable position because of outflows of billions of euros from deposits over the past six months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some 40bn has been withdrawn from Greek banks since December, according to the country's banks association, amid fears over the fate of the Greek economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The reopening of the stock market comes after senior EU and IMF auditors held their first meetings with Greek ministers to finalise a new three-year bailout for the country which could be worth up to 86bn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The last trading session on the Athens stock exchange was on 26 June, ending a few hours before Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced a referendum on the stringent bailout conditions demanded by Greece's international creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In response, worried Greeks rushed to withdraw cash from ATMs, prompting the government to impose capital controls from 29 June and announce the closure of the country's banks and the stock exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The banks reopened on 20 July but withdrawals and money transfers abroad remain restricted.</td></tr>
