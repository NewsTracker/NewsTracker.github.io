<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google Inc said it would pay its new chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, an annual base salary of US$650,000 and a special one-time $5 million sign-on bonus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company hired Morgan Stanley CFO Porat as its finance chief earlier this week, a sign it is aiming to rein in costs as it invests in new businesses such as self-driving cars and Internet-connected eyeglasses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Porat, who will join Google on May 26, will also get a new hire grant of $25 million through restricted stock units and a $40 million biennial grant in 2016, the company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google paid its outgoing CFO Patrick Pichette, who announced his retirement earlier this month, $62.2 million for the three years through 2013, more than twice the $29.6 million Porat earned at Morgan Stanley, according to regulatory filings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Porat earned a base salary of $1 million for 2013, according to Morgan Stanley's latest proxy filing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Her pay last year will be disclosed once the bank files its latest proxy.</td></tr>
