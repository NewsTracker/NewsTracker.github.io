<h3>The Latest: Beckham says FIFA scandal is infuriating</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>David Beckham says he has found it infuriating watching the FIFA scandal escalate over the last week and that it is time for soccer's governing body to change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The former England captain said: "Some of the things that we now know happened were despicable, unacceptable and awful for the game we love so much."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Beckham helped lobby for votes for England in 2010 ahead of the vote on the 2018 World Cup, which was awarded to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At the time, Beckham said he was left with a "sick feeling" after being misled by executive committee members who pledged their support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now Beckham hopes FIFA is cleaning up its act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Whilst it has not been good to read some of the headlines surrounding our sport recently, I hope at last we are now moving in the right direction," Beckham said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Football is not owned by a few individuals at the top, it belongs to the millions of people around the world who love this sport. It is time for FIFA to change and we should all welcome it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Swiss lawmakers have voted to weaken a bill meant to increase scrutiny of sports bodies such as FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The proposed law, known as 'Lex FIFA' but in the works long before soccer's governing body was hit by twin graft probes last week, is meant to make it easier for prosecutors to investigate corruption allegations at private organizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Switzerland's upper house narrowly voted Wednesday to approve an amendment requiring the organization itself to ask for the probe, except in cases where the public interest is at stake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Critics say this amendment is a hurdle for prosecutors seeking to bring a case, and hope it will be overturned by the lower chamber this fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Former Brazilian star player Ronaldo is calling for Marco Polo Del Nero, the president of the Brazilian Football Confederation, to step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Former CBF president Jose Maria Marin, who was replaced in April by Del Nero, is being held in a Swiss prison awaiting extradition to the United States on charges stemming for the FIFA corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's evident the kind of relationship he (Del Nero) had with Marin," Ronaldo said Wednesday in Sao Paulo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Therefore, it would be a good moment for him to resign."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ronaldo was named FIFA's best player three times and served as a so-called ambassador for FIFA's 2014 World Cup in Brazil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Romario, another former Brazilian star and now a federal senator, has also called for Del Nero to resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke says he sees "no reason" why he should resign amid claims he helped authorize $10 million in bribes for World Cup bidding votes.</td></tr>

<tr><td>32</td><td>The move comes after two former federation presidents, Nicolas Leoz and Eugenio Figueredo, were indicted in a bribery and money-laundering scheme in the FIFA investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Figueredo was arrested in Switzerland and Leoz is in Paraguay, where he has said he'll fight a U.S. extradition order.</td></tr>
