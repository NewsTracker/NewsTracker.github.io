<h3>'Community' is back in session &#239;&#191;&#189; this time on Yahoo Screen</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Typically, it was a metaphor for the show itself, which had struggled to survive throughout the years; "Save Greendale!" was the fifth season's hashtaggy theme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Also, the show was then on NBC, a television network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It returns to the world this week via Yahoo Screen, which is something you need the Internet to watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But unlike Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu Plus, it doesn't require a subscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>(It's free, people! Free!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apart from the venue and some changes in the cast, it is the "Community" you may know and maybe love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>(I am ardently fond of it myself.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That the series lasted as long as it did on broadcast TV does seem something of a miracle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was the last to premiere of a Thursday night group of self-aware ensemble comedies that also included "The Office," "30 Rock" and "Parks and Recreation" that were for a time all that NBC had going for it in the way of prestige.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mostly low-rated, they shared a golden moment when the geeks and the weirdos were allowed run of the school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"A show set in a community college," to steal a description of the show from the show itself, "Community" continues to achieve a tricky balance of cynicism, sentiment and surreality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Series commander Dan Harmon, who seems from afar to present an unusual mix of dishevelment and perfectionism, and who spent the fourth season fired from his own creation, maintains a firm hand on the wheel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As before, it stars Joel McHale, Gillian Jacobs, Dani Pudi, Alison Brie, Ken Jeong and Jim Rash as a collection of geeks and weirdos allowed run of the school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gone from the cast are Yvette Nicole Brown, who played Shirley, along with last year's recurring players John Oliver and Jonathan Banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>New regulars offset the loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Keith David (lately of "Enlisted") brings back the AARP demo that Chevy Chase once represented and, ethnically speaking, redresses the loss of Brown and the earlier loss of Donald Glover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As Jeong's Ben Chang asks early in the season premiere, "Have any of you white people noticed what's happened to this group? Do Abed and I need to be concerned?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Paget Brewster plays Frankie, a financial consultant assigned by Rash's Dean to work with the other characters' study group/committee room, to their near-unanimous disapproval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At first, she seems to come from a more conventional, well-organized reality - her even-tempered effect is something new for "Community" - but we will later see that this is not exactly the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"My umbrella concern is that you as a character represent the end of what I used to call 'our show,'" Abed (Pudi) tells her cautiously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This is the first I've heard that I'm a character on a show," says Frankie - who is, of course, a character on a show - and suggests that "Good shows change, I assume - personally, I don't own a TV."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Community" is not the first show to make a point of its own artifice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But something special does happen here; the show lives in consciousness of its own construction in a kind of existential but also dramatically meaningful way.</td></tr>

<h3>Will An Apple Web TV Service Be The Tipping Point For Cord Cutting?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple Apple is getting close to a web-only TV package that will offer roughly 25 channels and cost somewhere between $30 and $40 per month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This isn't the first time Apple had talked about offering some kind of TV service but with the momentum shifting to online viewing, it seems like there's a good chance this could be the real thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to the Journal, Apple's recent deal to offer a web-only version of HBO on its Apple TV box was "designed as a kind of appetizer for the main meal plans to be served later this year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new service would be anchored by the major networks except for NBC due to a dispute between Apple and NBC's corporate owner, Comcast Comcast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The news is an exciting one for cord-cutters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>By the end of this year there will be plenty of options for people who want to watch TV but don't want to pay for the huge suite of channels that come with a regular cable subscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dish Network is already offering Sling TV which, for $20 per month, gives viewers channels like ESPN ESPN HGTV and Cartoon Network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sony Sony is rolling out a web TV service that will be available via PlayStation consoles and networks like Nickelodeon, CBS and Showtime are rolling out web-only subscriptions services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Apple news comes close on the heals of Cablevision announcing that it will offer HBO's standalone service to its customers which means they'll be able to pay for HBO online without also committing to cable TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Until now, the cord cutting population has mostly been made up of Millennials who came of age watching TV on their laptops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While they are a desirable demographic, they actually weren't that large of a group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But with these recent announcements, it looks like cord cutting will soon become much more widespread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A lot of this is networks reacting to how people are watching TV anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rating for live television is down across the board as people are moving to time-shifted viewing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But until recently, networks didn't want to bite the hand that fed them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Networks earn plenty of money from the cable companies that carry their channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And those deals give them leverage to launch new channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>So, for example, Disney can threaten to hold back ESPN if a cable provider doesn't also take something like ESPN Classic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Now the momentum is definitely shifting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Even Cablevision sees the writing on the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It remains to be seen if this will all turn out to be a better deal for viewers though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While it feels good to only pay for the channels you want, cord cutting is going to add up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Say you end up paying $40 per month for Apple's TV service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There's no hint yet if that will include HBO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That might be another $15 per month on top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Then there's $9 per month for Netflix, $9 per month for Hulu Plus and $8.25 per month for Amazon Prime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Suddenly, you're paying $81.25 per month for TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That's not including what you pay for Internet service (and many people also get their phone service through their cable company in a triple play).</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Of course not everyone is going to want all of those services and some of them (like Netflix) you were probably paying for already.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But there's no question that the unbundled world is not going to come cheap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>If we do see a major shift away from cable, those service providers are going to start charging a lot more for Internet service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Not only will it become a much more important source of revenue but there will be much more information flying down those pipes as we watch more high-quality video online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Although companies like Google Google make a lot of noise about rolling out fast fiber, right now the cable companies don't have much competition when it comes to Internet service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>They'll be able to jack up prices and consumers will have few other options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Navigating all of the new services to create the perfect package of stations might have the opposite effect of pushing viewers back into cable's arms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>A one-price for everything deal might actually start to look pretty attractive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>It's Time To Cut The Cord.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Five Ways You'll Soon Be Able To Watch TV Without Cable.</td></tr>
