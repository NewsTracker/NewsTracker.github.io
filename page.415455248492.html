<h3>Jack Tame: Shooting the breeze at Starbucks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jet-lagged, sickly and more self-pitying than usual, I cut a pathetic silhouette across the mall car park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And then I went to Starbucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>I'm not a big fan of Starbucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I have no problem with business or money or corporate megabrands, I just really loathe homogeneous coffee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>America's chain store lionising leaves you with the same menu at every stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Capitalism hasn't created choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Right across the 50 states, it has created soul-withering conformity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I remember visiting the original Starbucks in Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There was a line out the door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Ah, people," I wanted to announce, "you know you can get exactly the same vente frappe at about a million other stores?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>So I decided to wallow in self-loathing with an oversized bucket of whatever they normally serve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Instead, I bought a flat white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That's right, Starbucks in America has our coffee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Of course, many Americans haven't heard of a flat white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Explaining our coffee is less fraught than explaining our sports teams ("flat white" draws noticeably fewer racial queries than "All Blacks"), but Starbucks' claim that its flat white "honours coffee artistry", must have had even its cheesiest marketing gurus spluttering into their crema.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I ordered a small flat white, which in America comes in a stein, and the guy behind me did the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>We struck up a conversation: he showed me his handgun and I noted the drink we'd both ordered is a staple of my home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"What's this thing taste like, anyway?" said the guy with the Glock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It's like a latte with more coffee," she replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>I bid farewell to gun guy and as I drew the searing-and-somewhat-bitter coffee to my lips, felt I'd done quite the national service by not bothering to correct anyone.</td></tr>

<h3>Restroom at an Indiana Wal-Mart closed indefinitely after backpack meth lab is found inside</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- A restroom at a Wal-Mart in eastern Indiana has been closed indefinitely after an employee discovered a working meth lab inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>State police say a Wal-Mart employee alerted police after seeing a man he described as suspicious enter the restroom about 11:30 p.m. Thursday with a backpack and leave without it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Star Press reports (http://bit.ly/18o9m0E ) that members of a state police meth suppression team removed the dangerous chemicals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Delaware County Health Department inspectors closed the restroom and a nearby women's restroom until they could be "decontaminated" by a professional cleaning company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>State police say people who make methamphetamine are leaving "the deadly explosive chemicals in public places to return later to get the finished product," rather than risk explosions and contamination at their own homes.</td></tr>
