<tr><td>3</td><td>Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi lays out the government's position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Although we understand the position of the Australian government, it should be underlined that this issue is purely a law enforcement issue," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"A law enforcement against an extraordinary crime. A law enforcement by a sovereign country, Indonesia," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The minister's comments follow a delay in the transfer of Australian citizens and convicted drug offenders Chan and Sukumaran to an Indonesian island for their execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Australians Andrew Chan, left, and Myuran Sukumaran in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ms Marsudi stressed the impartiality of the case from an Indonesian perspective.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Tony Spontana, spokesman for Attorney-General HM Prasetyo, on Tuesday admitted the Central Java island wasn't prepared to handle the execution of so many people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This week, I think we can't do the transfers because the isolation cells and other things are not ready," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But his comments were contradicted by a senior prison official, who told News Ltd the island was prepared for the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Lawyers for the Bali nine pair had been hoping for a break, as they ready to appear in court next Tuesday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>Barrister Julian McMahon welcomed the delay, however brief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It takes away a sense of urgency," he told reporters.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>He said it would take some time to renovate the cells to accommodate more prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"And at the same time, we can facilitate the Australian government and convicts' families' request to give more time for them together before they have to go to Nusakambangan."</td></tr>
