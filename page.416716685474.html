<h3>Nigerian women captured by Boko Haram 'stoned, starved' by militants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: A woman rescued from Boko Haram in Sambisa forest celebrates her freedom at a camp for Internally Displaced People in Yola, Adamawa State, Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nigeria's defence headquarters said on Sunday more than 260 women and children who were stranded after fleeing a Boko Haram attack had been located in Adamawa and returned to their communities in Madagali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The women have spoken to reporters for the first time about their ordeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They said Boko Haram fighters killed older boys and men in front of their families before taking women and children into the forest where many died of hunger and disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Nigerian army rescued hundreds of women and children last week from the Islamist fighters in northern Nigeria's Sambisa Forest in a major operation that has turned international attention to the plight of hostages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After days on the road in pickup trucks, hundreds were released on Sunday into the care of authorities at a government-run refugee camp in the eastern town of Yola, to be fed and treated for injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They didn't allow us to move an inch," said one of the freed women, Asabe Umaru, describing her captivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We thank God to be alive today. We thank the Nigerian army for saving our lives," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The army said more than 260 women and children were discovered by troops in Adamawa state and taken to a relief camp in Yola on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some had fled their homes during fighting while others had been abducted but managed to escape from the Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nearly 700 kidnap victims have been freed from the Islamist group's forest stronghold since Tuesday, with the latest group of 234 women and children liberated on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It is still unclear whether girls abducted from a boarding school in Chibok were among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"When we saw the soldiers we raised our hands and shouted for help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Boko Haram who were guarding us started stoning us so we would follow them to another hideout, but we refused because we were sure the soldiers would rescue us," Ms Umaru, a 24 year-old mother of two, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Photo: Women and children rescued from Islamist militant group Boko Haram in the Sambisa forest by the Nigerian military arrive at an internally displaced people's camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The prisoners suffered malnutrition and disease, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Every day we witnessed the death of one of us and waited for our turn."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Another freed captive, Cecilia Abel, said her husband and first son had been killed in her presence before the militia forced her and her remaining eight children into the forest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>For two weeks before the military arrived she had barely eaten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We were fed only ground dry maize in the afternoons. It was not good for human consumption," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Many of us that were captured died in Sambisa Forest. Even after our rescue, about 10 died on our way to this place."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Binta Abdullahi, who was kidnapped more than a year ago, described the hostages' ordeal as the soldiers moved in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"When the military stormed the camp where we were being held, our captors told us to take cover under trees and shrubs to avoid military shelling," the 18-year-old told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Some women who hid under trees were crushed by military tanks which mowed them down without knowing they were there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"After soldiers subdued Boko Haram fighters and rescued us they loaded those too weak or sick to trek into vehicles and asked the rest of us to walk behind... to avoid stepping on land mines planted by Boko Haram all over the place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"At least three women and some soldiers were killed when a mine exploded after a woman stepped on one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Ms Abdullahi said she was held in two places before being moved to Sambisa last month, including Boko Haram's "headquarters" in Gwoza, from where the Islamic State group affiliate declared a caliphate last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Her two sisters, who were also kidnapped, managed to escape but she stayed as she was looking after three children, aged four and three, whose mothers were not among those kidnapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Other former hostages spoke of forced labour, marriage, sexual and psychological abuse by their captors, as well as being compelled to fight on the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"They asked us to marry Boko Haram members but we told them there was no way we could get married because we were already married to our husbands," Abdullahi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"They said since we would not marry them they would sell us as slaves at the right time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Lami Musa, 19, was four months' pregnant when Boko Haram fighters stormed her village of Lassa, near Chibok, five months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>She said she was not married off because she was pregnant but was told she would be after she gave birth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Fortunately I was rescued a day after giving birth. I thank God," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The freed prisoners were fed bread and mugs of tea as soon as they arrived at the government camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Nineteen were in hospital for special attention, Dr Mohammed Aminu Suleiman of the Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The military said in a statement it had arrested a supplier of food and fuel to Boko Haram on Sunday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Amnesty International estimates the insurgents, who are intent on bringing western Africa under Islamist rule, have taken more than 2,000 women and girls captive since the start of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Photo: Mothers and relatives (pictured) of some of the more-than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls have pleaded for their safe return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The prisoners freed so far do not appear to include any of more than 200 schoolgirls snatched from school dormitories in Chibok town a year ago, an incident that drew global attention to the six-year-old insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Ms Umaru said her group of prisoners never came in contact with the missing Chibok girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Nigerian troops alongside armies from neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger have won back swathes of territory from the fighters in the last couple of months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Last year, the group exerted influence over an area bigger than Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>But a counter-attack launched in January has pushed them into Sambisa, a nature reserve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>While the Nigerian army is confident it has the group cornered, a final push to clear them from the area has been curtailed by landmines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>President Goodluck Jonathan, who relinquishes power later in May after his election defeat to Muhammadu Buhari, has promised to hand over a Nigeria "free of terrorist strongholds".</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Rampant corruption and a failure to stamp out the uprising in the north were factors that cost Jonathan the election won by Buhari, a former military ruler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram?</td></tr>
