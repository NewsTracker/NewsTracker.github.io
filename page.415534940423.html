<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP)?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Four more American aid workers arrived back in the United States on Tuesday from West Africa to be monitored for Ebola, health officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The latest arrivals bring to 15 the number of aid workers who have returned from Sierra Leone since Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>None of them have been diagnosed with Ebola, but they will be isolated and monitored during the next three weeks for signs of the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Officials have released few details, citing patient privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But all are connected to?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>or had direct physical contact with?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>another American who came down with Ebola last week in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The unidentified man is in critical condition at a National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>FILE - In this Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2014 file photo, a child stands near a sign advising of a quarantined home in an effort to combat the spread of the Ebola virus in Port Loko, Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Tuesday, March 17, 2015, health officials said four more medical aid workers have been flown from West Africa to the United States, for monitoring for Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The latest arrivals bring to 16 the number of aid workers evacuated in the last week from Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The other aid workers are staying near the Maryland hospital or hospitals in Atlanta and Omaha with special isolation units?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>in case they become sick, according to officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The sick American works with Partners in Health, a Boston-based international aid organization that has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Organization officials did not respond to calls and emails from The Associated Press on Monday or Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a statement Tuesday, co-founder Dr. Paul Farmer said the group is working with the CDC and others to investigate how the man was infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Ebola virus is spread through contact with a sick patient's blood or bodily fluids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The World Health Organization estimates the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Since last summer, several U.S. aid workers have gotten Ebola and have been flown back to the U.S. for care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A few other individuals have returned for monitoring; none got sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The aid workers who have returned since Friday are by far the largest group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>And more may be on their way later this week, CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The sick American worker was working at a government hospital in Port Loko in western Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But medical superintendent Dr. Peter George said the hospital hasn't had any Ebola cases for quite some time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He said it's likely the man also worked at a nearby Ebola treatment center, which George also manages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>George said a Partners in Health colleague told him the American passed out while at the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"At that time, nobody knew it was Ebola, so they assisted him," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Everyone who was working on the ward with the man is now being monitored, George said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He said that many of the foreigners working in Port Loko, including some of the Americans, live at the same tent camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He did not know if the sick health worker was living there.</td></tr>
