<h3>Russia's role in Ukraine seen shifting to training rebels</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"The general is very pleased," rebel battalion commander Ostap Cherny told his troops, referring to the figure in camouflage encircled by five armed guards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The man - almost certainly a Russian military officer - became alarmed when he saw two journalists approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His entourage shielded him from all sides, warning that photos were forbidden, and the group soon sped off in a four-car motorcade, with the "general" safely inside a black Toyota SUV with no license plates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nearly a year into the conflict in Ukraine, the extent of Moscow's direct involvement has become clear: They may wear camouflage, but the Russians' presence in eastern Ukraine is hardly invisible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the same time, there has been a recent shift in tactics that appears aimed at minimizing Russia's military presence as part of an effort to persuade the West to lift its punishing economic sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Visits by The Associated Press to training grounds like those near Yenakiyeve and interviews with dozens of rebels reveal that Russian armed forces spearheaded some of the major separatist offensives, then withdrew quickly before they could be widely noticed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>More recently, as a shaky cease-fire has taken hold, Russia has kept fewer troops in Ukraine but has increased its training of rebels to make sure they are capable of operating sophisticated Russian weaponry and defending the territory they control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>NATO and an independent London-based Russian scholar estimate that Russia has several hundred military trainers in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Since hostilities began around mid-April of last year, the Ukrainian government and the West have accused Moscow of waging an undeclared war in Ukraine by sending thousands of Russian troops to fight on the side of the separatists and providing the weapons to drive back the Ukrainian military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At least 6,000 people have been killed on both sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While the Kremlin acknowledges that many Russians have fought in Ukraine as volunteers, and such volunteers are regularly seen at checkpoints in rebel-held areas, Russia firmly denies sending its troops across the border or arming the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Throughout the conflict and often a few days before a new flashpoint of fighting would erupt, AP reporters would see as many as 80 armored vehicles a day, mostly coming from the direction of the Russian border, carrying troops and towing artillery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Their ultimate origin was impossible to establish, and the rebels strongly discouraged reporters from photographing such convoys or following them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While rebel commanders avoid talking to journalists about Russia's role in the conflict, separatist fighters routinely confirm that clothing and ammunition are among supplies they receive from Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Yes, our brothers are supplying us - you know who," one fighter who goes by the nom de guerre Taicha said in November at a checkpoint in the crossroads town of Krasny Luch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Most rebels won't reveal their full names for fear of retaliation against their families.</td></tr>
