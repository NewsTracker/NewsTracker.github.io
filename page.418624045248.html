<h3>Attorney for Germanwings victims says compensation too low</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (AP) - A German attorney representing some 30 families of victims of the March Germanwings plane crash says his clients are rejecting the airline's initial compensation offer as far too low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In an email, lawyer Elmar Giemulla said Saturday he had written Lufthansa, Germanwings' parent company, to say their offer of 25,000 euros ($27,200) compensation for each victim covered by German law and payments of 10,000 euros ($10,830) each to victims' immediate relatives "must be significantly raised."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He's asking Lufthansa for a "lower six-figure sum" in each category and for the airline to broaden how it defines "immediate relative."</td></tr>
