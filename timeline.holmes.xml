    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;- James Holmes will spend the rest of his life in prison after at least one juror balked at the possibility of sentencing him to death for the massacre that claimed 12 lives and spawned a gut-wrenching four-month trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine jurors wanted to execute Holmes, but one was steadfastly opposed and two others wavering, a juror told reporters after the verdict was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holmes' mother, Arlene, who had begged jurors to spare his life, leaned her head against her husband's shoulder and began sobbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the back, Aurora police officers who responded to the bloody scene of Holmes' attacks began crying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandy Phillips, whose daughter Jessica Ghawi was killed by Holmes, shook her head no and then held it in her hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashley Moser, whose 6-year-old daughter died in the attack and who was herself paralyzed by Holmes' bullets, also shook her head and then slowly leaned it against the wheelchair of another paralyzed victim, Caleb Medley.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
