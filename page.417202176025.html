<h3>Too many Rohingya to settle: Morrison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Social services minister Scott Morrison says people who suggest countries in the region can resettle persecuted Rohingya misunderstand the scale of the problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Thousands of boat people are stranded on boats in camps and at sea in South East Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The crisis comes amid reports that Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has been told by Indonesian officials that only around 30-40 per cent are Rohingya refugees and the rest are illegal workers from Bangladesh seeking jobs in Malaysia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Morrison says he wasn't privy to the reported discussion and can't confirm the reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Morrison says he has visited Rohingya displacement camps and the issue is more complex than advocates made out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There's a million Rohingya in Myanmar. The suggestion that somehow resettlement is the answer to that issue, I think completely misunderstands what is happening in that part of the world," he said in Sydney on Saturday.</td></tr>
