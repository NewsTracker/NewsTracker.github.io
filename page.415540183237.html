<h3>Clinton criticizes House GOP budget plan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton blasted a budget proposal released by Republicans on Tuesday, saying on Twitter it "fails Americans" on investments in jobs and economic growth, would cut college aid for students and undermine President Barack Obama's health care law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the second straight day that the former secretary of state turned to social media to criticize Congress, a tactic used extensively by President Barack Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Budgets reflect our priorities. They should help families get ahead, educate our kids, and spark small business growth," Clinton said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She said the "nation's future - jobs & economic growth - depends on investments made today. The GOP budget fails Americans on these principles."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton's Twitter response came hours after Republicans released a $3.8 trillion budget plan in the House that would overhaul the tax code and aims to balance the budget in a decade in tandem with deep cuts in social programs and the repeal of Obama's health care law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The White House said the proposal failed to make investments in education, infrastructure and national defense, setting up a likely budget clash in the months before the next presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton faulted the budget proposal's outlook for education, saying cuts to Pell Grants "hold our kids back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She also warned against another attempt to repeal the health care law, saying it would "let insurers write their own rules again, and wipe out coverage for 16 million Americans."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clinton, who has faced criticism in recent weeks over revelations that she used a private email account at the State Department, has sought to present herself as an above-the-political-fray figure who would overcome Washington gridlock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But she has also ratcheted up criticism of Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Monday, she blasted Senate Republicans for holding up confirmation of Loretta Lynch, Obama's choice to be Attorney General, until the Senate completed a human trafficking bill that was complicated by a provision related to funding for abortions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton called it a "Congressional trifecta against women."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Her approach offers parallels to Democrats' attempt to tarnish 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney with the budget plan that included sharp cuts to social programs developed by Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Paul Ryan, who later became Romney's running mate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It comes as Clinton is formulating policies that will form the foundation of her pitch to Americans, chief among them how to boost wages and create more economic opportunities for Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's a very central part not just of 2015, but 2016: What are the ideas and investments we're going to make to give Americans more economic opportunity," said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.</td></tr>

<h3>Habitually tardy de Blasio late on St. Patrick's Day</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>De Blasio arrived at the 8:30 a.m. St. Patrick's Day Mass at the cathedral 15 minutes late on Tuesday - his second St. Pat's snafu this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Timothy Cardinal Dolan, who was officiating, noticed the mayor's absence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the beginning, Dolan rattled off a list of dignitaries present, including many pols from Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He did not name de Blasio, whose seat in the front pew was vacant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Later, after de Blasio had arrived, Dolan made a point of noting his presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Mayor de Blasio, we're happy you're here," Dolan said warmly from the pulpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>De Blasio - who infuriated Rockaways residents two weeks ago when he arrived 30 minutes late for their St. Pat's Parade - got off to a late start Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was supposed to kick off the holiday breakfast at Gracie Mansion at 7:45 a.m., according to his schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His rep said he was at the party, which began at 7:30 a.m., but in a side room with Irish dignitaries and other VIPs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The festivities, which included a city proclamation for former Daily News Editor-in-Chief Pete Hamill, didn't finish until 8:30 a.m - when Mass was starting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At a press conference in Harlem later Tuesday, de Blasio was asked about his late arrival to the Mass, which honors St. Patrick as the patron saint of the Archdiocese of New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>De Blasio mentioned that Hamill spoke "very, very powerfully."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Everyone in the room was really moved by what he said ... and for a variety of reasons, the program went a little long," de Blasio said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hamill spoke for about eight minutes in the 30-minute ceremony, which included speeches from de Blasio and Brian O'Dwyer, a lawyer who is a powerful voice among the city's Irish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The moral of the story is we're going to start the breakfast even earlier next year, because that's a little bit of a tight time frame," said de Blasio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We have to do better next year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Asked about his own late arrival to the main Gracie party, de Blasio said, "The program went right as we wished it to go."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His St. Patrick's Day troubles come on the heels of de Blasio's struggles with the city's Irish community, a dwindling but vocal ethnic bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>O'Dwyer later said many Irish-American New Yorkers are critical of de Blasio's efforts to ban the horse and carriage industry - which employs many Irish - and his decision not to march in the St. Pat's Parade on Fifth Ave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>because it is not sufficiently inclusive of the gay community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But O'Dwyer also said that the Irish appreciate his work on immigration and boosting funding for the Irish Arts Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"To be fair, the mayor is trying very hard," said O'Dwyer.</td></tr>
