<h3>Husband of Facebook COO Dies</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dave Goldberg, the husband of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, died Friday night, according to a Facebook post from Goldberg's brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Robert Goldberg wrote on Facebook: "It's with incredible shock and sadness that I'm letting our friends and family know that my amazing brother, Dave Goldberg, beloved husband of Sheryl Sandberg, father of two wonderful children, and son of Paula Goldberg, passed away suddenly last night. In this time of sorrow, we mourn his passing and remember what an amazing husband, father, brother, son and friend he was. No words can express the depth of loss we feel, but we want his children to learn how much he meant to all of you. In lieu of donations, we want to celebrate his life in a manner that respects the family's privacy as they cope with this tragic, life changing event: Sheryl, their children, and our family would be grateful if people would post their memories and pictures of Dave to his Facebook profile."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dave Goldberg was an amazing person and I am glad I got to know him.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>According to Goldberg's LinkedIn page, he was the CEO of Survey Monkey since 2009.</td></tr>
