<h3>Zac Blair goes through 4 tours to earn his PGA card</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - Few other PGA Tour rookies are more seasoned than Zac Blair, who reached the big leagues after a journey that took him from one end of the Americas to the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"My dad has always ingrained in me that if you're good enough, you'll get a shot somewhere and take advantage of it," Blair said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It was a sweet route I took, but a little unpredictable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That route took the 24-year-old from Utah to the PGA Tour Latin America, the PGA Tour Canada, the Web.com Tour and the PGA Tour in a span of six months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He also played on the Australasian Tour last year, though that was after he had his card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And he tied for 40th in the U.S. Open, where he had his father come inside the ropes to carry his bag up the 72nd hole at Pinehurst No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If there's a message Blair has for college kids, it would be to go through Q-school in the fall (even as an amateur) to try to get some status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He made it through four stages, including pre-qualifying, and earned conditional Web.com Tour status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That wasn't enough to persuade him to turn pro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was planning to play amateur golf for seasoning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But then he saw players he beat at Q-school competing in Latin America, and decided to give it a try.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Blair had three top 10s before Latin America took its summer break, and his plan was to return and try to finish high enough on the money list to get a Web.com Tour card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Then he qualified in Oregon for the U.S. Open and, with the PGA Tour Canada in nearby Vancouver, went there and missed the cut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The big break was in Nova Scotia on the Web.com Tour, where his conditional status made him the 40th alternate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It wasn't even on my mind," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He tied for seventh in Nova Scotia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He tied for 11th in Utah - he already had an exemption to his home state event - but that got him to the next stop, and he tied for 25th in Boise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>With that, he had full status the rest of the way, and he reached the Web.com Tour Finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Blair promptly made three straight cuts, and then was runner-up in the finale to earn his PGA Tour card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And in his first start, he played in the last group at the Frys.com Open and tied for 12th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He also has a tie for sixth in the Sony Open and a tie for 11th at Torrey Pines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But what a journey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It was different," he said of the first leg of his trip to Latin America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"It's not like you're getting in a car and going out to eat. You're by yourself. It was good. I learned a lot and it helped me grow up and mature. At that point, it was the best thing I've done."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Right up there with graduating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There was one class he worried about failing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Blair was in the Dominican Republican when his academic adviser called to say he graduated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Which is better - getting a PGA Tour card or getting a college diploma?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"They're both pretty good," he said with a smile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I would recommend it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>GRAND SLAM: Donald Trump spoke last week about "major news" involving one of his golf courses, and he was right about one thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It's a tournament only for major champions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The PGA of America announced Tuesday that Trump National Golf Club-Los Angeles will host the PGA Grand Slam of Golf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The 36-hole exhibition is for the four major champions of the year, or past major champions as an alternate if someone doesn't play or there is a multiple major champion in 2015.</td></tr>

<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu claims 'worldwide' effort to defeat Likud as Israeli election looms</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told supporters there is "a tremendous effort, worldwide, to topple" him as Israelis head to the polls next week, according to an Army Radio broadcast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Little context was provided for the 12-second clip of Mr Netanyahu, speaking to activists in his Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it came after weeks in which his supporters have accused US President Barack Obama of meddling in Israeli politics because a top strategist from Mr Obama's campaigns is advising a Tel Aviv group whose goal is to replace the current government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu campaigns for re-election in the coastal city of Netanya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The strategist, Jeremy Bird, an architect of the grassroots and online organising effort that propelled Mr Obama into the White House, is consulting with the group, V15, which helped bring 35,000 people to an anti-Netanyahu rally at the weekend in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Netanyahu, in turn, has been criticised in Israel and abroad for interfering in American politics by speaking about the Iranian nuclear program last week in the US Congress at the invitation of the Speaker of the House, a Republican, and against the wishes of the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Prime Minister said during a visit to an Israeli military headquarters in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday that since that speech, "I get the impression that there are more and more voices, especially in the US but also in other places, that support Israel's position".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, co-leaders of the centrist Zionist Union, outline their party's election platform in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A week before the elections, polls show the rightist Likud neck and neck with the centre-left Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both camps are vying to pull votes from smaller parties and win over an unusually large pool of voters who remain undecided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The battle is very close, nothing is guaranteed", Mr Netanyahu told his party activists on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It is not guaranteed because there is a tremendous effort, worldwide, to topple the Likud government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rafi Smith, a leading Israeli pollster, said on Tuesday that the dynamics of the campaign had shifted in recent weeks and a growing margin of voters were calling for change even as the largest group viewed Mr Netanyahu as best suited for the top job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market while on the campaign trail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>By creating the Zionist Union, Mr Smith told a group of international journalists, Isaac Herzog of the Labor Party and Tzipi Livni of the small Hatnua faction "changed the atmosphere" from the last election in 2013, when Mr Netanyahu's re-election was never in doubt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The main difference in this election is that we're actually asking who is going to be prime minister of Israel," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"In 2013, that was not the question. It was who was going to join Netanyahu in the coalition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Netanyahu made a rare, unpublicised campaign stop on Monday at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A giant rotating campaign billboard features an image of Benjamin Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Tuesday, he gave a 35-minute interview to a small radio and television station in which he spoke mainly about Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In a sign of Mr Herzog's growing strength, Mr Netanyahu focused his attacks on Ms Livni, who is less popular, and who, under the Zionist Union agreement, would rotate the premiership with Mr Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Anyone who stays home is ensuring that Tzipi Livni, who is a candidate for prime minister, will be prime minister," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He also dismissed talk of uniting in a coalition with Zionist Union, which he said "contains activist elements that can only be called anti-Zionist".</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Great God almighty, how can two such pieces be glued together: the Likud, which is such a national, liberal, Zionist movement, with such elements?" he asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Such a government would fall apart before it is formed. There are two options: either a paralysis government or worse, Tzipi Livni living on Balfour Street and running the country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Herzog provided the response, saying on Israel Radio's noon magazine that "Netanyahu is feeling pressured" and "shooting in all directions, making false accusations".</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Zionist Union has hardly mentioned the rotation agreement with Ms Livni since its formation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mr Herzog kept the focus on himself on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"I will replace him and I will form the next government," Mr Herzog said on the radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>At his own campaign event on Monday evening in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva, Mr Herzog more frequently used the plural pronoun "we", referring not just to Ms Livni but to the designated candidates to lead the defence and finance ministries, who joined him on stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We're the only alternative to the regime", he told a group of about 150 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We have answers that are complete and to the point. We will do everything to unite the nation and not break it up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>As he has throughout the campaign, Mr Herzog declined to answer a voter's question of whether he would consider a unity government with the Likud, explaining that he had learnt in politics "never to say no in advance".</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"I want to make it clear: I'm here to beat Netanyahu and send him home," Mr Herzog said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"If we are big enough," he added in an attempt to pull people away from other centre-left parties, "then we'll be able to put together a normal coalition."</td></tr>
