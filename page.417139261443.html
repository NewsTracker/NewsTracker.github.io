<h3>Tunisia museum attack suspect arrested in Italy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Moroccan citizen Touil Abdelmajid, a suspect in the Bardo Museum attack in Tunisia, is seen in an undated handout photograph released by Italian police in Milan, May 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ROME -- Italian police have arrested a Moroccan man on a Tunisian arrest warrant accusing him of helping organize and execute the March 18 attack on Tunisia's Bardo museum that left 22 people dead, authorities said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Touil Abdelmajid was arrested Tuesday evening at the home of his mother in Gaggiano, near Milan, anti-terrorism investigator Bruno Megale told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The accusations listed in the Tunisian arrest warrant include premeditated murder, conspiracy to commit attacks against the internal security of the state, belonging to a terrorist group and recruiting and training others to commit terrorist attacks, Megale said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He was wanted internationally for co-participation in, planning and executing the March 18 attack on the Bardo museum in Tunis," Megale said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility for attacking the Bardo, Tunisia's leading historical museum, which has a trove of Roman mosaics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gunmen opened fire on tourists getting out of buses and then entered the museum, apparently unimpeded, and fired on more tourists inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Two gunmen were killed in a shootout with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Four Italians were among the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A number of people have been arrested in connection with the attack, but the Tunisian Interior Ministry has said the mastermind of the attack is still at large.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Megale said Abdelmajid had been unknown to Italian authorities except for an expulsion order issued by Sicilian authorities in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Police were able to identify him in part after his mother reported that her son's passport was missing immediately after the Bardo attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The February expulsion order led to another major worry for Italy; how Abdelmajid came to be in the country in they first place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Police said Wednesday that the Moroccan arrived in Italy aboard a migrant boat a month before the attack and was ordered expelled, but it's not clear how or if he ever left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Megale said only that Abdelmajid was identified in Porto Empedocle, Sicily, on Feb. 17 and was issued an expulsion order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The news fueled criticism of Italy's migrant rescue operations by anti-immigrant politicians, who have warned that Islamic extremists could slip into Italy among the thousands of would-be refugees fleeing Libya aboard smugglers' boats.</td></tr>
