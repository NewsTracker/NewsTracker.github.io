<h3>British military bases in Cyprus are failing to stop illegal traps for migrating songbirds</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>More than two million migratory birds were deliberately killed in Cyprus last autumn, according to new data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The birds, which cost 80 euros ( 86) for a dozen, are a local delicacy known as ambelopoulia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The illegal activity has now caused a drastic drop in the numbers of blackcaps, robins and songbirds and has been dubbed 'out of control'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), a partner of Birdlife Cyprus, described the issue as 'trapping on an industrial level'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said: 'We are hoping that we can begin to get a grip and would like the British base of Dhekelia to help clear the acacia, which trappers plant to lure in birds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'It is so obvious when it is taking place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It is easy to detect and easy to see where it has been planted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>We accept it is a difficult job but we would like to see some commitment to a timetable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'Unfortunately last year the action the British military took was too late because it was after the trapping season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'At the moment the Ministry of Defence are arguing with our figures but everybody needs to work together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The birds are caught by trappers using netting or limesticks - twigs covered in sticky lime or glue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nearly ten miles of net supports and more than 6,000 limesticks were discovered between September and October last year, according to Birdlife Cyprus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Trappers, who like to use the area around Dhekelia, also play birdsong through loudspeakers hidden in the bushes to lure more in and throw gravel to force birds towards their nets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nearly 4,000 poachers are believed to be involved in the autumn trapping season - much higher than in summer because the birds are plumper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clairie Papazoglou, Birdlife Cyprus' chief, said poaching was a 'serious, persistent and growing problem'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She added that it 'has been the worst year with the highest trapping levels since the start of the monitoring programme in 2002'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Birdlife Cyprus has also called for tougher sentencing but admitted attitudes towards killing and eating migratory birds would have to change to make a difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Poachers that are caught can currently receive penalties of up to three years in jail and fines as high as 17,000 euros ( 12,215).</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: 'We do not accept the report's unverified claims about loss of bird life during this period, which was based upon data collected from a very short period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'We are committed to tackling poaching which is why we arrested nearly 50 poachers and seized 450 nets and 286 piece of poaching equipment during the last migration period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>When we catch poachers we can fine them 17,000, or send them to prison for up to 3 years.</td></tr>
