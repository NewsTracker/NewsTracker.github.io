<h3>Growing fear in Russia leaves opposition in despair after murder of Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Moscow: The murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was the last straw for Dmitry Ostashenko, who decided to give up his life as a logistics manager in Moscow and try to leave Russia with his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We can't live here any more," Mr Ostashenko, 31, an opposition activist like his wife, Inna Malashenko, said at the Sunday march to commemorate Mr Nemtsov, carrying a sign that said "I'm Not Afraid".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ms Malashenko, 24, said: "We've tried to influence things but we see that we can't."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Zhanna, a daughter of murdered Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, farewells her father in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russia's liberal opposition is in despair after the Friday night slaying of Mr Nemtsov in the Kremlin's shadow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While the murder elicited international condemnation and sparked the largest opposition gathering since the protests of 2011 and 2012 against President Vladimir Putin's rule, rank-and-file activists say the Russian leader looks stronger than ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Putin gained from a peace agreement that helped curb fighting in Ukraine, easing international pressure as well as the threat of new sanctions on the ailing Russian economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Candles glow as people gather for a memorial service before the funeral of slain opposition figure Boris Nemtsov in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At home, Mr Nemtsov's assassination sent a chill down the spines of critics both inside and outside the ruling elite, said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin political adviser who was sent to Ukraine by Mr Putin to help manage Viktor Yanukovych's presidential campaign in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There's a sense of fear across the board," said Mr Pavlovsky, who advised the Kremlin during Mr Putin's first two terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This will make people more loyal and obedient."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While Mr Putin vowed to find the culprits, the suspicion remains that the murderers were confident of implicit support from the authorities, Mr Pavlovsky said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Members of the Nemtsov family embrace as people bring flowers to the grave of the slain Russian opposition figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Nemtsov, 55, was preparing to to publish information about Russia's role in the Ukrainian crisis, allies said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The liberal opposition has been struggling to gain traction against the backdrop of the nationalistic fervour whipped up by the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, near-record approval for Mr Putin and government persecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Of the movement's leaders, Alexey Navalny is serving a 15-day jail sentence for handing out pamphlets and Mikhail Khodorkovsky is in self-exile after a decade in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Putin, 62, has cracked down on political foes since he was first elected in 2000, stamping out opposing voices in parliament and tightening the state's control over media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He stepped up regulations on the internet and non-government organisations after the protests three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The pressure increased as the Ukrainian crisis deepened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>State television and pro-Kremlin rallies branded anti-Putin activists agents of foreign interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Nemtsov's allies blamed the government for creating an climate that led to the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>For Mr Ostashenko and Ms Malashenko, who worked on Mr Navalny's failed campaign for Moscow mayor in 2013, that adds up to overwhelming odds for Mr Putin, considering that the opposition candidate got 27 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The fact that 70 per cent of people in Moscow support Putin devitalises and demoralises us," Ms Malashenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The drive is also gone for Alexandra Borisova, 24, a volunteer observer in the 2011 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>While as many as 50,000 people turned out for Sunday's march, they were just "a drop in the ocean" in a city of more than 11 million, Ms Borisova, a computer programmer, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Even without the state propaganda, the attitude to Mr Nemtsov was negative," she said, waiting with a bouquet of orange roses to file past Mr Nemtsov's casket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"In Russia, they don't love liberals."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mr Putin's popularity remains near record levels at 86 per cent, the Levada polling company figures show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In another survey, it shows the number of people who say they have no sympathy for the opposition rising to 68 per cent from 59 per cent three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The opposition was counting on the economic crisis to spark a revolt on the scale of the 2011-2012 protests, the largest since the end of communism 20 years earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister who led the memorial march, vowed to pursue efforts to unseat Mr Putin and focused on democratic values, rather than the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We'll continue the fight for Russia to become a normal democratic country, where human rights and political freedoms are our highest values," he said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Russia's stabilising economy helps solidify Mr Putin's position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The notion of a palace coup by disgruntled allies, floated by some in the opposition including Mr Navalny, was less likely than ever, said Mr Pavlovsky, the former Kremlin adviser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>That leaves even those who feel too old to emigrate with tough choices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Igor Petrenko, 49, said he had encouraged his three adult children to get jobs abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>While he considered opposition rallies a waste of time, Mr Petrenko said he came along to protest Mr Nemtsov's death out of a sense of duty.</td></tr>
