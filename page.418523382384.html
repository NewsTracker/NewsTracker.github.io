<h3>Greece pledges to get rid of tax evasion as a way of life</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The experts say Greece has largely failed in previous crackdowns on tax evasion, which has been rampant for generations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An estimated euro10 billion in taxes never makes it into government coffers annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Dimitris Bokas keeps meticulous records of the bathroom fixtures he sells from his small shop in the quiet middle-class residential neighborhood of Koukaki near the center of Athens - just in case a tax inspector makes a surprise visit to ensure Greece's 23 percent sales tax is being collected and reported correctly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Bokas also does installation and repair jobs - and half of those involve cash deals with no receipts for his labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The result is that a job costing 250 euros ($275) goes for 125 euros because he doesn't charge the client sales tax and Bokas doesn't report the income for taxation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I've got a receipt for everything I sell in my shop," Bokas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But tax officials "don't know what my hands do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This kind of tax dodging is a Greek national pastime, costing the state billions of euros in revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece promised last week to get tough on tax evasion in return for a third European bailout expected to be negotiated over the next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The talks, expected to last four weeks, will start if Parliament agrees by Wednesday to eurozone demands including tax hikes and pension cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An estimated 10 billion euros in taxes never makes it into government coffers annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tax dodging among Greeks started as a sign of patriotism during nearly four centuries of Ottoman rule that ended in 1821.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It continues today amid mistrust over government spending and disdain over how the country's various administrations have handled Greece's financial mess after the economy imploded in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"A lot of Greeks believe it's not only a way to cheat the inefficient Greek government, but a way to exert small time resistance to the bailout agreement and tax hikes," said Aristidis Hatzis, a professor of law and economics at Athens University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They do not perceive this as a kind of corruption."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Contributing to the problem is an informal economy that accounts for about 25 percent of Greece's annual gross domestic product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Evasion is most common in the services sector where customers don't receive a physical product, and it's not limited to small businesses like plumbers and restaurants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In monthly reports, Greece's financial crimes unit lists finalized tax investigation cases and recent offenders include doctors, engineers, high tech firms, construction companies, clothing manufacturers, bakeries, architects and advertising agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Many cases involve unreported income of hundreds of thousands of euros or more and one lawyer failed to report 16 million euros in income, the unit said in a statement last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But many cases go uninvestigated because of poorly trained tax investigators, personnel shortages and politically motivated appointments of tax investigation supervisors, said Haris Theoharis, who was Greece's top tax enforcer until last year and is now a lawmaker with the centrist To Potami party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Theoharis said it's too soon to tell whether the governing far left Syriza party will mount an effective campaign against tax evasion because few specifics of its plans have been disclosed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He argued that freeing the system from political interference is key: "Unless they depoliticize the tax administration and stop trying to interfere with who gets promoted," he said, "they will not have success."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Nikolaos Artavanis, a finance professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said the government's decision to raise the sales tax for restaurants as part of its offer in return for a bailout could prevent a tax evasion crackdown from working.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>After Greek Bailout Deal, What's Next?</td></tr>
