<h3>Iraqi Kurds say Islamic State used chlorine gas against them</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The security council of the semi-autonomous Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) said that its soldiers had taken soil and clothing samples after an IS car bombing attempt on January 23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It said laboratory analysis showed "the samples contained levels of chlorine that suggested the substance was used in weaponised form".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The allegation could not be independently confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Chlorine's use as a chemical weapon dates back to World War I. It is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits all use of toxic agents on the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Peter Sawczak, spokesman for the Dutch-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said: "We have not had a request from Iraq to investigate claims of use of chemical weapons in Iraq, and the OPCW cannot immediately verify the claims."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chlorine has been used "systematically" in the civil war in neighbouring Syria, an OPCW fact-finding mission found last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The OPCW would have to get its own samples to confirm the use of chemical weapons in a member state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The KRG statement said the car bombing attempt happened on a highway between Mosul and the Syrian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Kurdish security source said that Kurdish fighters fired a rocket at the car carrying the bomb so there were no casualties, except for the suicide bomber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>About a dozen Kurdish fighters experienced symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dizziness or weakness, the source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The statement said the analysis was carried out in a European Union-certified laboratory after the soil and samples were sent by the KRG to a "partner nation" in the US-led coalition that is fighting IS militants in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The source described the samples as "leftovers from the suicide bomber", but declined to identify the laboratory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The White House said in a statement it could not confirm the allegations but found them "deeply disturbing" and was monitoring the situation "very closely".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A US defence official said the use of chlorine as a weapon was a possible sign of "growing desperation".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>IS militants have increased their attacks to capture Ramadi, the capital of western Anbar province, since pro-government forces began a military operation to retake the city of Tikrit in Salahuddin province, said Faleh al-Issawi, deputy chief of the Anbar provincial council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The group has hit Ramadi with 150 mortar shells and attacked security forces with 23 car bombings - including one in which Australian teenager Jake Bilardi was reputedly killed - since Wednesday, Mr Issawi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said IS had employed a new tactic, digging tunnels over a kilometre long and detonating bombs underneath Iraqi army headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Twenty-five soldiers died on Wednesday, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Army headquarters were attacked again on Saturday with two car bombs, he said, and the city's defences are collapsing under the strain of the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>US Central Command said on January 30 that an Islamic State chemical weapons expert had been killed in a coalition air strike six days earlier near Mosul - the day after the car bombing cited in Saturday's statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The expert, known as Abu Malik, had been a chemical weapons engineer during the rule of Saddam Hussein and then affiliated himself with al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2005, Central Command said at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>When he joined IS, it gave the insurgent force a chemical weapons capability, it added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Kurdish authorities said in their statement they had "long suspected that [IS] fighters have been using chemical agents" and cited video footage from recent battles around the city of Tikrit between the militants and Iraqi troops and allied Shiite militias where "plumes of orange smoke" were visible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Reuters was also emailed video footage and photos of what the KRG's security council identified as images from the January 23 attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Among the photos were several canisters lying on the ground that the council says were found at the site and contained chlorine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Iraq's Kurds were the victims of the deadliest chemical attack of modern times when Saddam Hussein's air force bombed the town of Halabja in 1988, gassing at least 5000 people to death.</td></tr>
