<h3>Security concerns delay reopening of Tunisia national museum</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tunisia's national museum on Tuesday delayed a planned reopening after last week's attack on foreign tourists due to security concerns, its head of communications Hanene Srarfi told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have been surprised at the last minute, but the interior ministry says that for security reasons we cannot receive a large number of visitors," she said, adding that an official ceremony marking the reopening of the museum would still go ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Officials at the Bardo Museum had planned to allow the public back in on Tuesday, six days after an attack claimed by the Islamic State group killed 21 people.</td></tr>
