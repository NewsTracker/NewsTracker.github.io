<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Some leaders accused the Israeli prime minister of exploiting terror attacks to boost his chances in an upcoming election.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>"The place for French Jews is France."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Following dual terror attacks in Copenhagen that included the fatal shooting of a man guarding a synagogue during a bat mitzvah, Netanyahu suggested on Sunday that European Jews move to Israel for safety.</td></tr>
