<h3>Militant group al-Shabab threatens more attacks on Kenya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Kenyan cities will run red with blood," al-Shabab said, reported the SITE intelligence monitoring group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>President Uhuru Kenyatta was defiant when he addressed the nation in response to the attacks and al-Shabab's statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We will fight terrorism to the end," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I guarantee that my administration shall respond in the fiercest way possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Kenyan official said that five people suspected of involvement in the massacre had been arrested and that the government was pursuing other suspects, including Mohamed Mohamud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mohamud is a former teacher at a Kenyan madrassa, or Islamic school, and the alleged mastermind of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We will bring all of them to justice", Mr Kenyatta said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are also in active pursuit of the mastermind and have placed a reward for his capture," he said of the $US220,000 ($288,000) offered for information leading to Mohamud's arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said, in a Twitter post, that three people trying to cross into Somalia were arrested by Kenyan security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Two other suspects were arrested at the Garissa University College campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Thursday's assault on the university is the worst terrorist attack in Kenya since the bombing of the US Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, which killed 224 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An attack on the upscale Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in September 2013 left 67 dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Many Garissa residents channelled their emotions by turning out in the traffic-clogged streets on Saturday to view the bodies of four men alleged to have taken part in the assault, even as Somali militants issued a statement threatening Kenya with more attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some wanted desperately to verify that the attackers weren't their countrymen, others wanted to see if they recognised a face, and still others wanted to see that those capable of such brutal acts had experienced some vague form of justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I want to see them," Muna Haji said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I want to know that these people are dead. They have killed innocent people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The four naked bodies were loaded haphazardly into the back of a pick-up truck at the morgue where they had been held since morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Local and international forensics teams had taken their clothes as evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The truck paraded the bodies through town as residents ran alongside, clamouring for a glimpse, until it arrived at Garissa Primary School, where about 2000 people had gathered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>There, it parked, and the bodies sat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Flies gathered on the bloated limbs hanging from the truck bed as the crowd swelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Are those the real terrorists? During Westgate, we never found out whether the terrorists were really killed," said Abdihakim Mowlio, an intern at Garissa Provincial General Hospital, referring to the deadly Westgate mall attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"If they show the dead bodies, we believe that they've really been killed. We'll feel safer because we've seen that the government has actually responded."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As it had with its previous assaults in Kenya, which have claimed the lives of more than 200 Kenyans in the past two years, al-Shabab said the attacks were in retaliation for Kenya's 2011 invasion of Somalia and its continued presence in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The invasion - called Operation Linda Nchi - was allegedly in response to the kidnapping of Westerners in north-east Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Since October 2011, Kenya has been the most insecure that we have seen in decades. If going into Somalia was to secure Kenya, then they have failed," said Abdullahi Halakhe, a Horn of Africa analyst with Amnesty International.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"The elephant in the room is what is Kenya's plan as far as Somalia is concerned? What does the exit plan look like? Is it two years, is it three years?"</td></tr>
