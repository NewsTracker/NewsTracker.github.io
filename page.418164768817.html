<h3>Falling energy prices prompt modest fall in eurozone inflation to 0.2 percent in May</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS - Official figures show that inflation across the 19-country eurozone eased in the year to June to 0.2 percent from 0.3 percent the month before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, says Tuesday the fall in inflation was primarily due to a 5.1 percent drop in energy prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Still, this is the third month in a row that the inflation rate has not been negative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier this year, when prices were falling, there were fears the eurozone was set for a potentially debilitating period of deflation - falling prices can weigh on economic activity by making consumers postpone purchases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a separate release, Eurostat said the eurozone unemployment rate was unchanged in May at 11.1 percent.</td></tr>
