<h3>SXSW: Tinder Users Are Falling for a Sexy Robot in Clever 'Ex Machina' Marketing Stunt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tinder users at the SXSW festival on Saturday were encountering an attractive 25-year-old woman named Ava on the dating app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A friend of ours made a match with her, and soon they were have a conversation over text message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But when he opened up Ava's Instagram, it became clear something was amiss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There was one photo and one video, both promoting Ex Machina, a sci-fi film that just happened to be premiering Saturday night here in Austin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The link in her bio went to the film's website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And it turns out the woman in the photos is Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, who plays an artificial intelligence in the movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It's pretty brilliant in the way it ties in to the movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Only in retrospect do you realize that Ava's questions are about a robot wanting to know what it's like to be human.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's also pretty invasive, and some will call it spammy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If you think about it, it's only a step above Tinder's porn bots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In this case, though, I'd give it a pass because it's such a strong fit conceptually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She's a bot in the movie, so of course she's a bot on Tinder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As for our friend - whose texts above, we can attest, were totally heartfelt - he found the whole thing impressively deceptive and shared it with others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But he was also a little crestfallen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It "toyed with my emotions so hard," he says.</td></tr>
