<h3>Ferguson: suspect arrested in shooting of police officers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clayton, Missouri: A 20-year-old man has been charged with first-degree assault in the shooting of two police officers in front of the Ferguson Police Department prosecuting attorney for St Louis County Robert McCulloch said..</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The man, Jeffrey Williams, acknowledged firing the shots, Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said Mr Williams, who is from north St. Louis County, was inside a car "at least for some of the shots".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jeffrey Williams, 20, is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action in connection with the shooting of two police officers who were keeping watch over a demonstration outside the Ferguson Police Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A handgun was recovered in his residence and matched shell casings found at the scene, according to Mr McCulloch, who said that although Mr Williams appears to be the only shooter, other people may be charged as the investigation continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was possible he was firing shots at someone other than the police but struck the police officers," Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Williams was in custody, Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The suspect was found through information provided by community members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The protests continued in St Louis, Missouri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr McCulloch said Mr Williams indicated that he had a dispute with some people who were in front of the police headquarters, "which had nothing to do with the demonstrations that were going on".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Williams indicated that he was firing at the people he had the dispute with, the prosecutor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He is a demonstrator," Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"He was out there earlier that evening as part of the demonstration. He's been out there on other occasions, part of the demonstrations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Williams was on probation for receiving stolen goods, Mr McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Several protest leaders quickly took to Twitter to say Mr Williams, who is African-American, was not one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>DeRay McKesson, who has been documenting the protests on social media since they started last summer, posted to his account, "No, I cannot recall ever seeing the suspected shooter, Jeffrey Williams, at any protests, including the night in question."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The two officers - one from the county police and the other from the nearby Webster Groves department - were standing shoulder to shoulder as part of a protective line facing demonstrators across the street from the police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At least three gunshots came from a distance behind the demonstrators, the authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A county police officer, 41, suffered a shoulder wound and a colleague, 32, from a nearby police department sustained a facial wound that left a bullet lodged near his ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Both were treated and released by a local hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The shooting ratcheted up tensions that have been simmering here since August 9, when a white police officer, Darren Wilson, fatally shot an unarmed, 18-year-old black man, Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A grand jury declined to indict Mr Wilson in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The shootings took place just hours after Ferguson's police chief resigned in the wake of a scathing US Justice Department report finding his force was rife with racial bias.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Chief Tom Jackson's resignation followed the departures of the city manager and a municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The report said the St Louis suburb overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to African-Americans to boost city coffers through fines, used police as a collection agency and created a culture of distrust.</td></tr>
