<h3>Suspect charged in shooting of police officers in Ferguson, Missouri</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FERGUSON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(Reuters) - A 20-year-old man was charged on Sunday with first-degree assault in last week's shooting of two policemen during a protest rally in Ferguson, Missouri, a crime that shocked a city that has been devastated by months of racial strife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The suspect, Jeffrey L. Williams, has admitted to firing the shots that wounded the officers early on Thursday, said St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The gunfire rang out just after midnight at the end of a rally to call for sweeping reforms in Ferguson, where an unarmed black 18-year-old was shot to death by a white officer last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Michael Brown's death touched off months of protests against law enforcement's treatment of minority groups, in Ferguson and around the country, and led to a U.S. Justice Department probe that found pervasive racial bias on the part of the city's mostly white police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Williams was arrested after a massive manhunt, with the help of tips from the public and video evidence, McCulloch told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An African American who had been on probation for possession of stolen property, Williams told investigators that he was not targeting police but was shooting at someone else, McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound and a 32-year-old from a nearby police department sustained a facial wound in Thursday's shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both were treated and released by a local hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Williams, whose bond was set at $300,000, appears to have fired a .40-caliber handgun from a car, McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A lawyer for Williams could not immediately be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A handgun was recovered in his residence and matched shell casings found at the scene, according to McCulloch, who said that although Williams appeared to be the only shooter, other people may be charged as the investigation continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This arrest sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated," U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The shootings took place just hours after Ferguson's police chief resigned in the wake of the scathing U.S. Justice Department report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chief Tom Jackson's resignation followed the departures of the city manager and a municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The extent to which Williams may have been involved in street demonstrations remains unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>McCullough said Williams may have participated in protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Several long-time activists said they did not recognize or know Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>One frequent protester, Bishop Derrick Robinson, told local media that he had spoken to Williams early on Sunday and said the shooting had nothing to do with the protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Robinson said Williams had told him that he had been robbed earlier that night, and had returned to the area and shot his gun in the air out of frustration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"He told me that he shouldn't have done it," Robinson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"He was embarrassed. He showed deep remorse. He wishes he could retract things."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>News of Sunday's arrest was greeted on the streets of Ferguson with a mix of relief and a sense that the protests would not fade away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I just hope they got the right guy, and that he gets what he deserves," said Gussie Klorer, a 60-year-old professor at St Louis University, adding she thought the arrest would have no bearing on the street demonstrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The protests seem to have a life of their own," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But the news also prompted a show of support for Ferguson's beleaguered police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Dozens of people gathered in front of police headquarters, many of them holding signs reading "We Support the Badge" and "Thank You Police."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>There was a brief clash on Sunday between the pro-police demonstrators and about 15 people who converged on them shouting "you support baby killers", while one among them trampled and ripped an American flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The two groups met in the middle of the street, face to face, and began shouting at each other, though tensions cooled after the pro-police group disbanded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Justice Department report said Ferguson police overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to black residents to boost city coffers through fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That helped create a culture of distrust that exploded in August when city police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown.</td></tr>

<h3>Survey: Young adults do consume news ? in their own way</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>on Thursday, March 12, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Morgan, 33, a pilot, says he still likes reading a printed newspaper, watching the news on his television, and using a search engine to dig more deeply if he wants to know more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He is among the majority of young adults in a survey who say they consult sources of news regularly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In this Friday, March 13, 2015 photo, Marilu Rodriguez checks a news website on her smartphone before boarding a train home at the end of her work week in Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Young adults have a reputation for being connected to one another, yet disconnected from the news, but a new survey has found, that mobile devices and, in some cases, social networking are keeping them more engaged with the broader world around them than previously thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Rodriguez' smartphone is her most frequent portal to the world, as she surfs social networking and news sites, often on her train ride to and from her work as a coordinator for a nonprofit organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Travis Morgan sits with a newspaper outside a coffee shop in Grants Pass, Ore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) - Young adults have a reputation for being connected to one another and disconnected from the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But a survey has found that mobile devices and social networking are keeping them more engaged with the broader world than previously thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They want news, they say, though they don't always aggressively seek it out - perhaps simply happening upon it on a friend's online feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And they want it daily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The survey of Americans ages 18 to 34, sometimes called the millennial generation, found that two-thirds of respondents said they consume news online regularly, often on a social networking site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Of those, 40 percent do so several times a day, according to the poll, conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the American Press Institute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's been a slowly building trend in news consumption that experts say is trickling up to older generations - and that young people say helps them stay current, even if they never read an actual newspaper or watch the evening news on TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I don't think people would expect us to know what we know," says Erica Quinn, a 24-year-old college student in Gainesville, Florida, who participated in the survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The findings were to be presented Monday in Nashville at the annual convention of the Newspaper Association of America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Among other things, the respondents said their consumption of news and information on various devices was most often sparked by an interest in civic issues, for social reasons, including discussing a topic with friends, or because they just find it enjoyable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The survey found that young adults generally get harder news from more traditional news sites and "softer" lifestyle news from social networks, Facebook being the overwhelming favorite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That's generally how it works for Marilu Rodriguez, a 29-year-old from suburban Chicago, who participated in a focus group that accompanied the survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She recalls how, as a child, the TV news would come on at her house after her family had watched the latest episode of their favorite telenovela, a Spanish-language soap opera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"It was a family thing to watch the news," Rodriguez says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Now her smartphone is her most frequent portal to the world, as she surfs social networking and news sites, often on her train ride to and from work as a coordinator for a nonprofit organization in downtown Chicago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Like many in the survey, she gets a lot of her news through a "diverse mix of friends" on those social networking sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>She considers herself an active seeker of news and still watches TV news, though she expressed frustration over slanted coverage and lack of serious stories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Some news stations need to grow up," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Still, only 39 percent of the survey respondents said they typically actively seek out news, while 60 percent said they mostly "bump into" that type of content as they do other things on Facebook and other sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That certainly could be seen as passive consumption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, noted that many respondents who generally let news come to them might comment on a story posted by a friend or look for more information because they were skeptical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"So there's a level of activity or participation that wasn't even possible in earlier times," says Rosenstiel, who will present the survey findings in Nashville.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He also noted that 70 percent of young adults surveyed say their social media feeds include a mix of viewpoints, increasing their chances of reading a wider array of content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Overall, the survey found that the average young adult regularly uses three or more social media platforms, among them Twitter, YouTube and sometimes Tumblr and Reddit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The youngest adults often use four social networking sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That said, survey respondent Travis Morgan says he still likes reading a printed newspaper and watching news on television - and using a search engine to dig more deeply if he wants to know more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"This may make me sound like an old man," Morgan, a 33-year-old pilot from Grants Pass, Oregon, says, laughing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I just want the story. I don't want opinion. I don't want all this extra stuff."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But that's not true for many of his elders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Experts who track the public's online habits say that on-the-go news consumption is growing among older generations as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Joseph Kahne, a professor who studies civic and political engagement online, has found a steady increase in news consumption and social media across all age groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>That's good for getting people more involved with topics of the day, says Kahne, an education professor at Mills College in Oakland, California, who chairs the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>But with so much content out there - often from lesser-known sources - he says it also means, "that all of us will need to become increasingly sophisticated, as we will need to make judgments regarding credibility that had previously been made by news editors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The survey of 1,046 young adults was conducted from Jan. 5 through Feb. 2, 2015, by the Media Insight Project, a partnership between the AP-NORC Center and the American Press Institute, which funded the study.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The results tallied online interviews in English or Spanish done with the random sample of adults age 18-34 who were initially recruited and screened to take part in the survey over the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>AP News Survey Specialist Emily Swanson contributed to this report.</td></tr>
