<h3>Ronaldo strikes again as Madrid wins to pressure Barcelona</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Madrid pulled to within one point of leader Barcelona which later visits a Sevilla side that hasn't lost at home in more than a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ronaldo sent a bouncing free kick over the wall and beyond goalkeeper Xabi Irureta in the 21st minute at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Little-used striker Javier Hernandez doubled the lead in the 31st, and youngster Jese Rodriguez capped the one-sided match in the 83rd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Madrid was able to give some of its regular bench players a rare start while several first-choice starters rested ahead of its Champions League quarterfinal at Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gareth Bale missed the match with a muscle strain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Coach Carlo Ancelotti started Hernandez instead of Karim Benzema, while Keylor Navas had a quiet day in goal replacing Iker Casillas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And the team didn't miss midfielders James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos, who served one-match suspensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Madrid's defense even got a boost when Pepe returned from injury as a second-half substitute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ronaldo received some help from Irureta to score his goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Eibar goalkeeper misjudged Ronaldo's free kick and moved out of position, leaving him unable to react in time and stop the ball from bouncing past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Madrid dominated the rest of the way as Hernandez and Rodriguez polished off the victory that kept Eibar in 14th place.</td></tr>
