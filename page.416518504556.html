<h3>Mets ace Matt Harvey slows Yankees in 8-2 win (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- Matt Harvey finished one out shy of a complete game, earning his first win against the team he rooted for growing up and leading the New York Mets to an 8-2 victory Saturday over the crosstown rival Yankees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kevin Plawecki hit his first major league home run and drove in three runs, and Lucas Duda and Eric Campbell also connected off an ineffective CC Sabathia (0-4).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Harvey (4-0) and the Mets rebounded from having their 11-game winning streak snapped in the Subway Series opener and kept pace with the 1986 team for best start in franchise history at 14-4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Juan Lagares went 4 for 4 with an RBI triple for the Mets, who got six of their seven RBIs from the Nos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>6-9 batters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the first Harvey Day at Yankee Stadium, the young ace from Connecticut didn't disappoint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Coming off Tommy John surgery, he received a nice ovation from Mets fans when he took the field for the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With two outs, Harvey gave up just his fifth hit and second walk to push his pitch count to 107 and end his outing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He pointed at his chest and said ''come on'' as manager Terry Collins came to make the change of pitchers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Harvey came within one out of his second complete game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Mets needed to wait an extra minute to celebrate 12th win in 13 games as the Yankees challenged a close play at second for the final out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Harvey struck out seven and yielded Mark Teixeira's third homer of the series, a drive to lead off the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The buzzing crowd of 47,909 stirred for the Dark Knight's first time facing baseball's favorite villain: Harvey struck out Alex Rodriguez with an 89 mph curveball after A-Rod fouled a 97 mph fastball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He struck out Rodriguez in the ninth, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Pitching with his balky left ankle taped, Harvey looked nimble fielding his position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He bounded off the mound and made a barehanded grab of a bouncer toward third base by Brian McCann in the second, then fielded Rodriguez's sharp shot up the middle with an acrobatic shuffle to end the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Yankees jumped out early Friday night in the opener of a much anticipated series between first-place Big Apple clubs for a 6-1 win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In this late afternoon start, the Mets broke things open after the shadows passed the pitcher's mound in the fourth inning to snap the Yankees' four-game winning run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Duda lined a flat breaking pitch with two outs from Sabathia just over the wall in right field to open the scoring in the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Didi Gregorius was credited with a single when he bunted with Stephen Drew on second and second baseman Daniel Murphy was late to cover first base in the third inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Jacoby Ellsbury followed by hitting into a double play that tied it 1-all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Mets got the lead right back against a fading Sabathia, scoring four times with two outs in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Lagares tripled in a run and Flores extended his career-best hitting streak to eight games with a blooped run-scoring single.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Plawecki then lined a shot into the left field stands for his first career RBIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Sabathia was lifted to boos after Campbell homered to right-center and Lagares singled to start the sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The big lefty, coming off an encouraging start in Detroit, allowed seven runs and nine hits in five-plus innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mets: Reliever Vic Black wrote on his blog that doctors have figured out that what was thought to be shoulder weakness is actually nerve irritation caused by a herniated disc in his neck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Black has been shut down for several days in his rehab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Yankees: Off to a poor start, OF Carlos Beltran was given a rest day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Manager Joe Girardi says there is nothing physically wrong with Beltran, who turned 38 Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mets: LHP Jonathon Niese is on a career-best run of allowing two runs or less for seven straight starts dating to last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In his previous start, Niese allowed a run in 6 2-3 innings to improve to 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA this year.</td></tr>
