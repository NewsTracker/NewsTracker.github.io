<h3>Monaco through on away goals despite home defeat</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Arsenal, looking to become the first team to overcome a two-goal home first-leg deficit in the Champions League, came agonisingly close to progressing after Olivier Giroud and substitute Aaron Ramsey scored in each half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the principality side's 3-1 win at the Emirates was just enough to see them through after Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic spectacularly denied striker Giroud five minutes from time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The hosts took a cautious approach as they tried to preserve their first-leg lead, failing to get a single shot on target, and were fortunate to make it into the last eight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Arsenal got off to a sluggish start in the last 16, second leg but Monaco struggled to contain them once Arsene Wenger's determined team got into their stride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The London side had the first clear chance but Giroud's header from Hector Bellerin's cross went just wide of the top corner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Arsenal's Laurent Koscielny came closer in the 23rd minute when he blasted the ball against the bar from a few metres out although the France defender was harshly adjudged to be offside even though the ball came to him from a Monaco head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Arsenal stepped up the pressure and were rewarded in the 36th when Subasic denied Giroud, only for the ball to fall into the path of the France forward who fired into the roof of the net.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A wave of panic then hit the Monaco players and Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck's attempt from just outside the area was blocked by defender Aymen Abdennour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Welbeck and Giroud were again denied as Monaco rode their luck to reach the break only one goal down on the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Subasic was made to work again seven minutes into the second half, tipping Mesut Ozil's free kick over the bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Monaco suddenly unleashed a flurry of attacks around the hour mark but the Arsenal defence, marshalled by Koscielny, held firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Wenger brought on attacking midfielder Ramsey for the more defensive Francis Coquelin in the 62nd, shortly before Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim took the opposite approach by replacing striker Dimitar Berbatov with midfielder Bernardo Silva.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Theo Walcott was then brought on for Welbeck as Arsenal pushed for a second goal, which came in the 79th when Ramsey fired a low shot past Subasic after Walcott had hit the post.</td></tr>

<h3>Feds: US Air Force vet tried to join Islamic State group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, of Neptune, New Jersey, was due Wednesday in a New York federal court after being indicted on answer charges of attempting to provide material support to a terrorist group and obstructing justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutors said Pugh had been stopped at a Turkish airport in January carrying a laptop with information on Turkey-Syria border crossing points, 180 jihadist propaganda videos including footage of an Islamic State prisoner beheading, and a letter declaring: "I will use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"There is only two possible outcomes for me. Victory or martyr," continued the letter, which authorities believe was to Pugh's Egyptian wife, investigators said in court papers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Pugh's lawyer, Michael K. Schneider, said Pugh would plead not guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Schneider declined to comment further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 47-year-old Pugh served in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990 and was trained in installing and maintaining aircraft engines and navigation and weapons systems, according to Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An airman first class, Pugh was assigned to the Woodbridge Air Base in England in July 1987 and Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona in July 1989, the Air Force said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pugh converted to Islam around 1998, court papers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After leaving the Air Force, he worked as an avionics specialist and airplane mechanic for a number of companies in the Middle East and the U.S. - including American Airlines, where the FBI got a 2001 tip about him from a co-worker who said Pugh expressed sympathy for Osama bin Laden, according to court papers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The airline said he left in early 2000 after a few months at American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 2002, an associate of Pugh's told the FBI that Pugh was interested in traveling to Chechnya to wage war, the investigators' court filing said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pugh worked on for DynCorp International in Iraq as an Army contractor in 2009 and 2010, the filing said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>McLean, Virginia-based DynCorp declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Pugh has been living overseas for the past year and a half, most recently in Egypt, investigators said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Last summer, Kuwait-based charter airline Gryphon Airlines considered hiring Pugh for a project but decided he didn't meet the requirements, the company said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He told an acquaintance in a December email that he'd been fired from his most recent job, according to investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Prosecutors said Pugh then decided to join the Islamic State group, traveling from Egypt to Turkey to ultimately cross the border into Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Pugh variously told authorities in Turkey and Egypt that he had gone to Turkey for vacation and to look for a job, and he said had no desire to go to Syria, court papers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But investigators said they found a chart of crossing points between Turkey and Syria, plus information about whether the border checkpoints were staffed, on Pugh's laptop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Investigators said his cellphone also had photos of a machine gun and airplanes, including an airplane bathroom and an area under passenger seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Department of Justice has charged roughly 20 people in the past year with planning to travel to the Middle East to fight alongside militants such as the Islamic State group, which controls parts of Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Federal officials have been concerned about Americans going overseas to train with these groups and returning with plots to carry out attacks at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We will continue to vigorously prosecute extremists, whether based here or abroad, to stop them before they are able to threaten the United States and its allies," Lynch said in a statement Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Three men were arrested late last month in a plot to travel to Syria; they have pleaded not guilty.</td></tr>
