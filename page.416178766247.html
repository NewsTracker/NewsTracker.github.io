<tr><td>2</td><td>A Syrian military source said the army was giving a chance for solutions aimed at resolving the situation in Yarmouk, which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said is "beginning to resemble a death camp".</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are very concerned of course about the survival needs of the people inside Yarmouk," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We called for a very clear respect for the civilians who are inside Yarmouk, we called for the possibility for civilians to temporarily leave in a safe way Yarmouk, to be able to be assisted outside. We will continue to call for this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We are thinking very strongly of how we can provide some form of assistance to the people who are inside," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group that monitors the four-year-old civil war via sources on the ground, has reported army air strikes on the camp since Islamic State moved in.</td></tr>
