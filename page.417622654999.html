<h3>IS in Egypt kills man accused of being police 'spy'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Egyptian branch of the Islamic State group released a video Monday showing the jihadists killing a man in North Sinai after accusing him of being a police "spy".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ansar Beit al-Maqdis -- which has pledged allegiance to IS and renamed itself "Sinai Province" -- has carried out a spate of deadly attacks on the peninsula since last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the video distributed on Twitter and YouTube on Monday, the Egyptian man accused of being a "spy" for the security services was shot in the neck by the jihadists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Before the killing, the man identified himself in front of the camera and said the security services had charged him with infiltrating the Sinai-based extremists and collecting information about them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jihadists have killed scores of police and soldiers in attacks on the Sinai peninsula since the army deposed Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They are seeking to establish a province of the self-declared IS "caliphate" straddling parts of Syria and Iraq and say the attacks are retaliation for a deadly government crackdown on Morsi's supporters since his ouster.</td></tr>
