<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dozens of people are wounded when a car bomb explodes in a Cairo suburb and IS affiliated militants claim responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cairo: An Islamic State affiliate claimed responsibility for the bombing of a local branch of the Egyptian security agency in Cairo on Thursday the third major attack by militants in the capital this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At least 20 people were wounded in the explosion, which was heard across the city around 2am and shredded the exterior of the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>An Egyptian worker checks a hole believed caused by a car bombing outside the national security building on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement that the source of the blast was a car bomb that had been left outside the white, five-storey structure by an unidentified man who then fled on a motorcycle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has struggled with a wave of unusually brazen militant attacks this summer, including by jihadis who have pledged loyalty to Islamic State operating in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Militant groups in Egypt intensified their campaign against the government about two years ago, after authorities killed hundreds of people while breaking up Islamist protest camps in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Journalists film and photograph a part from a massive car bomb that exploded in Shubra al-Kheima, Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite a strong counter-insurgency campaign by the government, the militants have demonstrated a persistent ability to carry out complex attacks on the military and other government security installations, and they have broadened their attacks to include civilian targets and tourist attractions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This month, Sinai province, another affiliate of Islamic State and Egypt's most active militant group, said it had beheaded a Croatian who was working in Egypt - the first time the group is known to have killed a foreign captive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Sisi signed a sweeping anti-terrorism bill on Sunday that officials said would expedite trials of militants.</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>The group said that the bombing on Thursday, in the working-class neighbourhood of Shubra al-Kheima, was carried out in retaliation for "the martyrs of Arab Sharkas" - a reference to the government's execution this year of six men in connection with attacks on Egyptian security forces.</td></tr>
