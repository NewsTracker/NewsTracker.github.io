<h3>Robert Durst, subject of HBO series The Jinx, arrested on murder warrant</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The arrest of Robert Durst, a wealthy eccentric linked to two killings and his wife's disappearance, came just before the finale in an HBO show about his life in which he said he "killed them all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the finale of The Jinx that aired Sunday evening on HBO, Durst was asked about similarities in handwriting in a letter he wrote and another linked to one of the killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Later, filmmakers said, Durst wore his microphone into the bathroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What followed was bizarre rambling in which Durst said, apparently to himself: "There it is. You're caught" and "What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The show ended, and it wasn't clear whether producers confronted Durst about the secretly recorded words, or what Durst meant by them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Durst was arrested by FBI agents Saturday at a New Orleans hotel on a warrant from Los Angeles for the murder of Susan Berman 15 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He appeared before a judge in New Orleans on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Durst, 71, waived extradition and will return to Los Angeles to face a murder charge in the 2000 death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Berman was killed as cold-case detectives prepared to question her in the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Durst moved to Texas after Berman's death, where he lived as a woman before being acquitted in the 2001 dismemberment death of his Galveston neighbour, Morris Black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Durst said that killing was in self-defence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Durst has always denied involvement in his wife's disappearance or Berman's murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Defence lawyer Chip Lewis, who successfully defended Durst in the Texas killing, said his client will waive extradition and be transported to Los Angeles to face the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"He's maintained his innocence for years," Lewis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Nothing has changed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The arrest came on the eve of Sunday's broadcast on HBO of the final episode of The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The documentary's filmmaker Andrew Jarecki told The Associated Press that Durst is a strange but smart man who has long feuded with his wealthy family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Jinx director Andrew Jarecki said he has come to a 'firm conclusion' about Durst's guilt or innocence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The story is so operatic," Jarecki said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"That's what's so fascinating to me - seeing someone who is born to such privilege and years later is living in a $300-a-month rooming house in Galveston, Texas, disguised as a mute woman."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Lewis, the attorney, said the arrest was orchestrated by Hollywood to come before the final episode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"No doubt," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It's all about Hollywood now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Lewis said he was familiar with the Berman killing and wasn't surprised by the arrest because of the number of emails and calls he got after last week's episode aired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He said new evidence touted by producers, however, was something he was already familiar with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I know all about this case," Lewis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"I have no doubt we will present a most compelling defence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Jarecki told a Hollywood version of Durst's story in the 2010 film that starred Ryan Gosling, All Good Things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A week before the release of that film, Durst called Jarecki saying he wanted to see it, and eventually agreed to be interviewed by Jarecki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That footage led to the documentary series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Jarecki said he has come to a "firm conclusion" about Durst's guilt or innocence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>HBO distributed the first two episodes in advance, making news with Durst's admission that he lied to investigators about what he did on the night of his wife's disappearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The other episodes were kept under wraps to maintain suspense as they aired each week.</td></tr>
