<h3>Terror plot suspect due in NYC court</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - A terror suspect is set to face charges he helped raise $1,600 in a plot to have U.S. residents travel overseas to fight for the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dilkhayot Kasimov's arraignment on charges of conspiracy and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in federal court in Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prosecutors have accused Kasimov of working closely with another man, Abror Habibov, to raise $1,600 for a third, Akhror Saidakhmetov, to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Saidakhmetov was carrying the cash when he was intercepted at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Feb. 25 trying to board a flight to Turkey, court papers say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After being detained on immigration charges, Kasimov, 26, admitted he delivered the money to the 19-year-old Saidakhmetov and knew that the teen "might be" traveling to Syria, court papers say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Agents also uncovered "electronic communications in which Kasimov encouraged others to participate in violent jihad," they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last month, Saidakhmetov, Habibov and Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev - all immigrants from the former Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan - pleaded not guilty in the same case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prosecutors accused Juraboev of also trying to travel to Syria via Turkey to join the Islamic State.</td></tr>
