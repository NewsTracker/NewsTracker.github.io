<tr><td>30</td><td>"Naturally, the people are furious, and they have not allowed them any choice. Unfortunately it's not in our hands anymore. That is, it's no longer in the people's hands. By necessity ... they will pass them in parliament, and by necessity we will bear their burden."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Greeks continued to struggle with limits on cash withdrawals and transfers outside of the country.</td></tr>
