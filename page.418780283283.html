<h3>Apple removes Nest Labs thermostats from U.S. stores</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Nest thermostat is installed in a home in Provo, Utah, January 15, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple Inc said it had removed Nest Labs' Internet-connected thermostats from its U.S. online and retail stores, a year after the home automation maker was bought by Google Inc for $3.3 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nest, led by the "godfather" of iPod Tony Fadell, earned plaudits for its thermostat - a round, brushed-metal device with a convex glass screen that displays temperature and changes hue to match the color of the wall it attaches to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We regularly make changes to our merchandise mix in stores," Apple spokesman Nick Leahy said in an email on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, checks by Reuters showed that the product was still available in Apple's online stores in some countries, including the UK, France and Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nest spokeswoman Ivy Choi did not comment on the removal of the company's thermostats from Apple's U.S. stores, but called the iPhone maker a "valued partner".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Our new products will be available through Apple in the coming weeks," she said.</td></tr>
