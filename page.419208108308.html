<h3>Group backing Hillary Clinton gets $1M from anonymous donors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton told a cheering crowd at her largest rally so far that "the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money" must be stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two weeks later, the main super PAC backing her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination accepted a $1 million contribution that cannot be traced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The seven-figure donation - made June 29 to the pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action - came from another super political action committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Its sole donors are nonprofits that are not legally required to reveal information about their contributors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Such contributions are sometimes called "dark money" by advocates for stricter campaign finance rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One group has called on the Clinton super PAC to return the money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But a spokesman says it is "playing by the rules."</td></tr>
