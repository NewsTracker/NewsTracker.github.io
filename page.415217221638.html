<h3>North Korea opens marathon to foreigners after Ebola ban lifted</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TOKYO - After lifting travel restrictions it imposed because of concerns over the Ebola virus, North Korea says foreigners can now take part in one of its most popular tourist events - the annual Pyongyang marathon, a travel agency said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Even though no cases of Ebola have been reported anywhere near North Korea, the country shut out foreign tourists in October with some of the strictest Ebola regulations in the world, including saying that only local runners would be allowed into the marathon in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Uri Tours, one tour company that takes tourists into North Korea, said on its website Thursday that it had been informed that North Korean authorities had "decided to re-open the doors to foreign amateur runners for the 2015 Pyongyang Marathon."</td></tr>
