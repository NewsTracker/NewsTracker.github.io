<h3>Greece poised to sign gas deal with Russia - Spiegel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN, April 18 (Reuters) - Greece is poised to sign a gas deal with Russia as early as Tuesday which could bring 3-5 billion euros into depleted government coffers, German magazine Der Spiegel reported, citing a senior figure in the ruling Syriza party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>During a visit to Moscow earlier this month, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras expressed interest in participating in a pipeline that would bring Russian gas to Europe via Turkey and Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Under the proposed deal, Greece would receive advance funds from Russia based on expected future profits linked to the pipeline.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Greek government officials were not immediately available to comment on the Spiegel report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The new government in Greece has been talking with its euro zone partners for months to try to secure aid and avert a default which could push the country out of the single currency bloc.</td></tr>
