<tr><td>3</td><td>Westbrook almost didn't get to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He picked up his 16th technical at Indiana on Sunday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>Portland coach Terry Stotts said Aldridge, who missed his second straight game, might play in the regular-season finale Wednesday at Dallas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I think it is important that if L.A. can play, that he can play, and he has been out for a little bit,'' Stotts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''I think that is important to kind of keep the edge, but how much?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Westbrook followed up his career-high 54-point effort Sunday by making 13 of 27 shots to extend his lead over Houston's James Harden in the race for the scoring title.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>Westbrook scored 13 points in the third quarter, and Oklahoma City led 81-70 heading into the fourth.</td></tr>
