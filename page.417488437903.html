<h3>Euro zone business growth loses some steam in May</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Euro zone business growth lost a little momentum last month despite companies cutting prices again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But euro zone firms also took on workers at the fastest rate in four years, a survey showed today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The deceleration in growth will be disappointing for the European Central Bank, coming just a few months after it embarked on a trillion-euro quantitative easing programme to try and drive growth and fuel inflation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to growth, stood at 53.6 in May, above an earlier flash reading of 53.4 but below April's 53.9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A reading above 50 implies growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The euro zone recovery lost some of the wind from its sails in May, with growth of output and new orders both slowing to three-month lows," said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Firms have been cutting prices since April 2012 but did so last month at the weakest rate in nearly a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The output price sub-index rose to 49.5 from April's 49.2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Official data yesterday showed prices in the bloc rose 0.3% last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With prices still falling the final PMI covering the bloc's service industry came in at 53.8, beating the flash reading of 53.3 but below April's 54.1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To meet demand, service firms increased headcount at the fastest rate since November 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The employment sub-index was 52.6, up from 51.8.</td></tr>
