<h3>'Infinite Monkey Cage': They have facts and they're not afraid to use them</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"We have an agenda," said the comedian Robin Ince the other day, between bites of a chicken sandwich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>These days, who doesn't?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Of course, the most effective polemical tool might not be calling your show "The Infinite Monkey Cage Live."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Or so you'd think.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Actually, "Infinite Monkey Cage," which is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 but commands a global audience through its podcasts, has a formidable following.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>(Both Ince and his partner, an academic named Brian Cox, are well-known names on the other side of the Atlantic.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We play music festivals in the U.K., and we get three or four thousand people who would otherwise be watching bands and who are either drunk or sunburned or afflicted by some 19th-century illness due to the dampness in their boots," said Ince, who - along with his pointy-headed pal Cox - is bringing "The Infinite Monkey Cage" to the Atheneum Theatre in Chicago on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Cox and Ince, along with their producer, Arnold Engelman, are hoping to snag the show's Midwestern podcast fan base, and maybe also a few interlopers from the land of "Wait, Wait & Don't Tell Me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Being smart dudes, they've persuaded Peter Sagal to join them onstage, along with Julia Sweeney, the former "Saturday Night Live" star who now lives in Chicago's northern suburbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Pythonesque "Monkey Cage" moniker conceals an interesting radio show, now in its eighth season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cox and Ince are joined by a rotating crew of other academics looking to burnish their populist bona fides, as well as other comics, such as Sweeney or (in LA) Eric Idle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This little U.S. "Monkey" tour is essentially a tryout for something much bigger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"To be honest," said Cox, seemingly on the other end of that same chicken sandwich, "our main motivation for coming to the States was to have access to U.S. academics at places like the University of Chicago."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After all, each show is driven by actual academic research - episodes have a topic and feature a panel composed equally of scientists (of an academic stripe) and comics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The former talk science.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The job of the latter, basically, is to make subjects like astrophysics entertaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And the agenda?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"To promote rational thought," said Cox, suggesting that the crusade of the "Cage," so to speak, is for facts to triumph over the ubiquity of opinion in this notorious age of the questionable social-media assertion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We never dumb anything down," said Ince.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Our job is to make ideas just exciting enough that you want to go the next step yourself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cox, who does a lot of U.K. TV, is known as a popularizer of science, especially for younger audiences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He says he is all about critical thinking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It is so easy to be wooed by opinion," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The Internet's horrible side is that however prosperous your idea, you can find other people who agree with you. We have to try and work out more ways of educating people on trust."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Part of that, says Ince, is making people feel comfortable talking about complex topics without fearing they will appear foolish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We get a lot of people listening to our shows who are on the cusp of making a decision to study science," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We're trying to tell them, don't be scared about approaching ideas about quantum cosmology."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Were it not for the lunch, Ince would likely have launched into a long discussion on the link between scientists and stand-up comics (one writes research papers; the other does research but delivers one-liners).</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But the hungry men did have time to answer one last question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>What was the most interesting topic the show ever covered?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I think," Cox said, "the question of when a strawberry is dead. I mean, you could plant jam in the ground and, from time to time, you'd probably get a strawberry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>8 p.m. Saturday at the Athenaeum Main Stage, 2936 N.</td></tr>

<h3>Andrew Chan and?Myuran Sukumaran families say goodbye Bali Nine smugglers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were convicted of being ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the island's airport for trying to smuggle 8kg of heroin to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They have been on death row since 2005 and have now been transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to be executed this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chan's mother Helen and brother Michael were today pictured at Yogyakarta airport as they made their way to the island via boat from Cilacap in central Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They were accompanied by Sukumaran's mother Raji and sister Brintha, although it is not known whether they will be allowed to see the men as hoped tomorrow when visits are usually banned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja - who Chan considers family - told Daily Mail Australia that prison officers would not allow him to see the Australians when he went to Nusakambangan today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Earlier, a 'chilling' picture emerged of an Indonesian police chief posing with a smile on his face next to Chan on the flight to the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the photograph, Djoko Hariutomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, grins as he stands with his hand on the shoulder of the convicted drug smuggler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In another picture, Hariutomo is seen with his hand on the shoulder of another condemned Australian, Myuran Sukumaran, on the same flight who gazed up at him as the camera flashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The planned executions of Sukumaran, 33, and Chan, 31, have caused diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Australia to fray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The pair are among a group of up to 11 convicts, mostly foreigners, due to be executed on the prison island of Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran were convicted in 2005 as the ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the holiday island's main airport for trying to smuggle 8kg (18lb) of heroin to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The seven other members of the gang, all Australians, have been jailed in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Thursday, Indonesia rejected an Australian proposal for a prisoner swap made in an 11th hour effort to save the lives of Sukumaran and Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Indonesia's foreign ministry said there was no legal basis for Indonesia to act on the proposal that had been made by Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'Basically Indonesia does not have any regulation or legal framework regarding a prisoner swap,' said Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Australian politicians held a candlelight dawn vigil outside parliament house in support of the men early on Thursday, when Bishop said she had spoken to Indonesia's foreign minister earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>'I raised the fact that there were Indonesian prisoners in Australian jails and whether there was an opportunity for us to consider a prisoner swap, a prisoner transfer or a clemency plea in exchange for a return of prisoners,' Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'I just asked for a pause in their preparations for the execution of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan so that we could have officials explore these ideas,' she told Sky News Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Australia does not have the death penalty and a recent survey by the Sydney-based Lowy Institute think tank showed nearly two-thirds of the public disapproved of the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had asked to speak again with Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In an interview with Al Jazeera, Widodo said the men would be executed soon, but not this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'I am still convinced that the justice system in Indonesia, if you look at drug crime, is valid and based on facts and evidence,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Indonesia is expected to decide on the date for the executions in a few days, said Tony Spontana, spokesman for the attorney general's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Widodo has adopted a tough stance against drug traffickers and others on death row, denying clemency appeals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Executions resumed in 2013 after a five-year gap and nationals from Brazil, Malawi, the Netherlands, Nigeria and Vietnam have been among those put in front of a firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Meanwhile, an old school friend has revealed Andrew Chan never thought his impending execution would actually happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The friend, who has known Chan since they met in Year 7 at Homebush Boys High in Sydney's west, told 9News the Bali Nine ringleader was calm when they spoke through text messaging application, Whatsapp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>At least once during their exchange, Chan texted him 'all good bro'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The spot where the executions are due to take place is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Do the best, God will finish the rest'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled for each prisoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.</td></tr>
