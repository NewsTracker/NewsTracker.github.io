<h3>Kailahun Ebola case report was a mistake, says Sierra Leone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sierra Leone said on Tuesday that it had mistakenly reported an Ebola positive case in Kailahun, a former hotspot for the virus which has not seen a case for nearly four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A nine-month-old baby was pronounced Ebola positive last week but was later found to have died from other causes, according to National Ebola Response Centre spokesman Sidi Yahya Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He blamed the mistake on a "lapse" by health officials who took the blood sample from the corpse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kailahun, which borders Guinea, was the first district in Sierra Leone to report a case of the hemorrhagic fever last May and at its peak recorded around 80 cases a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nearly 3,800 people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone as a whole but numbers are falling as steps to control the disease take hold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kailahun district council chairman Alex Bonapha said the false test result had resulted in deaths at a local clinic where medical staff were quarantined as a precaution, "leaving the patients without care."</td></tr>
