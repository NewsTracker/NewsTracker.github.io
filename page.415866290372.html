<h3>Arizona governor signs bill blocking abortion coverage through Obamacare</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona Republican Governor Doug Ducey signed a law on Monday that requires doctors to tell women that drug-induced abortions can be reversed and that blocks the purchase of insurance on the Obamacare health exchange that includes abortion coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The requirement that patients be told that the effects of abortion pills may be undone by using high doses of a hormone was the most hotly contested provision during legislative debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Supporters said there was ample evidence the reversal was possible if acted upon quickly, although they provided no peer-reviewed studies in support of their position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Critics called the argument "junk science."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The bill cleared the Republican-controlled Legislature last week, largely along party lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In December, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked Arizona from enforcing a state law that restricted access to abortion-inducing drugs by prohibiting off-label uses of RU-486, known as the "abortion pill."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a statement regarding the bill's provision barring women from buying coverage on the federal healthcare exchange that includes abortion, Ducey said: "The American people overwhelmingly oppose taxpayer funding of abortions, and it's no different in Arizona, where we have long-standing policy against subsidizing them with public dollars."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Opponents said there was no proof public dollars had been used for the elective procedures and called the measure an overreach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bryan Howard, president of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona, said the bill's signing again put Arizona in a bad light for "interfering in the medical decisions of women," and vowed to keep opposing the law through "all of our options, including litigation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Supporters of the measure, which exempts cases of incest, rape and life-saving situations, said the ban was needed because many individuals insured through the federally run exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, received government subsidies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Countless more lives will be saved, and women spared a lifetime of regret," said Cathi Herrod, president of the conservative Center for Arizona Policy.</td></tr>
