<h3>Afghanistan fall short on World Cup debut</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Afghanistan thrilled thousands of flag-waving expatriates at Manuka Oval earlier in the day by making a promising start to its debut match in the 50-over tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They took four early wickets and then rallied after Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim combined for a 114-run partnership to bowl Bangladesh, which won the toss, out for 267.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Afghanistan was never in the match in reply, failing to hit its first boundary until the 10th over and requiring an unlikely nine runs per over with 15 overs to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was all out for 162 runs in 42.5 overs.</td></tr>

<h3>Hundreds gather in Melbourne for mercy for Bali nine death row prisoners</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Melbourne has stood for mercy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Under heavy skies that broke open more than once, Federation Square swelled with supporters seeking clemency for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, the two Australian prisoners facing the firing squad in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The prevailing mood among the hundreds who gathered for the vigil on Wednesday night was hope rather than resignation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Speakers told the crowd that a delay in the pair's transfer to their final place of execution had bought them precious time and that there was still a chance their lives would be saved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But as bells rang out from St Paul's Cathedral and drifted across the city, they also toll for Sukumaran and Chan in Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Artist and friend Matthew Sleeth, who organised the vigil, spoke about how the pair had changed their lives for the better in prison and that they would make the community a better place if given a second chance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said he never thought the day would come when Sukumaran and Chan would be executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Musicians Clare Bowditch, Bob Evans and Missy Higgins showed their support by performing for the vigil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Matthew Goldberg, from Mercy, said there had been nearly 200,000 signatures on a petition for clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Family Drug Support founder Tony Trimingham, whose son died of a heroin overdose, said the worst pain was yet to come for the families of Sukumaran and Chan, should the convicted drug smugglers be put in front of the firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a letter read by MC Eddie Perfect, Chan asked those who had attended to think about the meaning of the word mercy.</td></tr>
