<h3>'Unfinished Business': Film Review</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>His new film, Unfinished Business, falls into that last subcategory - perhaps not coincidentally, as it, too, was directed by Ken Scott (Delivery Man was Scott's remake of his own homegrown Quebecois hit, Starbuck).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A guys-gone-wild romp in the well-worn tradition of Todd Phillips' Hangover franchise, this is the latest example of a movie that doesn't work hard enough to freshen up formulas used and abused by filmmakers like Phillips, Judd Apatow, Nicholas Stoller (Neighbors), Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses) and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Indeed, Unfinished Business will seem woefully familiar to most anyone who's been to a movie theater - or taken a long plane ride - over the past 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Male sexual panic gags involving penises?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Check. Drug-fueled bacchanals shown in slow-mo?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Check. Car high jinks (here involving a German-language GPS)?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Check. Disposable, misogynistically conceived female characters?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Check. Lessons learned (don't be a bully; never give up; appreciate what you have)?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And check, please.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Vaughn plays Dan, a St. Louis sales exec who quits his job toiling for a bullying boss named Chuck (Sienna Miller, gamely overdoing a brassy American accent) and starts his own company with two fellow workplace outcasts: retirement-age Timothy (Tom Wilkinson) and sweet-natured but slow-witted Mike (Dave Franco, you-know-who's little brother).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The unlikely trio travels first to Maine, then to Europe in an effort to beat out Chuck for a lucrative deal with a firm fronted by Jim Spinch (James Marsden, smarming it up).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Needless to say chaos ensues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Unfinished Business never works up enough momentum to get us into the anarchic spirit of things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The movie unfolds, choppily, as a series of half-hearted set pieces written and directed with little flair or commitment and no connective tissue between them; some of those sequences scarcely run long enough to register, as if the studio couldn't decide whether or not they were worth keeping in the final cut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Like The Wedding Ringer, another mediocre male-bonding flick released during the early-2015 dump months, Unfinished Business goes through the motions, offering up ostensibly outrageous sights and situations - a hotel maid who's actually a sex worker; Mike's quest to master a certain coital position; a professional negotiation hashed out amid the glory holes of a gay club - either so derivative or so listlessly staged as to barely warrant a raised eyebrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When it's not indulging in lowbrow sex humor (not a bad thing in itself, mind you), the script, courtesy of Steven Conrad (The Pursuit of Happyness), tosses around some very lame jokes - sometimes repeatedly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Much is made, for instance, of the fact that a main character's last name is Pancake; are you laughing yet?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Even one of the movie's more gently amusing bits, Mike's serial mispronunciation of words like "exploit" and "imperative," is run into the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Vaughn's work here might be best described as functional - he does a very slight variation on the same persona he's been playing for years: the brash guy with a heart of gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>As appealing and assured a comic performer as he is, the actor hasn't stretched or challenged himself in a long time; Unfinished Business makes one hope, more urgently than ever, that he has something else up his sleeve on the next season of True Detective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meanwhile, Wilkinson's role consists essentially of uttering words like "pussy," "titty" and "cock," as if the prospect of an actor of a certain age - and a Brit, at that!</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>- cursing is all the comedy anyone needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If the movie has a bright spot, it's Franco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Speaking in stoner-surfer cadences, his face regularly expanding into an infectiously goofy grin, the actor is the one person onscreen who seems determined to cobble together what little he's given into a distinctive character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>As a director, Scott is workmanlike though uninspired, displaying little visual imagination and even less sense of risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Undemanding audiences may be satisfied, but Unfinished Business is the cinematic equivalent of subpar fast food (think Carl's Jr. or Jack in the Box): It's cheap, easy and maybe even tasty for a second or two, but leaves you feeling queasy and undernourished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In other words, take your business elsewhere.</td></tr>

<h3>Putin: Nemtsov's murder carried "political subtext"</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext. Russia should be devoid at last of the kind of shame and tragedies that we have recently endured and seen," he said in a speech during a meeting with officials from the interior ministry on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I mean the murder, the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital," Putin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, was shot dead as he walked with his girlfriend on Friday night near Red Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in Russia during Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Kremlin has denied any involvement, saying that the killing was a "provocation" designed to discredit Putin and strengthen his opponents, but Nemtsov's supporters say the Kremlin is to blame for fomenting an atmosphere of hatred towards its opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Law enforcement officials have said one lead they were exploring was that the killing was linked to Nemtsov's personal life or business dealings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Putin's comments indicated that version is now being discarded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Authorities have not made any arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Earlier on Wednesday, the director of Russia's Federal Security Service said that an investigation had identified several suspects, without giving details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Russian news agencies reported that investigators were seeking a car in connection to the killing that may be connected to the finance ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Boris Nemtsov was laid to rest at a Moscow cemetery after thousands paid last homage to the slain former prime minister.</td></tr>
