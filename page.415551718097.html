<h3>Starbucks joins the race debate as clashes in Ferguson and elsewhere escalate tension</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The coffee chain known for its Frappuccinos says it will elaborate on the plans at its annual shareholder meeting Wednesday in Seattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Already, workers at its U.S. stores have been told to write "Race Together" on cups and the company plans to start publishing "conversation guides" on the topic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The decision has sparked a backlash on social media, with people saying it's opportunistic for a coffee chain to try and inject itself into such an important issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But it comes as corporate executives say customers are drawn to companies that project some sort of feel-good image or embrace positions on social causes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the annual meeting for Yum Brands Inc., the company that owns KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, CEO Greg Creed said in December that fast-food chains must to evolve from being perceived as "impersonal and industrial" to being able to "demonstrate that we do care."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Laura Ries, a branding consultant based in Atlanta, said that addressing big important, issues of the day has also become a way for companies to make themselves a part of the conversation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Otherwise, nobody is sitting around on Twitter discussing brands, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>People, however, don't associate their morning coffee with race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There's nothing wrong with talking about race relations," Ries said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"But is it something people naturally associate with Starbucks? It's not."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Inserting itself into national issues is not new territory for Starbucks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In late 2012, the chain asked workers to write "Come together" on cups to send a message to lawmakers about stalled budget negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And in 2013, the chain placed newspaper ads saying that firearms were not welcome in its cafes after they became the site of gun rallies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the company stopped short of an outright ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>CEO Howard Schultz said at the time that Starbucks was neither for nor against guns, underscoring that even a company that wants a voice in national conversations, it must avoid alienating customers, regardless of their political or social views.</td></tr>

<h3>South Sudan's Kiir shrugs off U.N. threat of sanctions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>South Sudan's President Salva Kiir (C) acknowledges his supporters as he arrives to address a rally at John Garang's Mausoleum in the capital Juba March 18, 2015, on the peace talks process with South Sudan's rebel leader Riek Machar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fighting since December 2013 between forces loyal to Kiir and rebels allied with his former deputy Machar has reopened ethnic fault lines that pit Kiir's Dinka people against Machar's ethnic Nuer forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan President Salva Kiir on Wednesday dismissed the threat of U.N. sanctions after the Security Council passed a resolution this month that set up a framework for introducing punitive measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kiir also told South Sudanese at a rally in Juba that the government was ready to continue fighting rebels if they preferred war, comments likely to frustrate African mediators and Western powers trying to end more than a year of conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The United States and others have shown increasing annoyance with Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar, the former deputy president, whom they blame both for putting personal political ambitions above the need for peace in the world's newest nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The threat of sanctions has been waved in my eyes ... but I cannot be threatened with that," Kiir told thousands of supporters in Juba's Freedom Square, the site of its independence celebrations in mid-2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kiir said he appreciated foreign efforts to bring peace to but said he was "disappointed" that some of the international community had focused on sanctions "rather than encouraging the peace building process".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The U.N. Security Council approved a U.S.-drafted sanctions regime on March 3 but did not impose travel bans and asset freezes on officials or an arms embargo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Washington said the aim was to tell those who chose war over peace that they would be held to account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The United States and European Union have already independently imposed travel bans and asset freezes on commanders on both sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Peace talks have made glacial progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both sides agree in principle to sharing power but have failed agree on how that would work in practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The latest round of peace talks in Ethiopia broke down on March 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>At least 10,000 people have been killed and 1.5 million civilians have fled their homes in violence during which both sides have been accused of ethnic-based atrocities, mass rapes, and using child soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kiir, once a rebel commander in the war against Sudan's government before independence, said rebels had rejected his peace overtures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"If they prefer to fight for their victory, I think I am ready to fight back," he said.</td></tr>
