<h3>Tekmira says Ebola drug unlikely to work in study</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Drugmaker Tekmira said Friday that an experimental treatment for a strain of Ebola will probably fail in a clinical trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Canadian company said the mid-stage study reached a statistical futility boundary, meaning it's unlikely the trial will show the drug worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tekmira said it stopped enrolling new patients as a result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is analyzing data from the trial and will make the results available as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company's shares dropped $1.74, or 11.6 percent, to $13.28 on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp. calls the drug TKM-Ebola-Guinea and it is designed to target the strain of the virus that is responsible for the active outbreak in West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>More than 11,000 people have died since that outbreak began in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The company has been studying the drug in Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tekmira is also running an early-stage trial of a drug called TKM-Ebola, which targets a slightly different strain of the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That study is happening in the U.S. and it involves only healthy patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tekmira expects results from that study in the second half of this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The company does not have any approved drugs and is also studying a potential treatment for hepatitis B.</td></tr>
