<h3>Boko Haram using civilians as human shields, Nigerian official says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mike Omeri, director general of the National Orientation Agency, would not say how many people are being used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Some say 500, some 400, some say 300," but Omeri said he was awaiting reports from authorities on the ground around Damasak, a trading town near the border with Niger that was recaptured on March 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Omeri stressed this was not a new incident and that the authorities are investigating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Instead, he said that as troops advanced, Boko Haram rushed to a school where people had been held after the insurgents had seized the town late last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said the fighters and those being used as shields still are in the Damasak area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The soldiers who recaptured Damasak found the town largely deserted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The troops from Chad and Niger who now hold Damasak have discovered evidence of a mass grave, Chad's ambassador to the United Nations, Mahamat Zene Cherif, confirmed Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Boko Haram has killed thousands of civilians and kidnapped unknown hundreds in its fight to create an Islamic state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The group was little known until it caused international outrage with its mass kidnapping almost a year ago of 276 girls from a government boarding school in northeast Chibok town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dozens escaped in the first couple of days, but 219 remain missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Their fate remains unknown and spawned the #BringBackOurGirls campaign on social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nigeria's battle against the Islamic extremists is a major issue for critical presidential elections to be held Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>International concern has mounted along with the toll: an estimated 10,000 killed in the six-year-old insurgency last year alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Boko Haram has vowed to violently disrupt the elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>International assistance desperately is needed for the thousands of Nigerian refugees who have fled the violence, the head of the U.N. refugee agency said Wednesday as he visited a camp in Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Violence in Nigeria has forced more than 192,000 people to flee to the neighboring countries of Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the U.N. refugee agency says the crisis hasn't drawn sufficient international support, calling it one of the most underfunded emergencies in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>At Cameroon's Minawao refugee camp, residents aren't getting enough to eat or drink, and there aren't enough toilets or medical supplies, Isaac Luka, a representative of the refugees, said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said the agency will funnel more resources to Cameroon, but he noted that they have only received 3 percent of the funding necessary to run Minawao, which is home to 33,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Every country in the world needs to understand that Cameroon is not only protecting itself, Cameroon is protecting all of us," he said.</td></tr>
