<h3>Iraqi troops, militia retake strategic town north of Tikrit from Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iraqi security forces and militias known as Hashid Shaabi stand with their weapons in the town of al-Alam March 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>AL-ALAM, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi troops and militias drove Islamic State insurgents out of the town of al-Alam on Tuesday, clearing a final hurdle before a planned assault on Saddam Hussein's home city of Tikrit in their biggest offensive yet against the ultra-radical group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The power base of executed former president Saddam's clan, Tikrit is the focus of a counter-offensive against Islamic State by more than 20,000 troops and Shi'ite Muslim militias known as Hashid Shaabi, backed by local Sunni Muslim tribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If Iraq's Shi'ite-led government is able to retake Tikrit it would be the first city clawed back from the Sunni insurgents and would give it momentum in the next, pivotal stage of the campaign - to recapture Mosul, the largest city in the north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A Reuters photographer saw dozens of families, who earlier fled al-Alam to escape Islamic State rule, return to the town, celebrating and slaughtering sheep for the victorious forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I announce officially that the town is under the total control of security forces, the Hashid Shaabi (Popular Mobilization) units and local tribal fighters," said local mayor Laith al-Jubouri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We rejoice in this victory and we want al-Alam to be the launchpad for the liberation of Tikrit and Mosul," he told Reuters by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mosul in the far north is the largest city held by the ultra-radical Islamic State, who now rule a self-declared cross-border caliphate in Sunni regions of Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the ultra-radical group over the past few months has gradually lost ground in Iraq to the army, Shi'ite militias and Kurdish peshmerga forces, backed by air strikes carried out by a U.S.-led coalition of mainly Western and allied Arab states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The United States says Baghdad did not seek aerial backup from the coalition in the Tikrit campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Instead, support on the ground has come from neighboring Iran, Washington's longtime regional rival, which backs the Shi'ite militias and has sent an elite Revolutionary Guard commander to oversee part of the battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Iraqi army and militias now control the two towns to the north and south of Tikrit along the Tigris river and appear ready to move on the city itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Security officials said the assault could start as early as Wednesday, although the 10-day campaign has so far been marked by gradual and steady advances rather than rapid attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Security officials said Islamic State fighters blew up a bridge over the Tigris on Tuesday, aiming to hinder any advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Both al-Dour and al-Alam lie on the east bank of the river, opposite Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But the army has a large military base on the same western side from which it could send forces into Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hundreds of Shi'ite army recruits who abandoned the Speicher military base last June were shot dead in one of the biggest mass killings carried out by Islamic State fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>There have been fears that the Shi'ite-dominated security forces and militia would seek revenge on local Sunni residents for the Speicher killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the nearby village of Albu Ajil, local officials said houses had been set on fire by the militia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Some houses were also set alight in al-Alam, but local tribal fighters said they belonged to security force members and government workers and were burnt by the retreating insurgents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A local official said security forces and militias had regained control over the Ajil oilfield northeast of al-Alam, but other sources said the situation was still unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Black smoke columns could still be seen rising from the area and Jubouri, the al-Alam mayor, said Islamic State fighters set ablaze at least 10 wells in the oilfield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He could not confirm it was completely under the control of security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>An Interior Ministry source said two of the ministry's armored vehicles were hit by Islamic State missiles or rockets north of al-Alam, and heavy clashes were taking place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He did not give details of casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Reuters photographer inside al-Alam saw two destroyed Islamic State vehicles, which had been targeted by army helicopters on Tuesday, with charred bodies still inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Islamic State has sent reinforcements to Tikrit from other parts of its "caliphate" further north, where it came under attack on Monday from Kurdish forces around the oil-rich-city of Kirkuk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A Kurdish commander said his forces would press on with their offensive and had captured another village on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They had stopped in an area called Kwas, but would resume in coming days, Major General Omar Hassan said.</td></tr>

<h3>Sheriff Dart: Candy bar thief shouldn't have spent months in jail</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At a Tuesday news conference at the county jail, Dart told reporters the system is "not set up to care" about detainees in jail on minor offenses who sometimes wait for months as their cases wind their way through the court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One man spent 114 days in jail, which the sheriff's office runs, allegedly for stealing packs of Snickers bars-at a cost to taxpayers of more than $16,000, according to Dart, who used the case as one example of "the outrageous amounts of money we spend incarcerating the wrong people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Are we putting him on a rigorous program to get him off of Snickers bars?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This is stupidity of the highest order."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The culprit, Dart said, is a system that rewards "benign neglect" rather than actively looking for ways to get low-level defendants out of jail-leading not just to mass incarceration but "unjust incarceration."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Society says, 'We'll just stick them in there for now,'" Dart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Why are they here? Why are they here this long? ... It's indicative of a system that's not set up to care."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Beginning next week and continuing weekly, county officials will identify five to 10 cases "where we feel people [should] not be there," Dart said, and meet with public defenders and county prosecutors to brainstorm ways to fast track those cases through the court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dart also announced plans to propose legislation in Springfield instituting a "rocket docket" for cases of retail theft and criminal trespassing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The county would be given 30 days to work out those cases, and if they could not be resolved in that time, defendants would be released on recognizance bonds or electronic monitoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If approved by lawmakers, the "rocket docket" could be a model for low-level drug cases, Dart said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The sheriff also plans to propose to county judges a diversion program for mentally ill defendants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We need to save our venom, our resources, for violent people," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Dart has dubbed the Cook County Jail, near 26th Street and California Avenue, the largest mental health facility in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It currently houses 8,500 detainees; its capacity is about 11,000, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The typical resident of Cook County Jail is a black man from Chicago in his early 30s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It costs $143 to house one detainee for one day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jail population traditionally spikes in the summer months, and Dart said this year would be no different, though he does not anticipate overcrowding issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In other recent attempts to keep jail population down, the county has released more and more defendants awaiting trial; in 2014 nearly half of defendants were allowed to go home between court dates rather than pay bail-up from 21 percent in 2011.</td></tr>
