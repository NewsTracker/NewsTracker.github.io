<tr><td>5</td><td>German prosecutors said Andreas Lubitz, 27, who deliberately caused the crash in the French Alps, had therapy for suicidal tendencies some time before getting his pilot's licence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And he was being treated by a psychotherapist, Dusseldorf prosecutor's office spokesman Christoph Kumpa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'At that time he was being treated for what is documented as being suicidal,' Mr Kumpa said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He added that Lubitz paid several visits to doctors right up until the time of the crash but these did not involve suicidal tendencies.</td></tr>
