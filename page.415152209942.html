<h3>Bali Nine execution move edges nearer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The dreaded date had been delayed by Indonesia's ill preparations for the mass execution and hope had been invested in legal appeals and pleas from as high up as the Australian prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But after a string of co-ordination meetings and shifting time frames, Bali's chief prosecutor, Momock Bambang Samiarso, on Tuesday set the date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Co-ordination has been completed, the transfer will be tomorrow at noon," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said it was devastating news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I am dismayed by reports that Andrew and Myuran are to be transferred by Indonesian authorities in preparation for their execution," she said in a statement on Tuesday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She said she would continue to contact her counterparts in Indonesia to press for a stay of execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Given their rehabilitation, it is callous for these executions to proceed," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prison governor Sudjonggo told reporters the Bali Nine pair were aware the day had come to leave Kerobokan jail, their home since the failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In that time, they have become its model prisoners, Sukumaran guiding others through art classes and Chan with religious ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sudjonggo said Sukumaran had joked that he now didn't have time to paint him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"They already know," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"When Myuran was talking to me, he was still laughing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The men had left their belongings - such as clothes, food, bedding and kitchen utensils - with their inmate friends, including other members of the Bali Nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They were saying their goodbyes, Sudjonggo said, with Sukumaran overheard telling friends to be careful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I didn't ask if he was ready or not, but I can see from his gestures," the governor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He was still talking, still laughing, still chatting with his friends."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sukumaran's mother Raji and Chan's brother Michael had visited the prison before the news was made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The pair's lawyers have just lodged another appeal in a bid to have the facts of their case - the rehabilitation of Chan and Sukumaran - considered in the courts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In Jakarta, Todung Mulya Lubis begged for the executions to be stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I plead to the president, I plead to the attorney-general, please wait for the legal process to be completed," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But on Monday, the attorney-general rejected the idea the executions should be delayed for those among the 10 drug offenders scheduled for execution who have legal appeals pending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"If there's already clemency (rejected), there should be no more other legal challenges submitted," HM Prasetyo told reporters on Monday.</td></tr>
