<h3>Sepp Blatter set for another win in FIFA election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Thursday, Feb. 19, 2015 file photo, Luis Figo speaks to the media as he launches his FIFA Presidential Campaign manifesto, at Wembley Stadium, London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sepp Blatter's widely expected re-election on May 29 as president of soccer's world governing body for a fifth term has seldom seemed a real contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Three rival candidates entered the race in January: Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, Luis Figo of Portugal and Michael van Praag of the Netherlands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Van Praag, however, dropped out of the race on Thursday May 21, 2015, and switched his support to FIFA vice president Prince Ali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FILE - In this Wednesday, March 4, 2015 file photo, FIFA President Sepp Blatter attends a general Conmebol congress in Asuncion, Paraguay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sepp Blatter's widely expected re-election on May 29, 2015 as president of soccer's world governing body for a fifth term has seldom seemed a real contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For once, a major FIFA election is untainted by claims of vote-buying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There's no need this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His hold on the top job is so secure that Blatter published no manifesto, declined to debate opponents and rarely engaged with media worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I am not campaigning," Blatter said in March at a FIFA news conference he was obliged to attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I am now 40 years in FIFA, and I am 17 years as president of FIFA. This is my manifesto."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Van Praag, however, dropped out of the race on Thursday and switched his support to FIFA vice president Prince Ali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>By withdrawing, Van Praag showed how the task to sway Blatter's rock-solid support looked impossible even before belatedly starting to seek votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If you really wanted to do this properly you should have started (campaigning) two years ago," Van Praag, the Dutch soccer federation president, said in Vienna in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The outcome has looked clear since February 2014 when Blatter dropped his biggest hint that he would run again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He teased he "would not say no" if enough of FIFA's 209 member federations asked him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Despite the scandals and allegations often swirling around FIFA, voters worldwide show little or no desire for change at the top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Familiarity with Blatter has bred content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He was FIFA's top administrator and, therefore, point man to members for 17 years before his controversial first election in 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Blatter's presidential watch, FIFA has risen from financial crisis in 2001 to sit on a growing $1.5 billion reserve fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>FIFA earned almost $5 billion directly from the 2014 World Cup and rewarded all 209 members equally well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The smallest island federation in the Caribbean or South Pacific got the same bonus payments totaling $1.05 million from FIFA's tournament profits as World Cup champion Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Each member has equal voting power at the congress when changing FIFA rules or picking a president - as each federation helps do every four years in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>FIFA pays for a three-person delegation from each of the 209 to attend the election in its home city, one of the world's most expensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It adds up to Blatter being able to count on most voters in five of FIFA's six continental confederations during his reign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Even UEFA has pockets of support for him, especially within the Russian sphere of influence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Since the candidate deadline passed, four confederations which held their annual assemblies blocked Blatter's opponents from making formal speeches to potential voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The three rivals sat and watched in Asuncion, Paraguay; Cairo, Egypt; Nassau, Bahamas; and Manama, Bahrain as FIFA's game of democracy played out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Meanwhile, FIFA protocol allowed Blatter to address all those meetings, without explicitly referring to the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He also met voters when attending finals at the Asian Cup and African Cup of Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>This strategy of official non-engagement has proved effective for Blatter, limiting possible mistakes and offering no stage for his opponents to make gains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The exception was UEFA's annual meeting in Vienna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Blatter had a front row seat to hear executive committee colleague Prince Ali describe FIFA as "authoritarian," and Van Praag talk of disarray, nepotism and corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Today, Blatter's rivals remain relatively unknown to voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It was very different four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Then, the rival candidate was a confederation president, Asian soccer's then-leader Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Bin Hammam challenged his former ally after more than a decade overseeing FIFA project grants totaling tens of millions of dollars to potential voters, and months after helping Qatar win the 2022 World Cup hosting rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Carrying that momentum, Bin Hammam seemed a genuine threat until being taken down in a bribery scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Caribbean voters were each offered $40,000 in cash three weeks before election day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In 1998, when Bin Hammam was a key campaigner for Blatter's first election, it was said that $50,000 offers to some African voters in a Paris hotel decisively swayed the result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Bin Hammam was also in Blatter's inner circle for the 2002 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Blatter has spent half his life devoted to FIFA and its family of officials, making him difficult to unseat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>UEFA President Michel Platini, an all-time great player for France and one-time FIFA protege of Blatter, chose not to try.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Announcing his decision last August not to run, Platini denied that an election fight against Blatter was "unwinnable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2015 file photo FIFA vice president Jordan's Prince Ali bin al-Hussein speaks during an interview with The Associated Press after his FIFA presidency campaign launch press conference in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>FILE - In this Wednesday Jan. 28, 2015 file photo, Dutch football association leader Michael van Praag elaborates on his candidacy for the FIFA presidential election race during a press conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>FIFA presidential candidate Michael van Praag has withdrawn from the May 29 election against Sepp Blatter, saying in a statement Thursday May 21, 2015, he has switched his support to Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan.</td></tr>
