    <title>&lt;p&gt;Nintendo, which already warned its annual operating profit would halve on weak console sales, said on Tuesday it was teaming up with online gaming firm DeNA Co Ltd to develop and operate gaming apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Iwata didn't disclose any details about Nintendo's first mobile game, he said it would not be a hand-me-down from the company's famed console titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For DeNA, which grew from a startup launched in 1999 to a major online gaming company, a tie-up with Nintendo will help it regain momentum lost in the past two years as users moved on to more popular gaming apps.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;The announcement Tuesday means that Nintendo's trademark game characters such as Super Mario and Pokemon could finally feature on smartphones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such characters have been fiercely protected by Nintendo, appearing only on Nintendo platforms such as the Wii home console and 3DS mobile machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides said they will build a global membership service for various devices including personal computers, smartphones and Nintendo machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said the mobile games won't be mere adaptations of the games already out for the Nintendo machines but developed especially for the smartphone experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alliance will be combining Nintendo's intellectual property and game development skills with DeNA's expertise in mobile games, the announcement said.&lt;/p&gt;</title>
