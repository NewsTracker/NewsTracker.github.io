<h3>Google's Project Fi: Sounds cool, will it work?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google's Project Fi sounds cool, but will it work?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This isn't the first time Google has been a disruptive agent of change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Its Project Fi wireless service is, however, potentially one of the most significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>NEW YORK - This isn't the first time Google has been a disruptive agent of change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It is, however, potentially one of the most significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Internet powerhouse's bold foray into the wireless service business on Wednesday through Project Fi has broad implications for Google itself, for the industry it is about to become a part of and, ultimately, for the consumers who might choose to buy in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Through partnerships with T-Mobile and Sprint, Google via Project Fi becomes what is known in the wireless industry as an MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The new phone service promises to leverage the strongest possible network based on a consumer's location, and intelligently switch from one network to another as need be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That network could be Wi-Fi, through any one of more than 1 million free public hot spots that Google has deemed kosher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google says your data will be secure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It might be Sprint's 4G LTE cellular network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And it might be T-Mobile's LTE network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The consumer isn't supposed to worry about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Of course, T-Mobile and Sprint combined are still far behind the dominant U.S. carriers, AT&T and Verizon, the 800-pound gorillas of wireless that Google will now battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>What's more, Google will be charging customers only for the data that is used, crediting back money if people consume less data than they paid for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The basic Project Fi plan costs $20 a month, which buys unlimited talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering and international coverage in more than 120 countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On top of that, consumers fork over $10 for each gigabyte of data that is used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But as Google explains, if you paid $30 for 3GB monthly but only use, say, 1.4GB of that data in a given month, the company will refund $16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Google isn't the first to adopt such a concept, but its name-brand recognition ought to bring attention to the practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Only this week, in fact, Republic Wireless announced that it would refund money to its customers for unused cellular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"That was a first and it lasted 48 hours. A win is a win," says Republic Wireless CEO David Morken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Republic Wireless $10-a-month plan is built around the notion that most calls would be handled via Wi-Fi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At the outset, Project Fi will work only with a single handset, the fine Motorola-made Nexus 6 phone that starts at $649.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Republic's service works with three Motorola phones, the Moto X, Moto G and Moto E.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Nexus 6, seen here during a media preview in New York, will initially be the only handset to work with Google's Project Fi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Motorola deserves a shout-out for driving innovation" in both plans, Morken says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>For the consumer, there are obvious questions about how Project Fi will function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Most notably, will the "handoffs" from one network to another prove to be as seamless as Google claims?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>As can be expected, Sprint and T-Mobile are publicly embracing the partnership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Sprint spokesman John Votava said in a statement that "Sprint has empowered more than 100 successful MVNOs in the US by delivering a unique combination of a robust nationwide network, differentiated services and operational support and we are proud to enable Google's entry into the wireless industry as a service provider."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In a blog post, T-Mobile's CEO John Legere said, "Project Fi is going to make people think differently about wireless - and I love that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But whatever T-Mobile and Sprint gain in the short-run, the wireless business is cutthroat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Have they invited a shark into the fish tank?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Industry analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics says Google is "clearly putting pressure on every other mobile carrier, even the ones they're partnering with. It's an ecosphere-wide competition, and I think there will be quite a few people currently with Sprint or currently with T-Mobile that would be very interested in it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Entner points out that Legere in his blog post made mention of a couple of T-Mobile technologies that will not be part of Project Fi, notably HD Voice, and "next-gen Wi-Fi Calling for seamless handoffs between LTE and Wi-Fi."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Would-be Project Fi customers will be able to port over their current phone numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>And Google says folks who request an invite to try the service should hear back within 30 days.</td></tr>
