<h3>Greek Finance Minister Angered Over Missing Copy of Bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis attends a parliament session before the vote of an anti-poverty bill, the first piece of legislation from the left-wing government, in Athens, on Wednesday, March 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tsipras insisted Wednesday his government will honor an election promise to end budget austerity - a note of defiance ahead of an expected meeting with the leaders of Germany and France on the country's troubled bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece's finance minister says a copy of the country's original bailout agreement was missing from the ministry when he took over nearly two months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Speaking in parliament Thursday, Yanis Varoufakis said he felt "almost infinite anger" when told that a copy of the agreement was not available, adding that one was located three and a half days after he made the request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He blamed a tradition in Greece of ministers taking key documents with them when they leave office, and promised to change the rules to stop the practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Varoufakis spoke before the Greek prime minister was to hold emergency talks in Brussels with lead lenders over the country's troubled bailout negotiations.</td></tr>
