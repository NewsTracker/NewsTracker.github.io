<h3>Hungry? Google it to get delivery</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>You're a busy person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google gets that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Who has time to search for the best meal in town, investigate a restaurant's website and travel to a totally different page to place a takeout or delivery order?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Not you, that's whom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now, when a restaurant shows up in Google's search results on your phone, you can place an order with one of six different restaurant middlemen right away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google shared this information in a brief post on its Google+ page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The news is about as straightforward as it gets: Do a Google search, find a restaurant, scroll down and select "place an order," located right under the option to see a restaurant's menu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>From there, you can choose one of six different services to place a takeout or delivery order with the restaurant: Seamless, Grubhub, Eat24, Delivery.com, BeyondMenu and MyPizza.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Of course, not every restaurant will be available through every provider, and some will not be available through any of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The good news is that these six intermediaries are only Google's first volley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The company promises to add more as the service grows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Either way, placing orders directly from search results may act as a kick in the pants to purveyors of comestibles that don't yet offer ordering through apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Bing search added a similar feature in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Right now, the service is only available in the United States, but if it takes off, it's reasonable to think that other countries will adopt it as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>To try it for yourself, just make sure your Google smartphone app is up to date, search for a restaurant (or a type of food with your location turned on), and see what comes up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>You'll be in possession of a fast, hot meal and back to whatever else you were doing in no time, you busy person, you.</td></tr>
