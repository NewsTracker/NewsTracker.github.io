<h3>Cyclone Nathan affecting Elcho Island</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Bureau of Meteorology says Nathan was estimated to be about 50 kilometres north northwest of Galiwinku with wind gust up to 140km/h late on Sunday, and its destructive core of sustained winds of around 120km/h continuing to impact Elcho Island for several hours into Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nathan was moving northwest at 12km/h and is set to increase in intensity to a category three level now that it is over open water, as it moves along the coast on Monday, before turning southwest toward land later in the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Elcho Island was severely damaged by Cyclone Law in late February, and a storm tide, with damaging waves and dangerous flooding, was also expected between Elcho Island and Cape Shield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier, the Bureau said Nathan would remain a category three cyclone into the latter part of Monday, then hopefully weaken to a category one or two system before making landfall again around Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Gales may extend further west to Milingimbi and Maningrida early on Monday and may extend west to Croker Island overnight Monday or Tuesday morning if the system takes a more westerly track," the BoM said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Gales may extend further west to Cape Don and Point Stuart during Tuesday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The cyclone intensified to a "high end" category two on Sunday, crossing the coast between Nhulunbuy and Cape Shield in the morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Residents from Cape Shield to Alyangula are being told it is now safe to leave shelter areas, but to wear strong clothing and footwear, and be aware of fallen power lines and debris.</td></tr>
