<h3>China shares pause for GDP test, euro pressured</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SYDNEY, April 14 (Reuters) - Chinese shares fought to sustain yet another seven-year peak on Tuesday a day before the country updates on economic growth, while much of the rest of Asia took a breather after recent hefty gains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A surprise decision by Singapore's central bank not to ease policy gave a boost to emerging currencies in the region, while the euro touched lows on the yen not seen since mid-2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>China's central bank continued to slowly relax its policy by guiding short-term money market rates lower for the fifth time since the Lunar New Year in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Asian giant reports gross domestic product for the first quarter on Wednesday and there are risks it could disappoint after poor trade news this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Caution set in after an early jump and Shanghai stocks faded 0.2 percent, having climbed almost uninterrupted for more than five weeks now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hong Kong's main index, which touched a seven-year high on Monday and rose 12 percent in the past five sessions, dipped 1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.3 percent to 512, shying away from September's top of 516.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A break there would take it to ground last trod in early 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Likewise, Japan's Nikkei dithered around 19,900, having struggled to sustain a break above the 20,000 barrier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Wall Street, investors had fretted that a strong dollar would constrain earnings at multinational corporations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Dow ended Monday down 0.45 percent, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.46 percent and the Nasdaq 0.15 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Estimates for first-quarter S&P 500 results have fallen sharply since Jan. 1, with earnings for the period expected to have declined 2.9 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Eyes are also on U.S. retail sales data due later Tuesday for evidence that spending is picking up after a sluggish start to the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An upbeat result would add to the case for rate hikes from the Federal Reserve later this year, and support the dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The yen made gains of its own after Koichi Hamada, an economic adviser to Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, indicated the yen was excessively weak against the dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The euro led the way lower with a drop to 126.35 yen, depths not visited since June 2013 and the sixth straight session of losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The dollar decline was mild in contrast as it drifted off to 119.83 yen, from an early 120.10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The euro also eased to $1.0543, from an early rise to $1.0570, having fallen as low as $1.0519 on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was up 0.1 percent at 99.637 and not far from recent peaks.</td></tr>
