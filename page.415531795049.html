<h3>State: No record of Clinton signing separation statement</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that Clinton's two immediate predecessors, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, had not signed such a statement either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Psaki said there was no sign of such a statement in department files.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We're fairly certain she didn't sign one," Psaki told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Psaki said that even though it was "not clear" that such statements were used throughout the federal government or even inside the State Department, she said that department officials were still trying to assess whether Clinton and former secretaries of State should have signed the documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The State Department requires employees leaving the diplomatic service to fill out an official statement - known as form OF-109 - acknowledging that they have turned over all classified and unclassified records of government business to "responsible officials."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Psaki said that different bureaus within the department had varying rules relating to such statements, effectively making it optional for some employees to fill them out and turn them in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She could not identify the bureaus in which employees had such a choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Questions about whether Clinton signed such a document have swirled since the revelation of her use of a personal email account for government-related work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Republicans and other critics have said that the State Department, along with other federal agencies, generally requires outgoing employees to turn over job-related materials before leaving - and that Clinton also should have met that standard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Federal policy generally requires employees to sign such separation statements declaring they have turned over all documents relating to official business during their employment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Providing incorrect information on the form can be grounds for prosecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The office of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement on Tuesday that it would be "a big problem if she signed that form like she was supposed to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Others have said it would be equally troubling if Clinton did not sign the form because that would have meant she would was holding herself to a different standard than other employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Psaki said that Clinton's failure to sign such a statement was "not a violation of any rule" and did not risk any department punishments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She noted that "there are differences between regulations and recommendations," and added that "we're not aware of any penalty for not signing it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The OF-109 form lists several U.S. Criminal Code violations involving classified materials and government records but does not cite a warning for failing to sign the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Guidance from the National Archives and Records Administration says that personal files may be removed by departing federal officials but that "if you are unsure whether materials are personal or federal records, consult with the agency records officer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>NARA also says that "when determining whether to permit departing officials to remove documentary materials, the agency should also consider the extent to which such removal could affect the agency's ability to invoke various legal privileges."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Other agencies have specific rules governing the removal of government files.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Department of Homeland Security, for example, advises that agency records officials will obtain "signed removal forms" from all presidential appointees and that "records will not be disposed of while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, subpoena or lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act or the Privacy Act."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Republican National Committee earlier Tuesday submitted two Freedom of Information requests to the State Department seeking copies of the "separation statements" signed by Clinton and her top aides and related records.</td></tr>

<h3>Oil exporters amass record U.S. bond holdings in crude price plunge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Saudi Arabia and other major oil exporters have increased their holdings of U.S. Treasuries to record levels in an effort to counter the effect of the 60 percent drop in oil prices in the last nine months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Global financial assets such as U.S. Treasuries, corporate debt, and equities have benefited from soaring oil prices over the last decade as producers funneled their oil windfall into these markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With the dollar hovering near a 12-year peak against a basket of currencies, OPEC and oil exporters are hedging the drop in their oil income from profits on a rising greenback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Crude prices fell to a six-year low this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Oil exporters' holdings of U.S. Treasuries grew to a record $290.80 billion in January from $285.9 billion in December, according to U.S. Treasury data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There is a strong portfolio argument for oil producers to use long dollar exposure as a partial hedge against weaker oil prices, not to mention the need for dollar reserves to help protect dollar pegs," said Alan Ruskin, global head of currency strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Since June, those nations' Treasuries holdings have risen 12 percent, slightly faster than the 10 percent pace in the first six months of 2014 when oil prices, which are priced in U.S. dollars, were running above $100 a barrel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"These oil exporters are getting more defensive. They're probably reducing their equity exposure and moving to more liquid investments such as U.S. Treasuries in anticipation that they might need to run down their reserves," said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, global market strategist at JP Morgan's global asset allocation group in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said that if oil prices drop, these countries' reserves would be used to stabilize their currencies in order to hold down the domestic costs of imported goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They're also probably trying to ride the strong dollar trend," Panigirtzoglou said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Panigirtzoglou expects oil exporters to buy fewer global bonds for the rest of this year, including U.S. Treasuries, as oil revenues shrink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>J.P. Morgan, in a research report, said it expects oil revenues from oil producers to decline to $750 billion this year, assuming an average oil price of $50 per barrel, from $1.5 trillion in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Last year, J.P. Morgan estimated the average oil price to be $100 per barrel.</td></tr>
