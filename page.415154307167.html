<h3>Carlile warms to 'Firewatcher's Daughter'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rock 'n' roll boasts few songs about missed chances to offer hospitality, but this one fits right into The Firewatcher's Daughter (* * * out of four) and its desperate desire for relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That desire manifests itself in such love songs as I Belong to You and Wilder (We're Chained), as well as in the tight-knit, three-part harmonies Carlile sings with her longtime collaborators, twin brothers Tim and Phil Hanseroth, on Eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Between the recording of Carlile's last album, 2012's Bear Creek and now, she and the Hanseroths all have become parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>So while her songs have always possessed a spiritual quality, going back to such numbers as The Story or Bear Creek's That Wasn't Me, on The Firewatcher's Daughter, now she's examining the bonds that hold people together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sometimes, those bonds seem loose, as they do on single Wherever Is Your Heart, where home isn't so much a physical location as it is the heart of a distant love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At other times, they seem unbreakable: In Wilder, Carlile sings of the connection between a parent and child as a chain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Maybe I was meant to be under your lock and key," she sings in the quiet and lovely Beginning to Feel the Years, which has a melody that builds with Roy Orbison's sense of drama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Carlile has made some polished music during her 10-year recording career, including a 2011 live album recorded with the Seattle Symphony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But The Firewatcher's Daughter has a unfettered excitement, whether it's on the Fleetwood Mac-like fingerpicked folk-pop of Wilder or on Mainstream Kid, which sports the recklessness and reverb of rockabilly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In Alibi, Carlile has a conspiratorial gleam in her eye as she sings, "If you're good at telling lies, you could be my alibi, and I won't have to atone for my sins."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The sole cover, a remake of the Avett Brothers' Murder in the City, suits the tone of the album, with its pleas to forgo revenge in favor of expressing love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In the face of death, or simply when encountering a stranger in need, The Firewatcher's Daughter is an album with a big heart, one that responds with love, not fear.</td></tr>

<h3>'The threat exists': Vatican on alert for Islamic State attack, says security chief</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rome: The Vatican is on alert in case of an attack by Islamist militants against the city-state or Pope Francis, but officials are not aware of any specific plot, the head of Vatican security said in a rare interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The threat exists. This is what has emerged from conversations with Italian and foreign colleagues," Domenico Giani told Polizia Moderna, the magazine published by Italian police, when asked if threats from Islamic State militants were credible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"(But) at the moment I can say that we are not aware of any plan to attack the Vatican or the Holy Father," he added in the interview, published on the magazine's website on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A Swiss Guard on patrol at the start of the General Audience with the Pope, attended by thousands of people in St Peter's Square at the Vatican.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Islamic State militants have made threats against Catholic targets in Rome that have been given much space in Italian media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last month, in a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya, one of the killers said: "Safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for ... We will conquer Rome, by the will of Allah."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A website used by militants ran a photo montage showing the movement's black flag flying from the obelisk at the centre of St Peter's Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Executing Christians ... Members of the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group parade down a street in Libya's coastal city of Sirte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Giani said the alert level was "constantly high" in and around the tiny city-state, which sits inside Rome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His force of some 130 agents, along with the more ceremonial Swiss Guard, protect most of the Vatican and the pope, while Italian police guard the exterior, as well as St Peter's Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last month, in the wake of killings by Islamist militants in Paris and Copenhagen, 4800 soldiers were placed on the streets throughout Italy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Protecting the Pope ... A member of the Swiss Guard closes the gate at the Arch of the Bells at St Peter's Basilica.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Francis has several times condemned attacks by Islamic militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Sunday, he called for an end to their "intolerable brutality".</td></tr>
