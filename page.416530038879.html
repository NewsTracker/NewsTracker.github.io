<h3>Magnitude 6.7 aftershock hits Nepal, causes panic</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - A powerful aftershock shook Nepal on Sunday, making buildings sway and sending panicked Kathmandu residents running into the streets a day after a massive earthquake left at least 1,900 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The cawing of crows mixed with terrified screams as the aftershock pummeled the capital city early Sunday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At magnitude 6.7, it was strong enough to feel like an another earthquake, and came as planeloads of supplies, doctors and relief workers from neighboring countries began arriving in this poor Himalayan nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Saturday's magnitude 7.8 earthquake reached from Kathmandu to small villages and to the slopes of Mount Everest, triggering an avalanche that buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers preparing to make their summit attempts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At least 17 people died there and 61 were injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An elderly injured woman is taken home through earthquake debris after treatment in Bhaktapur near Kathmandu, Nepal, Sunday, April 26, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A strong magnitude 7.8 earthquake shook Nepal's capital and the densely populated Kathmandu Valley before noon Saturday, causing extensive damage with toppled walls and collapsed buildings, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The earthquake centered outside Kathmandu, the capital, was the worst to hit the South Asian nation in over 80 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It destroyed swaths of the oldest neighborhoods of Kathmandu, and was strong enough to be felt all across parts of India, Bangladesh, China's region of Tibet and Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>By Sunday morning, authorities said at least 1,970 people had died, all but 60 of them in Nepal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At least 721 of them died in Kathmandu alone, and the number of injured nationwide was upward of 5,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But outside of the oldest neighborhoods, many in Kathmandu were surprised by how few modern structures - the city is largely a collection of small, poorly constructed brick apartment buildings - collapsed in the quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While aid workers cautioned that many buildings could have sustained serious structural damage, it was also clear that the death toll would have been far higher had more buildings caved in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On a flight into Kathmandu on Sunday morning, an AP correspondent was unable to spot any collapsed buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Aid workers also warned that the situation could be far worse near the epicenter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was centered near Lamjung, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu, in the Gorkha district.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Roads to that area were blocked by landslides, hindering rescue teams, said chief district official Prakash Subedi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Teams were trekking through mountain trails to reach remote villages, and helicopters would also be deployed, he said by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The aid group World Vision said in a statement that remote mountain communities, including in Gorkha, were totally unprepared for the level of destruction caused by the earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Villages near the epicenter "are literally perched on the sides of large mountain faces and are made from simple stone and rock construction. Many of these villages are only accessible by 4WD and then foot, with some villages hours and even entire days' walks away from main roads at the best of times," the group's local staff member, Matt Darvas, said in the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said he was hearing that many of the villages may have been completely buried by rock falls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It will likely be helicopter access only for these remote villages," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Nepal's worst recorded earthquake in 1934 measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>With people fearing more quakes, tens of thousands of Nepalese spent Saturday night outside under chilly skies, and were jolted awake by strong aftershocks early Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"There were at least three big quakes at night and early morning. How can we feel safe? This is never-ending and everyone is scared and worried," said Kathmandu resident Sundar Sah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I hardly got much sleep. I was waking up every few hours and glad that I was alive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>As day broke, rescuers aided by international teams set out to dig through rubble of buildings - concrete slabs, bricks, iron beams, wood - to look for survivors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Most areas were without power and water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The United Nations said hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded, and running out of emergency supplies and space to store corpses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Plumes of smoke, meanwhile, rose above the capital as friends, relatives and others gathered by the river to quickly cremate loved ones' remains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In the Kalanki neighborhood, police rescuers finally extricated a man lying under a dead person, both of them buried beneath a pile of concrete slabs and iron beams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Before his rescue, his family members stood nearby, crying and praying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Police said the man's legs and hips were totally crushed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this impoverished country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>With Kathmandu airport reopened, the first aid flights began delivering aid supplies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The first to respond were Nepal's neighbors - India, China and Pakistan, all of which have been jockeying for influence over the landlocked nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Still, Nepal remains closest to India with which it shares deep political, cultural and religious ties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Indian air force planes landed Sunday with 43 tons of relief material, including tents and food, and nearly 200 rescuers, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The planes were returning to New Delhi with Indian nationals stranded in Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>More aid flights were planned for Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>A 62-member Chinese search and rescue team also arrived Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Pakistan prepared to send four C-130 aircraft, carrying a 30-bed temporary hospital comprising army doctors, surgeons and specialists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>An urban search and rescue team was also sent with ground-penetrating radars, concrete cutters and sniffing dogs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Pakistan was also sending 2,000 ready-to-eat meal packs, water bottles, medicines, 200 tents, 600 blankets and other necessary items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>When the earth first shook, residents fled homes and buildings in panic as walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>After the chaos of Saturday - when little organized rescue and relief was seen - there was more order on Sunday as rescue teams fanned out across the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Workers were sending out tents and relief goods in trucks and helicopters, said disaster management official Rameshwar Dangal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>He said government and private schools have been turned into shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Mukesh Kafle, the head of the Nepal Electricity Authority, said power has been restored fully to main government offices, the airport and hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Among the destroyed buildings in Kathmandu was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, a Kathmandu landmark built by Nepal's royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The Kathmandu Valley is listed as a World Heritage site.</td></tr>
