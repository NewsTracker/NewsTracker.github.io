<h3>Carrasco loses no-hitter with 1 strike to go in 9th vs Rays (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Carlos Carrasco was one strike away from throwing Cleveland's first no-hitter in 34 years and already considering ways to celebrate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A bit prematurely it turned out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The right-hander gave up an RBI single to Joey Butler over leaping second baseman Jason Kipnis' glove in an 8-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It's part of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I was excited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>... I started thinking about what I needed to do, throw my glove in the air or something,'' Carrasco said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''It was great.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For the third straight night, the Indians took a perfect game into the sixth inning against the Rays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This time, Carrasco retired the first 19 batters before walking Butler with one out in the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Washington's Max Scherzer lost a perfect game with one strike to go on June 20, but he finished with a no-hitter, the second in the major leagues this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Carrasco walked Asdrubal Cabrera leading off the ninth, then struck pinch-hitter Brandon Guyer with a pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Grady Sizemore, also pinch hitting, grounded into a force play and Kevin Kiermaier struck out to bring Butler to the plate with a crowd of 11,394 at Tropicana Field on its feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Butler lined an 0-2 slider over the 5-foot-11 Kipnis, who jumped high in the air to make an attempt at catching the ball and fell flat to the ground as the line drive landed cleanly in the outfield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''If Kip was 6-6, maybe (he'd have caught it),'' Indians manager Terry Francona said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''He left me a pitch to hit and I did what I could with it,'' Butler, a 29-year-old rookie who was in a 2-for-19 tailspin before that at-bat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''It's pretty discouraging when you get no-hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Carrasco smiled, clapped into his glove several times and pointed at the second baseman in appreciation of his effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The 28-year-old right-hander was lifted after his career-high 124th pitch and Austin Adams got the final out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Carrasco received pats on the back and hugs in the dugout after his 13 strikeout performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''I just started laughing,'' said Carrasco, who has a home in nearby Tarpon Springs, Florida, and estimated he had about 25 family members and friends at the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The last Indians' pitcher to throw a no-hitter was Len Barker, who had a perfect game against Toronto on May 15, 1981.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>For the third straight night and fourth time in seven games, the light-hitting Rays failed to get a baserunner until after the fifth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Toronto's Marco Estrada took a perfect game into the eighth inning before Logan Forsythe broke up the bid with an infield single a week ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Sizemore broke up Cody Anderson's pursuit of perfection with a seventh-inning home run Monday, and Curt Casali doubled for the first hit off Cleveland's Danny Salazar in the sixth on Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''I think you saw from the start he had incredible stuff going and when you're running into a lineup that's been scuffling a little bit, those things have a chance of happening,'' Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Facing the Rays less than two weeks after yielding 10 hits over 6 2-3 innings of a 4-1 loss to Tampa Bay, Carrasco breezed into the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>After walking Butler, Evan Longoria hit a sharp grounder to first baseman Carlos Santana, who stepped on the bag and tagged Butler out in a rundown between first and second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Brandon Moss homered and drove in five runs for the Indians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He had a two-run double off Alex Colome (3-4) in the second and a three-run homer off C.J. Riefenhauser in the eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Jason Kipnis, Michael Brantley and David Murphy also drove in runs for Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Indians: Manager Francona said there is no timetable for when OF Nick Swisher (knee) could return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Swisher is running in the outfield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Rays: RHP Jake Odorizzi (oblique) gave up one run over four innings in a rehab start for Class A Charlotte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>... 1B James Loney (broken left middle finger) had two hits for Charlotte and appears close to returning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Indians: 2014 AL Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber (3-9) will start Thursday's series finale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He is 1-5 with a 4.00 ERA in nine road starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Rays: 2013 AL All-Star Matt Moore will make his first start since elbow ligament replacement surgery last year on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The left-hander hasn't pitched in the majors since April 7, 2013 at Kansas City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>''I'm anxious, I'm excited,'' Moore said.</td></tr>
