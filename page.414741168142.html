<tr><td>9</td><td>"Laugh-In" creator and producer George Schlatter, who knew Owens but said he hired him for the show after hearing his voice boom through a restaurant restroom, called him a "lovely, lovely man."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He had a whimsical, fey sense of humor and he brought a lot to 'Laugh-In' in the way of thoughts, words and jokes," Schlatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Given Owens' jam-packed resume, was he a workaholic?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Gary did not work. Gary played," Schlatter said.</td></tr>
