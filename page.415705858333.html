<h3>U.S. says would review any Iraqi request for help in Tikrit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Certainly, if the Iraqis formally request U.S. assistance, we would take a look at that," Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren told a news briefing, declining to say whether Baghdad had already submitted such a request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Reuters reported on Tuesday that Iraq's request to the U.S.-led coalition for air strikes in the campaign to retake Tikrit from Islamic State insurgents was imminent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If the coalition accepts such a request, it would see by far the biggest collaboration so far against the militants by Iraqi forces, the Iranian-backed paramilitary's and their Iranian advisers on the ground, and the United States and its allies.</td></tr>
