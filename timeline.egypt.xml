    <title>&lt;p&gt;Cairo: Egypt's parliamentary poll looks set to be delayed after a court ruled part of an election law was unconstitutional and the main election committee said it was working on a new timetable for the long-awaited vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest development highlights Egypt's rocky path towards democracy since the ousting of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 by the army after mass protests against the rule of Egypt's first democratically elected leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt has been without a parliament since June 2012 when a court dissolved the democratically elected main chamber, reversing a major accomplishment of the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;Calling for an international coalition to confront the insurgency on its border, Egypt confirmed it had conducted raids in the IS-stronghold of Derna, in Libya's east, backed by Libya's air force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Egyptian air force fighter jet lands at an undisclosed location in Egypt following air strikes in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 64 militants were killed in Egypt's attacks, Libyan Air Force commander Saqer al-Joroushi told Egyptian state television, indicating further air strikes were planned for Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grief ... A man is comforted as he mourns the Egyptian Coptic Christians who were captured in Libya and beheaded by Islamic State jihadists, outside of the Virgin Mary church in the village of el-Aour, Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Egypt, already fighting a terrorist insurgency in north Sinai against an IS-affiliated militia, the dangers of being drawn into the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Libya are enormous, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;CAIRO: Egypt said it bombed Islamic State targets inside Libya, a day after the group released a video appearing to show the beheading of 21 Egyptians there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first time Egypt confirmed launching air strikes against the group in Libya, suggesting President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is ready to escalate his battle against militants seeking to topple his government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya said it had joined and co-ordinated with Egypt on the strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt's military said the dawn strike hit Islamic State camps, training sites and weapons storage areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a phone call to Al Arabiya television, Brigadier Saqer al-Joroushi, the commander of the air force loyal to Libya's official government, said more air strikes would be carried out in co-ordination with Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt, the most populous Arab state, has not taken part directly in the US-led air strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, focusing instead on the increasingly complex insurgency within its own borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with Sinai Province, a group operating from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;The airstrikes bring Egypt overtly into Libya's turmoil, a reflection of Cairo's increasing alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt now faces threats on two fronts " a growing stronghold of radicals on its western border and a militant insurgency of Islamic State allies on its eastern flank in the Sinai Peninsula " as well as its own internal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement on state radio represents Egypt's first public acknowledgement of military action in post-Moammar Gadhafi Libya, where there has been almost no government control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen of the 21 came from Egypt's tiny Christian-majority village of el-Aour, where relatives wept in church and shouted the names of the dead on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without publicly acknowledging it, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates carried out airstrikes against Islamist-allied militias last year, according to U.S. officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt already has been amassing intelligence on extremists in Libya in a joint effort with the Libyan armed forces and West European nations, including France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France, a lead player in the campaign to oust Gadhafi, has campaigned for months for some kind of international action in Libya, and announced a deal Monday to sell fighter jets to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;Morsi, overthrown in July 2013 following mass protests demanding his resignation, does not recognize the court, and insists Egypt's current leadership came to power in a coup d'etat and is thus illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was Egypt's first democratically elected leader, but his turbulent one-year rule left the country sharply divided.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;Baher was initially sentenced to 10 years in prison and Fahmy to seven years but Egypt's top appeals court subsequently ordered a retrial after overturning the initial ruling, citing "flawed evidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Al-Jazeera reporters spent over 400 days in prison after being caught in the bitter feud between Egypt and Qatar, main backer of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood group, from which ousted President Mohammed Morsi hails.&lt;/p&gt;</title>
