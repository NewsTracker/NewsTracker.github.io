<h3>Egypt to try police officer for killing female protester</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The death of 32-year old Shaimaa el-Sabbagh, a mother of a young boy, in January on the eve of the 2011 uprising's anniversary caused an intense public outcry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Despite widely circulated footage that showed two masked, black-clad policemen pointing their rifles in el-Sabbagh's direction as gunshots rang out and a voice commanded "fire," authorities initially denied that police had any involvement in her death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Barely two weeks later, at least 22 soccer fans were crushed to death outside a stadium in Cairo after police fired tear gas to break up the crowd waiting in a narrow corridor to enter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police accused the fans of attacking the force, and rioting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FILE - In this Saturday, Jan. 24, 2015 photo, 32-year-old mother Shaimaa el-Sabbagh holds a poster during a protest in downtown Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>s chief prosecutor has referred a police officer to trial for the deadly shooting of a female protester killed earlier this year during a peaceful demonstration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Tuesday, the chief prosecutor general also referred 16 fans to trial, accusing them of belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The statement said the defendants confessed to receiving money to plot the chaos outside the stadium in order to destabilize the country and cause a recent international donor conference hosted by Egypt to fail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The group, which includes 12 people already in detention, is charged with premeditated murder, sabotage, resisting authorities and possession of explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The prosecutor's office said in a statement that it was acting as an "honest broker" in the highly-emotional cases that have captured public opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The two cases had renewed accusations from rights groups and political activists that Egypt's powerful police force enjoys almost blanket impunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Amnesty International said authorities in Egypt are covering up excessive use of force by police, taking no action to rein in abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Almost all of the over 100 policemen tried for killing protesters during Egypt's 2011 revolution were acquitted, with judges citing shoddy investigation or lax evidence in cases largely probed by the police themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Authorities have increased the crackdown on dissent following the military ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013, accusing his supporters of being behind the violence that has gripped Egypt, including in the Sinai Peninsula, and against security forces nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The uproar over el-Sabbagh's death prompted Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to urge an investigation but he hinted that individual mistakes should not undermine public confidence in the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The interior minister at the time of her death has since been replaced in a Cabinet shuffle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Chief prosecutor Hisham Barakat said in a statement that the investigation revealed el-Sabbagh died from birdshot fired toward her and other protesters by an officer ordered to disperse the protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Barakat charged one police officer with involuntary manslaughter, punishable by up to seven years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>No trial date has been set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>El-Sabbagh's family lawyer Mohammed Abdel-Aziz said authorities had denied him access to the investigation or the right to attend the interrogations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In an indication of how the case may proceed, Barakat said the protesters were holding an illegal gathering, without prior permission from the authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He referred an undetermined number of protest organizers from el-Sabbagh's political party to trial for violating a draconian 2013 law that bans unauthorized protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Abdel-Aziz said he was informed by prosecutors that some 13 members of el-Sabbagh's party, the Popular Alliance, were referred to trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In a third case, the chief prosecutor closed the debate over the death of a young activist who disappeared following a 2013 protest in Tahrir square, only to surface days later in a hospital in a coma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Barakat ruled out previous accounts that Mohammed el-Gindy died from torture while held in a security camp, referring a witness to the account to trial for "spreading false news that endangers public interest," and asserting that the young activist died in a car accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The witness had said he saw el-Gindy held in a security camp where he was tortured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"This is a disaster for all the torture cases. No one would want to come testify now for fear of being referred to trial," Abdel-Aziz, who was also the lawyer for el-Gindy, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Abdel-Aziz said the compiled list of referrals by the prosecutor suggests authorities are trying to deflect renewed public anger by passing multiple controversial cases through the system at once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"It is suggesting authorities are neutral, investigating cases against police and at the same time, get off in the stadium violence and el-Gindy's case," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>FILE - In this Thursday, Jan. 29, 2015 file photo, an Egyptian protester holds a poster of Shaimaa el-Sabbagh, an activist who was shot dead at a small peaceful protest, with Arabic that reads, "how many martyrs remaining for victory," during a women's protest in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>FILE - In this Sunday, Feb. 8, 2015 file photo, an Ultras White Knights soccer fan cries during a match between Egyptian Premier League clubs Zamalek and ENPPI at the Air Defense Stadium in a suburb east of Cairo, Egypt.</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>Police accused the fans of attacking the force, and rioting to enter the stadium.</td></tr>

<h3>Russia to send new missiles to Baltic exclave on maneuvers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Russian military exercises this week range from the Arctic to the Pacific Ocean and involve tens of thousands of troops, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Iskander missiles will be sent to the Kaliningrad region that borders NATO members Poland and Lithuania as part of the maneuvers, said a Defense Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to comment publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The official also said Russia will deploy long-range, nuclear-capable Tu-22M3 bombers to Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a statement, the Defense Ministry said the Baltic Fleet, the Southern Military District and the Airborne Forces have been brought to the highest stage of combat readiness and have started moving to shooting ranges as part of the drills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The wide-ranging exercise started Monday, when President Vladimir Putin ordered the Northern Fleet and other military forces on combat alert as part of the exercise in the Arctic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Other units in the Pacific region, southern Siberia and southwestern Russia also launched drills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Iskander missiles deployment to Kaliningrad reflects Moscow's readiness to raise the ante in response to NATO moves to deploy forces closer to Russia's borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The missiles, which are capable of hitting enemy targets up to 500 kilometers (310 miles away) with high precision, can be equipped with a nuclear or a conventional warhead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>From Kaliningrad, they could reach several NATO member states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz interpreted the move as an attempt by Russia to pressure EU nations as they consider possible new sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Russia is making this gesture before the European Council meeting," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It is trying to influence European Council decisions concerning extending or adding new sanctions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics of Latvia, which holds the EU presidency, said Tuesday he did not expect "a discussion of new sanctions or any decisions" when EU leaders meet Thursday in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Igor Sutyagin, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute, said beefing up forces in the Baltic exclave was a top priority for the Russian military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Iskander missiles already had been sent briefly to Kaliningrad during December's military maneuvers, but were pulled back afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme commander in Europe, has termed Russia's "threats to deploy nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles in Kaliningrad" part of what he called the Kremlin's "pattern of continuing behavior to coerce its neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Kremlin, in its turn, has voiced concern about U.S. plans to beef up its military presence near Russia's borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Later this month, U.S. troops are holding joint exercises with forces from EU nations Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Four Polish NATO MiG-29s flew training missions in Lithuania on Monday, under the command and control of an alliance AWACS surveillance aircraft in a small corridor between Belarus and the Kaliningrad region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The mission - described as 'routine' by NATO officials - prompted the Russian military in Kaliningrad to scramble half a dozen fighter jets to monitor the exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Monday's AWACS mission was flying from Oerland airbase, near Trondheim in Norway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The AWACS flights were part of efforts to reassure NATO members in eastern Europe, in particular the Baltic states, which are concerned about Russia's intentions amid the Ukrainian crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Polish Defense Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said Tuesday that a battery of U.S. anti-aircraft Patriot missiles will be coming to Poland later this month for a major exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He previously said 10,000 foreign troops will be taking part in NATO exercises in Poland this year, the highest number ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Monika Scislowska in Warsaw, John-Thor Dahlburg in Brussels and David Keyton aboard a NATO AWACS plane contributed to this report.</td></tr>
