<h3>Asia stocks fall, euro drifts down as Greek crisis deepens</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TOKYO Asian stocks fell on Friday as Greece failed again to reach an agreement with its creditors and stumbled towards a default, while major currencies like the euro and dollar drifted in narrow ranges as the debt saga sidelined investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Financial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE to open down 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX .GDAXI as much as 0.2 percent lower and France's CAC 40 .FCHI 0.4 percent lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"European equities are set to slide on the open once more as Greek talks draw another blank," Jonathan Sudaria, a dealer at Capital Spreads, said in a note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last-ditch talks by euro zone finance ministers will resume on Saturday to either avert a Greek default next week or start preparing for a "Plan B" to protect the euro zone from financial market turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Athens has to repay the International Monetary Fund 1.6 billion euros ($1.79 billion) on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are saying, not without careful thought, that this Eurogroup is of decisive importance, taking into account that time is very short and that a result must be worked on," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference early on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A breakdown in talks on Thursday again revealed the wide gap in understanding between Greece and its creditors, highlighting the prospect that neither side may accept any proposed concessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Commentators also pointed to the fact that the German parliament has to ratify any changes first before paying for a bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Greek exit from the euro zone will be inevitable if Athens and its lenders do not come up with a solution within the next five days, Germany's EU Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We will do everything up until the 30th so that the Greeks show they are prepared to reform," Oettinger told Deutschlandfunk radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"A 'Grexit' is not our aim but would be unavoidable if there is no solution in the next five days," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The ongoing uncertainty pressured shares across Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was down 1 percent in late afternoon trade, but still on track for a small weekly rise of 0.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Japan's Nikkei .N225 ended down 0.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Despite household spending rising more than expected, inflation has remained flat, keeping alive expectations for more central bank stimulus later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Volatile Chinese stocks, which often march to their own drum beat, tumbled for a second day as the market struggled to digest a flood of IPOs, tighter cash supply and confusion about government and central bank policy direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The CSI300 index .CSI300 of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen and the Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC were both down more than 6 percent in afternoon trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Australian shares .AXJO lost 1.5 percent, while South Korea's Kospi .KS11 bucked the trend and gained 0.4 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In currencies, the euro inched down 0.1 percent to $1.1188 EUR=, stuck within a tight $1.1235-1153 range for the third session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It was poised to end the week about 1.4 percent lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The dollar JPY= nudged down 0.2 percent to 123.33 yen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>With Greece in the spotlight once again, upbeat U.S. data that could have otherwise lifted the dollar by fanning hopes for a rate hike by the Federal Reserve was relegated to the background.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Figures on Thursday showed U.S. consumer spending recorded its largest increase in nearly six years in May, further evidence that economic growth was accelerating in the second quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In commodities trading, U.S. crude added about 0.2 percent to $59.81 a barrel CLc1 after finishing Thursday down almost 1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Traders and investors are very much on tenterhooks on the outcome (of talks on Greece)," said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at OptionsXpress in Sydney.</td></tr>
