<h3>Misery, tuberculosis in prisons of war-torn east Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Talk in the prison is that inmates ate them when food deliveries stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Medical supplies have also been in short supply, threatening the lives of nearly 400 prisoners who need treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The principal scourge: tuberculosis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The disease spreads prodigiously in jails and develops into hard-to-treat forms unless properly addressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"TB is so common within the penitentiary system that many inmates don't see it as a deadly disease - they see catching TB as a normal part of life in prison," Doctors Without Borders said in a recent report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Some even tell us they don't care if they die or not."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The gray, squat, three-story building stands inside a perimeter lined with barbed wire and observation towers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Zhdanivka has since last year been under the control of the armed Russian-backed separatists who established the would-be breakaway state of the Donetsk People's Republic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Supplies from the Ukrainian government have ground to a halt - and the ragtag rebel authorities have been at a loss to fill shortfalls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prison authorities allowed Associated Press journalists to visit the hospital at the Zhdanivka prison last week, albeit under close supervision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The deputy prison director, dressed in a military-style uniform and seated under a black-blue-and-red Donetsk People's Republic flag, coldly explained the rules: No walking without escort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>No contact with prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>No filming of prison walls or towers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After being handed sanitary masks and passes, visitors entered detention wings while being followed closely by a prison minder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The minder frequently restricted AP movements: "You cannot film there".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Don't go there, repair work going on".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"That employee is off-limits."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Most prisoners were friendly and happy to talk, but were prevented from doing so by wardens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"My folks probably think I'm dead by now," says one prisoner, before the conversation is cut short by a minder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The only prisoners unwilling to speak were in Block 3 - a group of around 70 who rejected medical treatment in protest who said they are afraid doctors are testing unregistered drugs on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Responsibility for treating inmates in the underfunded prison shifted as early as 2011 to organizations like Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But the group's role - and its burden - has grown sharply since war broke out last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>MSF says 170 patients under treatment at five pre-detention centers and jails in areas surrounding the conflict zone have developed drug-resistant TB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Janette Olson, field coordinator of the MSF multidrug-resistant TB program, said prisoners are refusing to take drugs with unpleasant side effects, making long-term treatment complicated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>MSF says that while the official death rate from tuberculosis in Ukraine is 15 per 100,000 people, the number is 10 times higher among prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A church built by prisoners sits behind the walls of the jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Sick inmates go there daily to pray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Few distractions ease the monotony of life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Prisoners float like ghosts through the unlit corridors of the hospital and prison wards.</td></tr>
