<h3>The Latest: Depardieu, star of FIFA film, at draw</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Gerard Depardieu, the French actor who portrayed former FIFA president Jules Rimet in the much-panned movie "United Passions," was listed as a guest by FIFA at the qualifying draw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The film, premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, was released in North America on June 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While it cost about $30 million to make, it grossed about $900 at the box office in its first weekend of U.S. release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Because South America competes as a one 10-nation group, the draw determines merely the schedule.</td></tr>
