<h3>US, Ukraine start military training, defying Russian fury</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>YAVORIV, Ukraine (AP) - Troops from the United States and Ukraine kicked off joint training exercises Monday intended to help bolster Ukraine's defenses against incursions from Russian-backed separatists in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Speaking under driving rain at a military base in the western region of Lviv, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said the country's armed forces needed to be rebuilt from scratch to deter foreign threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The exercises, dubbed "Fearless Guardian-2015," sparked an enraged reaction from Russia, which described them as a potential cause of destabilization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Moscow continues to dismiss mounting evidence of its involvement in fomenting and supporting a separatist insurgency in Ukraine that has claimed more than 6,100 lives over the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 300 U.S. Army paratroopers involved in the training traveled to Ukraine last week and will be working alongside 900 national guardsmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The majority of the participants here from the Ukrainian side have endured difficult trials on the front," Poroshenko said at the inauguration ceremony for the exercises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Fighting in the east has ebbed substantially since the signing of a February cease-fire deal, but sporadic clashes still break out along the 450-kilometer front line separating government and rebel forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The truce deal includes provisions for all "armed formations" to be pulled out of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While Kiev interprets that language as being aimed at the Russian forces that Moscow denies are in Ukraine, the Kremlin has argued the United States is implicitly violating the cease-fire deal by stationing its military trainers in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Training for Ukrainian troops is part of a broader package of assistance being provided by the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>President Barack Obama's administration has said it will provide Ukraine's military with $75 million in nonlethal aid, but has refrained so far from offering lethal equipment, despite calls from Congress to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Last month, Ukraine began receipt of a planned consignment of 230 Humvees from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>National guard units, many of which began as volunteer groupings, have been an important part of Ukrainian forces' fighting against the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Two national guard units, working on weeklong rotations, are holding part of the village of Shyrokyne, currently the most fraught location in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ukrainian forces in Shyrokyne said Monday that unrest there had subsided since the arrival of observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Azov Battalion, which is leading the government's fight for the village, said heavy shelling had stopped, but reported a continuation of small arms fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"As of 11 a.m., despite the fact that OSCE observers are working in Shyrokyne, snipers are still targeting Azov positions," the battalion said in a statement.</td></tr>
