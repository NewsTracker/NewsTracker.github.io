<h3>Greek parliament head criticized over debt committee videos</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece's radical leftwing head of parliament has been criticized by opposition parties for posting videos on the parliament's website promoting her project to investigate the country's crippling debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 44-second videos end with the message "check it, erase it," referring to the country's 320 billion-euro ($350-billion) foreign debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Parliament speaker Zoi Constantopoulou's governing Syriza party won the Jan 25 elections promising to seek massive debt forgiveness, but has since agreed to honor its obligations to creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Costas Karagounis, spokesman of opposition party New Democracy, accused Constantopoulou Tuesday of using the parliament as "a propaganda mechanism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Constantopoulou says her "Debt Truth Committee," whose members include Zambian human rights law expert Cephas Lumina, will investigate how much of the debt is "illegal" with a view to writing it off.</td></tr>
