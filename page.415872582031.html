<h3>Google Doodle celebrates 126th Anniversary of Eiffel Tower's first public opening</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GOOGLE is celebrating the 126th Anniversary of the Eiffel Towers first ever public opening with a Doodle on its homepage to mark the occasion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Doodle shows six workmen on iron girders - nonchalantly putting the final touches to the iron structure - despite being over 1,000ft in the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Secured to the structure by safety lines which spell out the word Google, the workmen don't seem unnerved at the enormous task ahead of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One of the men can be seen wearing a traditional French beret, while two others have chosen to opt for a handlebar moustache and full bushy beard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Eiffel Tower, located on the Champ de Mars, Paris, was created by French civil engineer and architect Alexandre Gustave Eiffel in 1887 - serving as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair - to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French revolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Boasting three floors, the iron lattice tower is the tallest structure in Paris - attracting around seven million visitors to the iconic landmark each year.</td></tr>
