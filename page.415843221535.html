<h3>Coney Island Cyclone Roller Coaster Gets Stuck On Opening Day</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Cyclone, the famed wooden roller coaster at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, got stuck on its first operating day of the season on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The coaster at Luna Park got stuck near the top of its first big hill, and about a dozen riders were escorted off by foot and walked down along the tracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Eric Adams, the borough president came down and christened the ride, the dignitaries took their ride, everything went fine and then us general public went for a nice ride, and we had a little belt slippage, and they shut it down," Eric Napp, who is known as "Mr. Cyclone" and has been on the coaster more than 1,000 times, told ABC 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The locks were in place, so the ride didn't slide back down, and then staff came up and safely escorted us off the ride."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But not everyone took the evacuation in stride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was terrifying, because I was up there and everything was spinning," Gabriella Centeno told NBC New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I didn't know what to do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"That thing was the scariest thing I ever did," David Zubin told amNewYork.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The bricks, walking down, looked like it was going to break when you stepped on it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Luna Park, which operates the ride, posted on Facebook that no one was injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This was an isolated issue and it is quickly being resolved," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Those on the ride were safely evacuated according to our safety training procedures and will be able to ride again for free."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The ride is expected to reopen on Saturday, the next day the park is open, amNewYork reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Brooklyn Cyclone evacuation!!!</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That's another reason I'm not a big fan of roller coasters!!</td></tr>
