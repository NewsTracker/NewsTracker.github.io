<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) " Google is making its privacy controls easier to find and understand in an attempt to make the more than 1 billion users of its digital services feel more comfortable about the personal information that they give the Internet's most powerful company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The simpler approach debuting Monday features a redesigned "My Account" hub where all of Google's key privacy controls can be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Accountholders can also undergo a check-up that will break down which of the company's various services are gathering information about them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new system represents Google's tacit admission that its previous setup confused and frustrated people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Until now, the privacy controls were spread across far-flung sections of Google's website with few explanations of the pros and cons of adjusting each setting.</td></tr>
