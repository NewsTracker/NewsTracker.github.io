<h3>Global watchdog nudges up world economic growth forecast</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, a grouping of the world's richest countries that acts like a think tank, said Wednesday that easy and cheap monetary policy in many parts of the world, including Europe, has helped underpin growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, it warned that a total reliance on that tool could strain the international financial system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Paris-based organization now expects 4 percent growth this year, up 0.1 percentage points from its last such forecast in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And the prediction for 2016 was raised 0.2 percentage points, to 4.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The interim economic assessment concentrates on the world's biggest economies including Brazil, India and China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Despite the upgrades, the OECD warned that unusually low inflation and interest rates could increase the risk of global financial instability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And it noted still-high unemployment levels in many countries despite the improving growth picture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After years of crisis and stagnation in Europe, the OECD said plunging oil prices and the recently enacted monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank are a "much-needed opportunity" to get growth going again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It predicted 1.4 percent growth for the combined growth of the 19 countries that use the euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Insisting that monetary policy alone isn't enough to ensure a return to strong growth, it urged European leaders to stabilize budget rules and other regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The OECD said India should grow faster than China this year, at 7.7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>For Japan, it raised forecasts slightly to 1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It forecast 3.1 percent GDP growth for the United States this year, 7 percent for China and 2.6 percent for Britain, all largely unchanged from its last projections.</td></tr>

<h3>Investors cheer Nintendo move to smartphones</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The stock ended 21% higher at 17,080 yen ($141) in Tokyo, a day after Nintendo said it would develop mobile gaming apps with online gaming firm DeNA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the stock's biggest daily gain since Nintendo became public in 1983, adding some $4 billion to the company's market capitalisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nintendo is now worth $24 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Investors have long called on Nintendo, makers of the Wii U and the portable 3DS, to shift its focus to mobile devices after losing customers to both smartphone gaming app makers and console rivals like PlayStation maker Sony and Xbox maker Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company had so far resisted these calls, pinning hopes on hit games such as "Mario Kart 8".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But in January, it halved its operating earnings target for the current fiscal year to 20 billion yen ($169m), citing weak 3DS sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The move into smartphone apps could further dent console sales, some analysts said, despite assurances by President Satoru Iwata that Nintendo was committed to making gaming machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nintendo, however, may be shifting away from hardware, with Iwata saying it was developing a new gaming platform, the NX, as well as an online membership service to be launched this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Before the tie-up with DeNA, Nintendo's shares had fallen over 30% in the past four years, lagging a more than doubling in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>DeNA, which mainly develops games played on browsers, had also lost market share in the past two years as users moved to mobile apps.</td></tr>
