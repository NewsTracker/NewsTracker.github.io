<tr><td>2</td><td>The dollar index was down marginally at $97.88, its highest level since April on firming expectation of a U.S. interest rate hike later in the year.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>"The indexes will continue to stay range bound but at the higher end during the course of the earnings season because it has already factored in a rate hike this year," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.</td></tr>
