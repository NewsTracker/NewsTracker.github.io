<h3>Jeremy Clarkson says foreign cabbies' cars 'smell of vomit' in magazine article?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Top Gear host - whose future at the BBC is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer - made the controversial comments in the March edition of Top Gear magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He wrote: 'In London, there are two types of [cab] driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jeremy Clarkson behind the wheel of his car leaving his house in London yesterday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'You have a chap who has just arrived from a country you've never heard of, whose car smells faintly of lavender oil and sick, who doesn't know where he's going and can't get there anyway because he never puts more than 2 worth of fuel in the tank of his car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He also turned on drivers in the North, saying northern roads are overrun with immigrants 'who have never experienced tarmac before'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although it was unclear last night when Clarkson, 54, wrote the article, it was almost certainly before the dust-up in North Yorkshire, and sources close to the presenter believe his enemies immediately latched on to the magazine remarks to pile more pressure on the beleaguered star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clarkson's magazine comments were an embarrassing distraction for the presenter on the day he faced an interrogation over his dust-up with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon by BBC chiefs, who are said to be 'desperate' to get rid of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ken MacQuarrie, head of BBC Scotland, is leading an inquiry into the fracas and is expected to deliver a verdict within days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The inflammatory comments follow a string of rows over racism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Last year, Clarkson apologised after he was filmed allegedly using the N-word in the poem 'Eeny, meeny, miney, moe'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However, Clarkson has the backing of David Cameron, as well as Top Gear's fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Perry McCarthy said Top Gear would lose its 'fire' without Clarkson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>We are no longer accepting comments on this article.</td></tr>
