<h3>Polish lawmakers engage in military training due to 'troubled times' in neighboring Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WARSAW, Poland - Polish lawmakers have answered a call for military training, a mainly symbolic act as Poles grow nervous about the conflict next door in Ukraine and Russia's involvement in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Several lawmakers donned fatigues Tuesday and traveled to a training range not far from Warsaw to practice shooting, drilling and first aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They were answering a call from Parliament Speaker Radek Sikorski, who said the training should be a sign to young Poles that "times have come that may require a readiness to defend the country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The parliament press office would not say how many lawmakers took part or give other details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But private broadcaster Radio Zet posted pictures on Twitter of several lawmakers in camouflage outside the parliament building Tuesday as they prepared to travel for the one-day training.</td></tr>
