<h3>CIA men face drone strike charge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Pakistani judge has ordered criminal charges be filed against a former top CIA lawyer who oversaw its drone programme and a former station chief in Islamabad over a 2009 strike that killed two people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Former general counsel John A Rizzo and ex-station chief Jonathan Bank must face charges including murder, conspiracy, waging war against Pakistan and terrorism, Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui of the Islamabad High Court ruled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The two men could not be immediately reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The CIA declined to immediately comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Bank fled Pakistan in 2010 after his cover was blown when a Pakistani man named Kareem Khan initially threatened to sue the CIA and others for 500 million dollars over the deaths of his 18-year-old son, Zaenullah Khan, and his brother, Asif Iqbal, in a purported December 31, 2009, strike on the North Waziristan tribal region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Media reported at the time that three people were killed in a missile attack that day in Mir Ali in North Waziristan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pakistani intelligence officials said then that the men were militants, but offered no proof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As the outrage over the lawsuit grew, protesters in Islamabad began carrying placards bearing Mr Bank's name as listed in the lawsuit, urging him to leave the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The CIA didn't move Mr Bank, who had previously served in Baghdad, until he began receiving death threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The station chief's outing spurred questions at the time of whether Pakistan's spy service might have leaked the information, something the Pakistanis denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The disclosure didn't prevent Mr Bank from landing another sensitive job: He became chief of the Iran operations division at CIA headquarters at Langley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He later was removed from that post after CIA officials concluded he created a hostile work environment in the division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He has since been detailed to the Pentagon's intelligence arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Rizzo was the CIA's acting general counsel overseeing its drone programme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He later left the agency and wrote a book about his experiences at the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The CIA's drone strike program killed Pakistani Taliban fighters and other militants hiding in its tribal regions, but caused major anger across Pakistan over civilian casualties from the strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Any legal action stands no chance of success unless US officials cooperate with the court, something highly unlikely given the secretive nature of the missile strike programme.</td></tr>
