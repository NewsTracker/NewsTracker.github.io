<h3>Egypt allows Gazans to return home through border crossing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) - Egypt has opened its border with the Gaza Strip to allow stranded Palestinians to return home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tuesday's opening was the first time the Rafah border crossing has operated since March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The director of the Hamas-controlled side of the crossing, Maher Abu Sabha, says the border is scheduled to close again Wednesday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The crossing has only been open five days this year to allow movement of Palestinians in both directions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The one-direction opening reflects the deepening hostility between Gaza's Hamas rulers and Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cairo considers Hamas an extension of the pan-Arab Muslim Brotherhood movement, which it considers a terrorist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Abu Sabha called on Egypt to fully open the crossing, saying 15,000 people are waiting to depart from Gaza, including 3,000 medical patients.</td></tr>
