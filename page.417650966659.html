<h3>Mexico' government says teacher testing will go ahead as planned</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY - The Mexican government says teacher testing will go on as planned, despite the objections of radical teachers' unions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The teachers had vowed to disrupt the June 7 midterm elections unless constitutionally mandated teacher evaluations were dropped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Many teachers in Mexico's under-performing schools have essentially inherited their posts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On May 29, the government appeared to bow to their demands by announcing that the tests would be "indefinitely suspended."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That was seen as a trade-off to keep elections peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Only about 600 polling places suffered disruptions of a total of 148, 836.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Tuesday, the Education Department said testing will be held between September and November for about 360,000 public school teachers and almost 193,000 people applying for teaching positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Teachers who refuse to take the tests will lose important bonuses.</td></tr>
