<tr><td>2</td><td>Los Angeles: Police and a city official in Ferguson, Missouri, sent racially charged emails comparing minority welfare recipients to dogs and made insensitive comments about Muslims, copies of the emails released by the city show.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>A small group of protestors gather at the memorial for Michael Brown at Canfield Apartments in Ferguson, Missouri in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The report came seven months after the shooting death in Ferguson of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man, by white Officer Darren Wilson sparked violent protests and demands for a federal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We have found substantial evidence of racial bias among police and court staff in Ferguson," the report said, citing in particular the emails that equated blacks with criminals and joked about an abortion by a black woman being a means of crime control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Most of the emails, dated from 2008 to 2011, appear to be sent from Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty to police Captain Rick Henke and Sergeant William Mudd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Henke and Mr Mudd have since resigned; Ms Twitty was fired because of the emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A protester demonstrates against police brutality after the Ferguson shooting of Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>An email from Ms Twitty to the officers jokes about "insensitive one liners", one of which made crass comments about Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Mudd sent Twitty an email in 2011 that took a stab at welfare recipients, calling them "lazy" and implying they can't speak English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Last week I went to sign my dogs up for welfare. At first the lady said, 'Dogs are not eligible to draw welfare,'" the email reads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"So I explained to her that my dogs are mixed in colour, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English and have no frigging clue who their Daddies are. They expect me to feed them, provide them with housing and medical care. So she looked in her police book to see what it takes to qualify. My dogs get their first checks Friday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A third email showed a picture of black women during a tribal gathering and called it "Michelle Obama's high school reunion".</td></tr>
