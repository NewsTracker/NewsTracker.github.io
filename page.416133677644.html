<h3>Islamic State attacks Iraqi provincial capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The jihadists deployed vehicle and suicide bombs to tear through Iraqi government lines north of the city of Ramadi overnight before attacking on foot, said security officials and a hospital source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The head of Anbar's provincial council, Sabah Karhout, called on Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to send urgent military reinforcements and supplies to fighters, saying they were running low on ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Abadi visited Anbar on Tuesday and declared the start of the operation to liberate the Sunni Muslim heartland, seeking to build on a victory over the extremist Islamic State last week in the city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But a police source in Ramadi said early on Friday the insurgents had taken half of the Albu Faraj area, and provincial council member Athal al-Fahdawi later said it had been overrun completely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hundreds of families were fleeing Albu Faraj, just north of Ramadi and a car bomb blew up the bridge linking the two places across the Euphrates river, a police source said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An army officer and the police source blamed members of the Albu Faraj tribe who live in that area for letting the militants infiltrate their area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The insurgents also took over the adjacent Albu Aitha area, according to Fahdawi and local tribal leader Sheikh Ghassan al-Ithawi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Large parts of Anbar had slipped from the government's grasp even before Islamic State overran the northern city of Mosul last June and surged through Sunni areas of Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Islamic State controls large swathes of both Syria and Iraq, last year declaring a caliphate across the territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Security forces and Shi'ite Muslim paramilitaries have since regained some ground in Iraq, although core Sunni territories remain under Islamic State control including Anbar and the northern province of Nineveh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In Anbar, which shares a long border with Syria, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, pockets of territory have remained under government control and Ramadi itself has been contested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Shi'ite militia have played a leading role in reversing the insurgents' advances elsewhere, but officials from predominantly Sunni Anbar have expressed reservations about a role for the paramilitary forces on the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In the capital Baghdad, 13 people were killed in three separate explosions, medical and security sources said.</td></tr>
