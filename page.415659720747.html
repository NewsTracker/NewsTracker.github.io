<h3>Barcelona 1-0 Real Madrid LA LIGA LIVE: Jeremy Mathieu nets opener in El Clasico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thankfully the referee books him on this occasion after his dive to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ronaldo had just danced through three Barcelona players, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>35mins: The challenges are flying in now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Neymar on Modric, Rakitic on Pepe - we have a real game on our hands here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rik Sharma: Neymar seems to have been injected with the same ailment which Cesc Fabregas suffers from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Brazilian was incredible in the first half of the season, but in the past few months things haven't been going his way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>GOAL!!</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lionel who?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The visitors are back in it!</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ronaldo links up with Benzema, whose exquisite back heel finds the Portuguese forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cristiano makes no mistake, toe-poking the ball beyond the despairing Barcelona goalkeeper Bravo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Things could have been so different, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>30 seconds before, Neymar missed a superb opportunity, somehow volleying into Iker Casillas' arms when unmarked at the back post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>28mins: Well, Luis Suarez wasn't going to stay out of the action for long, was he?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The striker catches Pepe from behind and the referee quickly reaches for the yellow card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Those two could be in for quite a battle tonight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>22mins: Barca have their tailes up now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Messi has another free-kick, this time more central, deflected out for a corner - while the argy-bargy's have well and truly begun with Ivan Rakitic getting involved in the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We have our first goal in El Clasico!</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Real Madrid were looking good but are caught out by a set-piece, as Messi's free-kick finds the unmarked Jeremy Mathieu in the box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The French defender scores his first league goal for the club and Iker Casillas has no chance - but that's poor defending from the visitors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Barca still haven't found their rhythm, but find themselves in front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Too close for comfort?</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Barcelona 0-0 Real Madrid - Off the bar!</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>13mins: Great opportunity for Real Madrid to take the lead, and it falls to that man Cristiano Ronaldo... just who they would have wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Karim Benzema breaks the offside trap and finds Ronaldo at the back post, but his volley cannons off the woodwork.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Good spell for Madrid - Isco goes close shortly after before Sergio Ramos heads over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>10mins: Now the Barca fans aren't happy with Gareth Bale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Welsh winger clips the heels of Jordi Alba, he says inadvertently, but is given a word by the referee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Andres Iniesta, now up and moving freely, is dictating the game so far, though Karim Benzema has had a shot for the visitors, screwing his effort wide from the edge of the box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>6mins: Whistles ringing out every time Cristiano Ronaldo touches the ball, as you might expect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Ivan Rakitic is down there looking to double up on the forward with Dani Alves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Messi with his first nutmeg!</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That didn't take long... Toni Kroos is left looking a little foolish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A fine one-two sets Andres Iniesta through down the left, his cutback finds Ivan Rakitic but his effort is deflected over the bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Rik Sharma: Barcelona supporters hold up blue, red and yellow pieces of card to create a huge mosaic, praising the club's 12th man - the fans themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Players, supporters" it reads, above a Barcelona shirt with No 12 on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>While the club often arrange displays like this for big games, this is a clear dig at Real Madrid, whose fans have turned on the team in recent times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The first ever televised Clasico was aired in 1959 to around a million people on 60,000 televisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Real Madrid beat Barcelona 1-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>About 400m watching tonight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Including some 30,000 ft up as Turkish Airlines agreed a deal to screen game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The Camp Nou is packed, and the players are heading into the tunnel now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>What are your predictions?</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>We've got to expect goals, surely!</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The momentum is with Barcelona at the moment, with 18 wins in 19 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Madrid are faltering, jeered by their own fans lately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>And as any of the 22 players who will shortly be with us would say, precisely none of that matters in a Clasico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Madrid's players have gone back inside, to the same noise they came out to, while Barcelona's are warming up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The stadium is nearly full, the game is almost upon us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Watch out for a mosaic that will be created by the fans and cover the whole of the Nou Camp just before kick-off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>'I played in a lot of big games the only thing I can compare it with is Champions League final or World Cup final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>'Lionel Messi?</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>He is a joke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>It's not even funny any more, I don't know how to take it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>On Messi and Ronaldo: 'They help each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>That rivalry - thank god they're there because we see the best out of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Barca [will win] - their momentum is way better, Madrid are struggling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>As team-sheets go, you'd be hard pressed to find one with more star names on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Messi, Suarez, Neymar, Bale, Ronaldo, Benzema... and those are just the forwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Real Madrid's stars have come out to warm up, greeted with a barage of whistles and abuse, as you'd expect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>For Barcelona, it's just Claudio Bravo and Marc-Andre ter Stegen out there at the moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Barcelona and Real Madrid's Sunday night showdown dominates the front pages of Spain's newspapers as El Clasico nears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Marca ask the question 'MSN or BBC' as Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar go head to head with Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The feeling in Spain's newspapers is that this match could decide who wins the La Liga title, with Carlo Ancelotti's Real just one point behind Luis Enrique's Barca.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>OLLIE HOLT: Please stop turning Lionel Messi into a god!</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>The need to anoint Lionel Messi the greatest player there has ever been every time he has a good game is becoming rather tedious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Yes, Messi is a genius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Every time I see him play live, it is a privilege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>I try to make sure the memories are burned into my consciousness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>He is the kind of player who lifts the spirit with everything he does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>He is a quite prodigious goalscorer, a wizard of a dribbler and a provider for others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>And yes, he was mesmerising against Manchester City at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>The way he nutmegged James Milner, the way he turned Bacary Sagna before Joe Hart saved from him at point-blank range, the caressed curling ball to Ivan Rakitic for the Barcelona winner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>It was all magical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>As a football fan, I worship Messi, too, but I don't think he's the best there's ever been.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>It's too early for that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Party time!</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>And what quality we will have on the field tonight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Luka Modric is back for Real Madrid and partners World Cup winner Toni Kroos, with Oscar and the 'BBC' ahead of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Sergio Busquets is only fit enough to make the bench for the hosts, with Javier Mascherano anchoring that midfield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Claudio Bravo returns to the starting line up in what is the only change from the Champions League win against Manchester City in midweek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>The atmosphere is building at the Nou Camp, as you might expect!</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Modric, Kroos, Isco, Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Bravo, Alves, Pique, Mathieu, Alba, Rakitic, Mascherano, Iniesta, Messi, Suarez, Neymar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Subs: Ter Stegen, Busquets, Xavi, Pedro, Rafinha, Bartra, Adriano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Two of the biggest sides in club football, separated by a point in La Liga, face off at the Nou Camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Forget Liverpool vs Manchester United - all eyes are on Barcelona and Real Madrid this evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>The players have arrived and we will have team news very shortly, ahead of what should be a fast and furious fixture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>So, who will come out on top?</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>Join Sportsmail for coverage of El Clasico as Barcelona host archrivals Real Madrid at the Nou Camp on Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Luis Enrique's side are in fine form and lead Real by a point at the top of La Liga, with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez impressing in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>But despite the Galacticos' questionable run, they will be a huge threat with Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo, set to form 'BBC'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Kick-off is at 8pm, so join us for all the updates with PETE JENSON and RIK SHARMA.</td></tr>
