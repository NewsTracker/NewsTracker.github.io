<h3>Boko Haram pledges allegiance to Islamic State: monitoring group</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nigeria's militant Islamist group Boko Haram appears to have pledged allegiance to militant group Islamic State (IS), which rules a self-declared caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jihadist monitoring group SITE said the declaration was made in an unverified audio message from Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau, posted on Boko Haram's Twitter account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We announce our allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims, Ibrahim ibn Awad ibn Ibrahim al-Husseini al-Qurashi ... and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity, in hardship and ease," read an English language translation of the audio broadcast in Arabic that purported to be from the Nigerian militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We call upon Muslims everywhere to pledge allegiance to the Caliph."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Qurashi is better known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the IS group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri: "[The audio] is confirming what we always thought. It's sad, it's bad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's why we were appealing to the international community ... hopefully the world will wake up to the disaster unfolding here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The symbolic move highlights increased coordination between jihadi movements across north Africa and the Middle East and prompted an appeal from Nigeria's government for greater international help in tackling the Boko Haram insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Boko Haram has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds during its six-year campaign to carve out an Islamist state in northern Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In recent months it has increased cross-border raids into Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It would be the latest in a series of groups to swear allegiance to IS, with the group having already accepted pledges of allegiance from other jihadist groups in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan and north Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On Saturday, four bomb blasts killed at least 50 people in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri in the worst attacks there since Boko Haram militants tried to seize the town in two major assaults earlier this year.</td></tr>
