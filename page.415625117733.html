<h3>A coffin fit for a King: Farewell to Richard III</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bones was matched to Michael Ibsen, a Canadian cabinetmaker and direct descendant of Richard III's sister, Anne of York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Scientists at the University of Leicester say their examination of the skeleton shows Richard met a violent death: They found evidence of 11 wounds -- nine to the head and two to the body -- that they believe were inflicted at or around the time of death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Here, the base of the skull shows one of the potentially fatal injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This shows clearly how a section of the skull had been sliced off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The lower jaw shows a cut mark caused by a knife or dagger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The archaeologists say the wounds to Richard's head could have been what killed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A wound to the cheek, possibly caused by a square-bladed dagger, can be seen here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This hole in the top of the skull represents a penetrating injury to the top of the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Two flaps of bone, related to the penetrating injury to the top of the head, can clearly be seen on the interior of the skull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The image shows a blade wound to the pelvis, which has penetrated all the way through the bone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Here, a cut mark on the right rib can be seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As the skeleton was being excavated, a notable curve in the spine could be seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>(The width of the curve is correct, but the gaps between vertebrae have been increased to prevent damage from them touching one another.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The body was found in a roughly hewn grave that experts say was too small for the body, forcing it to be squeezed into an unusual position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The positioning also shows that his hands may have been tied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Because this isn't any ordinary commission: the casket will be the final resting place of one of Ibsen's distant relatives, Richard III, who died more than 500 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It is a unique privilege," says Canadian-born Ibsen, whose DNA was used to establish the identity of the English King, found buried beneath a car parking lot in the city of Leicester in August 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There's a wonderful serendipity in a sense that someone involved in the identification of the remains should happen to be furniture maker who can do this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"When you're working away you just focus on joining two bits of wood, but at the end of the day when you stand back and think 'I'm building Richard III's coffin,' it's incredible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ibsen says he's been on an "extraordinary journey" in the two-and-a-half years since he gave a DNA swab to genetics specialist Turi King on the off chance that experts searching for the burial place of his seventeen-times great-uncle might strike it lucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Canadian-born furniture-maker Michael Ibsen is a direct descendant of Richard III's sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Back then even the man in charge of the dig, archaeologist Richard Buckley, didn't expect to find anything -- he told colleagues he'd "eat his hat" if they turned up the long-lost King's remains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"When we were planning the project, I never made any secret of the fact I thought it very unlikely we'd be successful," Buckley told CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The chances of hitting the right spot were very slim."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Call it a fluke, or call it fate, but as it turned out they hit the right spot almost immediately: Richard III's skeleton was found on the very first day of the dig, in the first trench dug by the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>At the time, all the experts knew was that they'd found a set of leg bones, chopped off at the feet by building work at some point in the intervening centuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It wasn't until days later, as archaeologist Jo Appleby carefully exhumed the rest of the skeleton that she spotted the distinct curve of its spine, and the devastating damage medieval weapons had left on its skull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>For Philippa Langley, founder of the "Looking for Richard" project, who stood watching with bated breath as the bones were uncovered, the discovery was a vindication of the years she had spent trying to get people to search for the King's remains -- and to look again at his reputation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Say the name Richard III to many people, and the image which will spring to mind is that of Shakespeare's villain, hunchbacked and murderous, who met a grisly end on the battlefield at Bosworth after killing his nephews, the Princes in the Tower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Years of research had convinced Langley of two things: firstly, that his remains lay underneath a car park, in what had once been the Grey Friars' monastery, and secondly, that he was much-maligned, the victim of bitter Tudor propaganda after his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Two-and-a-half years on, Langley believes the discovery -- which proved her first theory to be correct -- and the scientific research carried out since, have forced a rethink of Richard III's story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"As a writer my view of Richard has always been that he was a very complex, very conflicted, very flawed individual -- that's the human condition: We are all flawed, complex, conflicted -- but there was something heroic about him, he was courageous on and off the battlefield," she explains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>She says DNA evidence that the King was blue eyed and fair haired -- in contrast to portraits and written descriptions which painted him "as a hunchback, with a withered arm and a crippled gait, with 'evil' dark eyes and hair" -- had "blow[n] the mythology out of the window."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"It makes people question, drop their preconceptions, forget their assumptions, and go back to the beginning," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>This weekend, Richard III's skeleton will leave the laboratory at the University of Leicester, where it has been kept since it was found, and be taken back to Bosworth, scene of his death in 1485, for a commemoration ceremony, before being returned to Leicester ahead of its reburial next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>And while his body last made that trip slung unceremoniously over the back of a horse, this time the journey will be done in style: carried in the coffin made by his great-nephew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Inside, the smaller bones from his hands and feet will be tucked into linen bags -- each one decorated with a rose, representing the House of York, Richard III's family -- sewn by children from Leicester's King Richard III Infant School.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"I feel very proud because I've never made a bag for a king before," said Xi Chen, who helped make the pouches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"It's like I'm a servant doing something for a King," added his classmate Irfan Sheikh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Lead conservation specialist Jon Castleman -- who previously helped to restore the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem -- will be the last person to set eyes on the skeleton, as he welds the ossuary inside the casket shut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Well-wishers are expected to line the route as the cortege winds through the Leicestershire countryside, stopping at several churches along the way for prayers and religious services before making its way back to Leicester Cathedral, near the site of the archaeological dig, where a new tomb has been built for the King.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Historian John Ashdown-Hill, who discovered the genealogical link between Richard III and Michael Ibsen, says it is important that the King's Catholic beliefs are recognized in the ceremonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Ashdown-Hill, who shares Richard III's faith, has had a rosary, featuring the white Yorkist rose and a crucifix like one thought to have been owned by Richard III's mother, made to be placed inside the coffin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>For Langley, the procession and celebrations are key to repairing past damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"The ethos and aim of the project was to give Richard what he didn't get in 1485," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"The reason we wanted to do that was to recognize what went on in the past but not repeat it, to make peace with history."</td></tr>

<h3>Tunisia arrests suspected militants after museum attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisian authorities have arrested more than 20 suspected militants in a nationwide security crackdown since gunmen killed 23 people, mostly foreign tourists, in Wednesday's attack in the capital, the government said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hundreds of people gathered for a mass in the cathedral in Tunis on Saturday, lighting candles to remember the victims, who included three Tunisians, in a ceremony attended by government ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Outside, there was a heavy police presence along the central Habib Bourguiba boulevard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Tunis was calm, with a music festival going ahead in the city center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wednesday's assault, the deadliest involving foreigners in Tunisia since a 2002 suicide bombing on the island of Djerba, came at a fragile moment for a country just emerging to full democracy after a popular uprising four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The government said the two gunmen had trained in jihadi camps in Libya before the attack at the Bardo museum inside the heavily secured Tunisian parliament compound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Japanese, French, Polish, Italian and Colombian visitors were among the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Authorities have arrested more than 20 suspected militants, including 10 believed to be directly involved in the Bardo attack, Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There is a large-scale campaign against the extremists," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The ministry released a photograph of another suspect and asked Tunisians to help with information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The government plans to deploy the army to major cities to improve security following the shootings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the attack, but social media accounts tied to an al Qaeda-affiliated group in Tunisia have also published purported details of the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Whoever was responsible, the Bardo attack illustrates how Islamist militants are turning their attention to North Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A particular focus is neighboring Libya, where two rival governments are battling for control, allowing Islamic State to gain a foothold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The United States is increasingly worried about the growing presence of Islamic State militants in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In an interview with Paris Match magazine, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said there were as many as 10,000 young Tunisian jihadists in all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Four thousand Tunisians have joined jihad, in Syria, Libya and elsewhere, and some 500 have already come back here, where they pose a threat. That is not to mention the five or six thousand others we have succeeded in preventing from leaving."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>U.S. officials said that because of its strategic position, Libya has become a springboard for would-be fighters from across North Africa wanting to link up with Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The militant group controls large swathes of Iraq and Syria, and claimed responsibility for suicide bombings at two mosques that killed at least 137 people in the capital of Yemen on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Four years after a popular revolt toppled autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has completed its transition to democracy with free elections, a new constitution and compromise politics between secular and Islamist parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But the attack threatens to hit the economy of a country that is heavily reliant on drawing foreign visitors to its beach resorts and desert treks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Authorities have tightened security at hotels and tourist spots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"This attack will have an impact, no doubt. But so far we have only had a small number of cancellations," Tourism Minister Salma Loumi told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"On the contrary, we are seeing support from Western countries and travel agencies."</td></tr>
