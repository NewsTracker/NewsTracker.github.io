<tr><td>10</td><td>Poachers killed 164 elephants in Kenya last year, compared with 302 in 2013 and 384 in 2012, while 53 rhinos were killed in 2014 compared with 59 and 30 in the previous two years, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Kenyan government partly attributes the reduction in poaching to tougher laws enacted last year, said Paul Muya, deputy spokesman for the service.</td></tr>
