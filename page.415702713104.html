<h3>Atletico coach Simeone extends contract to 2020</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The deal, which runs until the end of the 2019-20 campaign, was widely expected although that did not prevent plenty of speculation a wealthy rival could try to lure Simeone away from the club he twice represented as a player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I have chosen to be here because I am convinced the club will continue to grow," Simeone told a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Because it is strong, there is enthusiasm and there are people here whose desire to participate is stronger each day," added the 44-year-old Argentine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A former Argentina captain said to play "with a knife between his teeth", the combative Simeone transformed Atletico after taking over at the end of 2011, leading them to their first domestic league title in 18 years last term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Atletico won the Europa League at the end of his debut season and reached the final of the Champions League in 2013-14 where they lost 4-1 to Real Madrid after extra time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They thrashed Chelsea 4-1 to claim the 2012 European Super Cup, won the King's Cup a year later by beating Real in the final and defeated their neighbours over two legs to secure the Spanish Super Cup in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Real will again be their opponents in the quarter-finals of the latest edition of the Champions League, with the first leg at Atletico's Calderon stadium on April 14 and the return at the Bernabeu eight days later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He triumphed as a player and became a club legend and we knew we weren't making a mistake when we proposed to bring him back as coach," Atletico president Enrique Cerezo told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"He has helped us underpin the club's growth with his tremendous success on the pitch and he has consolidated our place among the European soccer elite," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Atletico are unlikely to defend their La Liga title this season as they are nine points behind leaders Barcelona in fourth with 10 games left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As well as the Champions League last eight, Simeone's priority for the remainder of the campaign will be to secure a lucrative berth in Europe's elite club competition again for next season.</td></tr>
