<h3>Ferguson hires another interim police chief</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Associated Press, FERGUSON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Andre Anderson speaks during a news conference announcing him as the interim police chief of the Ferguson Police Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Ferguson police force has changed leadership again, with a third chief in four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The city on Wednesday introduced Andre Anderson, 50, as interim chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Anderson previously was police commander in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, Arizona - the same city from which Ferguson recently hired its interim city manager, Ed Beasley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Anderson will take a six-month leave of absence from Glendale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His duties in Ferguson begin Thursday, and he made it clear he's interested in becoming the city's permanent chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I'm hoping that I'm a candidate for the full-time position," Anderson said, but insisted his focus now is on building trust between police and the people of Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Several top officials resigned in Ferguson after a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report in March, citing racial bias and profiling in policing as well as a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targeted blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Justice Department investigation was initiated after the fatal shooting on Aug. 9 of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, by a white Ferguson officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Following the report, Ferguson's municipal judge, city manager and Police Chief Tom Jackson resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Assistant chief Al Eickhoff was promoted to interim chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With Anderson's arrival, Eickhoff will return to his role as assistant chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Anderson, like Beasley, is black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Eickhoff and Jackson, who was chief for five years, are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Anderson has more than 24 years of experience as a police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That includes overseeing Glendale's 80 detectives in the criminal investigation division and roughly 125 patrol officers, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I believe I am the right person for this particular job," Anderson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Among his priorities, Anderson said he wants to help attract and hire qualified applicants for police jobs, filling positions "that reflect the demographics of the community."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Ferguson is about two-thirds black but the vast majority of its police officers are white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"There's a lot of work to be done. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work, and I appreciate this opportunity," Anderson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Beasley said Anderson is "exceptionally known nationally for his ability to lead and his innovation," referring to Anderson's expertise in community policing and outreach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Eickhoff had joined the Ferguson police force just days before Brown was killed during a confrontation with officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The shooting touched off often-violent protests in Ferguson and a national "Black Lives Matter" movement seeking changes in how police deal with minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury last November declined to indict Wilson, who later resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Justice Department also declined to prosecute Wilson, announcing that decision at the same time it released the March report critical of police and court practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mayor James Knowles III said Ferguson in recent months has adopted reforms, including hiring a new interim judge and revamping the municipal court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He said Ferguson police were among the first in the St. Louis region to equip officers with body cameras in the wake of Brown's death.</td></tr>
