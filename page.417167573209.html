<h3>Former Boko Haram captives still held _ by Nigerian military</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>YOLA, Nigeria (AP) - The accusations against a woman who was rescued from Boko Haram abductors came from fellow former captives during a group counseling session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Why had she received preferential treatment and better food while they were held?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wasn't she married to a fighter from the Islamic extremist group?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As scores of young Nigerian women and children are rescued from the clutches of Boko Haram, they face suspicions that they may still be in contact with their former captors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>These fears apparently have led to an entire group of 275 women and girls rescued from the extremists last month being forced to remain in custody - held this time by the Nigerian military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Gen. Chris Olukolade, claimed Thursday that they were moved to get "proper medical attention and psycho-social therapy" under a program organized by the national security adviser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Olukolade was quoted by PR Nigeria, an agency that puts out Nigerian government news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of the trauma counselors who had been working with the women said the group had nearly completed their therapy and camp officials had been preparing to reunite some with their families, before the military took them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After creating havoc in northeastern Nigeria for years, Boko Haram militants have suffered a series of defeats this year from an offensive by better-equipped Nigerian troops bolstered by forces from neighboring Chad, Niger and Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As the militants retreat, the many captives they seized are being rescued, but that doesn't mean their ordeal is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Many remain traumatized by their harsh captivity - including rape, sexual slavery and beatings - as well as suspicions that some cooperated with their captors and may still support them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In counseling sessions at the Malkohi Camp outside the northeastern city of Yola, witnesses described some women accusing another one of having ties to their former Boko Haram captors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Relations between soldiers guarding the camp and some of the rescued women had been tense after a fracas witnessed May 17 by a reporter in which a soldier falsely claimed that one of the women tried to grab his gun and told him she was a Boko Haram member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Tuesday, soldiers took the group of more than 200 children - almost all younger than 5 - and 67 girls and women from the camp, the National Emergency Management Agency has confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Agency spokesman Sani Datti said he had no other information because it was an "entirely military affair."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The group was put on a military plane and flown to an unknown destination, possibly the capital of Abuja, a camp official and a military intelligence officer told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media about the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Their move from the camp only became known after an AP story about the heroism of one teenager, Binta Ibrahim, prompted two readers to send $500 to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>An AP reporter who went to the camp to find out how to get the money to her discovered the group was no longer there.</td></tr>
