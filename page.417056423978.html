<h3>Islamic State recruits as Tunisia grapples with freedoms</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TUNIS, May 17 (Reuters) - Tunisian militants have fought in foreign wars for decades, from Afghanistan to Somalia to Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But after the 2011 revolt against President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, hundreds of hard-liners were released from prisons, strengthening militant ranks with experienced old hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Critics accused the Islamist-led government that followed Ali of allowing extremists too much freedom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Since then, a caretaker government and a coalition government elected at the end of 2014 have taken a tougher line, going to court to take back mosques, sweeping up hundreds of suspected militants, and curbing militant websites that recruit for Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Journalist Hedi Yahmed, whose book, "Beneath the Black flag: Tunisia's Salafists," features interviews with Tunisian militants fighting in Iraq, Somalia and Syria, said the jihadi phenomenon was driven in part by the end of 20 years of religious repression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This generation has to deal with this image of Tunisia that is liberal, secular, that gives freedoms to women. Now a young Tunisian in Iraq and Syria desperately wants to show there is another side to Tunisia, one even more attached to that form of extreme Islam," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nouredine Mbarki, a Tunisian specialist in extremist groups, said Islamic State recruiters wanted more middle-class youth, to take advantage of their education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"They are more flexible, and can help apply the group's communication strategy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That has Tunis worried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In an Islamic State video posted online in March, a masked Tunisian jihadist by the name of Abu Yahya al-Tounessi called on Tunisian brothers to join him in Libya to prepare for a bigger campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are coming to conquer back Tunisia," he said in the video, Kalashnikov strapped to his back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I swear you will not be at ease now with the Islamic State a few kilometers from you just across the border."</td></tr>
