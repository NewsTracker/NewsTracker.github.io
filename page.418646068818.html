<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (AP) " Germany's vice chancellor is criticizing the country's finance minister for suggesting that Greece could take a five-year "timeout" from the shared euro currency to address its financial problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sigmar Gabriel, who is also Germany's economy minister, said on ZDF television Sunday "it wasn't prudent to make this suggestion as a German suggestion," the dpa news agency reported.</td></tr>
