<h3>Bali nine executions: spiritual advisers ready for final hours</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Every day that he catches the ferry to Nusakambangan island he packs extra clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Any moment those on death row could learn they have just 72 hours to live and Hasan be asked to share their final days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Under previous governments the timing of the killings was kept a secret, so Hasan is always prepared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"My role is to prepare the convicts to be ready to face what they have to face," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"God gives the strength to these people not me. I am just the mediator."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hasan attended the executions of Muslims Namaona Denis from Malawi and Rani Adriani from Indonesia on January 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Denis was sentenced to death in 2001 after being convicted of smuggling 940 grams of heroin at the Soekarno-Hatta airport in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>According to reports, Denis did not understand his trial proceedings as he was not provided with adequate interpretation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hasan said counselling Denis was difficult because he was convinced until the end his lawyer would save him from the firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I had to find a balance between not disturbing his mental state but at the same time preparing him for death," Hasan says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The two are completely opposite."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Spiritual counsellors for the 10 drug felons now facing the firing squad - including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - have a similarly delicate task of balancing hope with reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Five of the condemned have ongoing legal proceedings and lawyers for Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte are still hopeful he will be spared because he has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hasan, who has worked in the seven prisons on Nusakambangan island for 25 years, says it is easier to provide counsel to someone with whom he already has a relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Because of that the person can go into the isolation room calmer," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>To offer succour through someone's last days and at the moment of death requires enormous mental preparation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I pray before the execution, on the execution day and when I have to see the convict for the last time. I say a lot of prayers at the mosque because I need strength to do my job," Hasan says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I pray the person I have to meet can also be strengthened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Edyward Kaban, the head of the prosecutor's office in Cilacap, agrees that it is best when a prisoner already knows the religious counsellor who will accompany them in their last days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It is difficult if he doesn't know the man," Mr Edyward says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He says religious counsellors from all faiths are registered to visit Nusakambangan prisons and know the inmates well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>However it could also be possible for prisoners to choose their own spiritual counsellor if they present their credentials to the Cilacap prosecutor's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Father Charles Burrows, a priest who lives in Cilacap, was furious when a mix-up last January meant he was not allowed on the island to administer the last rites to Brazilian drug trafficker Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Gularte's family has requested he be at his execution - although Father Burrows hopes it will not come to that - and at least two other prisoners are also Catholics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"If they don't let me go I will go to all the embassies - there will be very strong protests," Burrows says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Meanwhile, Hasan says there are four stages of repentance required to get to heaven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>One must completely forget one's previous life, show remorse, commit to not sinning again and pray to God.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I told Denis he had a very short time so he had to open his heart sincerely and aim his prayer to the highest place. I also prayed for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"The guard stood at the front of his cell and said: 'There is a visitor at your gate. Are you ready?' Denis nodded, rose from his chair, went to the gate and met the guard who took him to the execution site. I was optimistic he was ready."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Later, after the executions were over, Hasan was met by journalists at the ferry dock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I told them Rani and Denis ended their lives well."</td></tr>
