<h3>FIFA confirms Qatar 2022 World Cup final on December 18</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA has confirmed that the final of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be played on December 18, the country's national day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA spokesman Walter De Gregorio said on Thursday the announcement was a "major step" and said the executive committee of football's world governing body could confirm the start date on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1,568 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That's how long it's taken the custodians of world football to finally decide on a date for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is a major step because finally we know and we can move forward," De Gregorio said in a statement at FIFA headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In principle we will try to play in 28 days. The next stage will be to have talks ... in particular related to the international match calendar."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FIFA's executive committee prefers a 28-day tournament, four days fewer than usual and starting on November 21, but did not make a decision in the opening session of its two-day meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The November through to December option had been expected after being recommended by a FIFA-appointed task force which met last month in Doha, the Qatari capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The task force sought to take FIFA's lucrative event out of the Qatari summer heat in the June to July period when World Cups are traditionally played.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter then said he preferred a Sunday, December 18, final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Every World Cup final since 1966 has been played on a Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>By rejecting UEFA's preferred December 23 final, a Friday, the FIFA executive committee helped protect the English Premier League's traditional December 26 program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A 28-day World Cup would cut the time clubs must release players to national teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Both FIFA and Qatar have fought off questions of corruption ever since they were awarded the tournament back in 2010, with Qatar accusing its critics of a clear bias against the Gulf monarchy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The world of football does not revolve around European clubs and its time they realise that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A day after announcing 2022 football World Cup will take place in Nov-Dec, Fifa ruled out compensating affected clubs.</td></tr>
