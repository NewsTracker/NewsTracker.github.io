<h3>Egypt steps up security after foiling suicide bomb attack in Luxor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The scene of the foiled suicide attack outside the Temple of Karnak in Luxor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Egyptian police said they foiled an attempted suicide bomb attack Wednesday on one of the country's most popular tourist destinations in Luxor, killing two militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police said one attacker detonated a bomb and two other assailants died in a firefight close to the famed Karnak temple in Luxor, a town 700 kilometres south of Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Temple of Karnak in Luxor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A source at the interior ministry said no tourists were hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Luxor police said officers opened fire on three men after they had had refused to undergo security screening at a checkpoint outside the temple, shooting two of them dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The third attacker managed to detonate a bomb he was carrying, according to officers on the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Local health ministry official Nahed Mohamed told AFP there were "two militants killed and one wounded" in the foiled attack, adding that two civilians and two policemen were also wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The police kept visitors at the temple inside the site during the operation, a senior antiquities ministry official told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Security forces in Luxor foiled a terrorist operation ... Two terrorists killed and a third was wounded," the police said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jihadists have claimed regular bomb attacks in Egypt since the army's ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in July 2013 and a brutal crackdown on his supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tourists have been largely spared from attacks although a suicide bombing last year on a tour bus in the restive Sinai Peninsula, home of the local branch of the jihadist Islamic State group, killed three South Koreans and their Egyptian driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Karnak was built on the ruins of Thebes, one of the capitals of ancient Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Its huge temple is dedicated to the god Amon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tourism in Egypt has faltered since early 2011, when a popular uprising toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak after three decades in power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Years of instability and a rising tide of attacks claimed by jihadists have scared off would-be visitors, damaging the economy and sending Egypt's foreign currency reserves plunging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Luxor has had to deal with numerous blows, including a deadly hot air balloon crash in 2013 that killed 19 tourists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The town took several years to recover from a 1997 massacre when Islamist gunmen opened fire on tourists at an ancient temple complex, killing 58 foreigners and their four Egyptian guards.</td></tr>
