<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu calls on Palestinian Authority to return to negotiating table</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again distanced himself from his March pre-election comments that ruled out the possibility of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Speaking after talks with visiting German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said he was committed to the establishment of a Palestinian state, calling on the Palestinian leadership to return to negotiations unconditionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I remain committed to the idea that the only way we can achieve a lasting peace is through the concept of two states for two peoples - a demilitarised Palestinian state that recognises the Jewish nation state of Israel," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said he had discussed with Mr Steinmeier the "common quest to move forward on peace with the Palestinians".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I think the only way to move that is through direct negotiations," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority has moved away from these negotiations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Netanyahu sparked international concern when he ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state while campaigning for the March 17 general election but later backtracked on the comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prospects for a renewal of the peace talks, which fell apart in April 2014, look bleak with the lack of trust between the sides exacerbated by the formation of Mr Netanyahu's new hardline coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Tell the Palestinians to stop their campaign to delegitimise Israel," Mr Netanyahu told Mr Steinmeier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Tell them to get back to the negotiating table. Tell them that we should negotiate without preconditions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a meeting in Ramallah with the top German diplomat, Palestinian premier Rami Hamdallah reiterated "the Palestinian leadership's commitment to the two-state solution based on 1967 borders," with East Jerusalem its capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Steinmeier will today travel to Gaza, where large swathes of the coastal territory razed during Israel's 2014 Gaza offensive have yet to be rebuilt.</td></tr>
