<h3>U.S. poultry producers hurting after bird flu discovery</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The virus' discovery in Arkansas is expected to prompt similar moves by up to 40 more countries, and the restrictions are likely to depress prices and hurt U.S. poultry producers, economists said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Top U.S. poultry producers like JBS SA unit Pilgrim's Pride and Sanderson Farms downplayed the risk to operations, but the Arkansas case sent their shares tumbling on Wednesday ahead of an official confirmation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We will see some markets shutting their imports, mainly from that state, but not from the whole country," said Wesley Batista, chief executive officer of JBS SA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fearing the virus' spread, Mexico, Canada and the European Union, along with other importers, on Thursday banned poultry imports from Arkansas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Missouri, Minnesota, California, Washington state and Oregon already face bans or restrictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kansas on Thursday said it was prohibiting the movement of poultry into or out of two counties in a bid to protect its livestock from bird flu found in neighboring Missouri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The quarantines in Cherokee and Crawford countries, which are on the Missouri border, will last until further notice and at least 30 days, according to a statement from the Kansas Department of Agriculture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>China and South Korea have total bans on U.S. poultry exports from prior avian flu cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After recent cases in a handful of other states, the U.S. government on Wednesday confirmed the infection of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu in turkeys in Arkansas, home to Tyson Foods, the world's biggest chicken company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The virus is unlikely to kill enough U.S. birds to offset the drop in overseas demand due to trade bans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While the H5N2 strain poses no threat to humans, according to the USDA, it is deadly to poultry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Avian flu can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, an industry group, said it expected 30 to 40 additional countries to impose new trade restrictions on U.S. poultry and eggs in the $5.7 billion export market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There will be "more product on the domestic market and that will depress prices," said Jessica Sampson, agricultural economist at Livestock Marketing Information Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The United States exports about 20% of the chicken it produces and about 14% of the turkey produced, according to the center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last year, China and South Korea accounted for about $428.5 million in export sales of poultry meat and products, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>With the export market already hit by the strong dollar, "we don't need anything else that would make those exports any softer," said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Shares in Sanderson, Tyson and Pilgrim's Pride were flat to lower on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>So far, viral strains of bird flu have been identified mostly in wild birds and commercial turkey farms, predominantly west of the Rocky Mountains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But the industry has been on alert since Minnesota and Missouri confirmed cases in the past week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Minnesota is the nation's leading turkey producer, while Arkansas ranks third and Missouri is fifth, according to the USDA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The poultry sector fears the virus could spread through the much bigger domestic chicken industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Arkansas is the third-largest chicken producer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Poultry companies have been enjoying large profits recently thanks to high meat prices and declining feed costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In January, Tyson reported operating income of $351 million for its chicken business in the quarter ended Dec. 27, up almost 40% on the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Trade restrictions could drive down prices by 5% to 10% in the United States for dark meat, which makes up the majority of chicken exports, said H.L. Goodwin, a poultry economist at the University of Arkansas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>How poultry companies will handle such pricing woes is not yet known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>At North Carolina-based Butterball, a "limited number" of turkeys from farms in Missouri and Arkansas that supply birds to the company have been diagnosed with H5N2 bird flu, according to a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The company, which accounts for 20% of all U.S. turkey production, declined to comment on its pricing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Tyson also declined to discuss the impact bird flu may have on the company but said no flocks grown for Tyson have been diagnosed with the virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Tyson "has the ability to ship products from multiple states, so we believe we can meet demand for both domestic and global markets," company spokesman Worth Sparkman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>First U.S. case of H5N1 bird flu found in duck in Wash.</td></tr>

<h3>Kerry promotes US investment in Egypt; no new military aid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kerry delivered words of encouragement for Egypt's efforts to attract greater foreign investment, but no new military assistance as demanded by the country's president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) - Secretary of State John Kerry delivered words of encouragement Friday for Egypt's efforts to attract greater foreign investment but no new military assistance as demanded by the country's president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kerry's hands are tied because the Obama administration is undecided about whether to affirm Egypt's progress on democracy and human rights or issue a national security waiver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It must do one or other under the 2015 federal budget to unblock hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid for Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, America's top diplomat said investment was needed to restore confidence in Egypt and provide stability for the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This part of the world is blessed with a stunning amount of commercial potential," Kerry said at an American Chamber of Commerce event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said the U.S., whose companies invested $2 billion in Egypt last year, stood ready to help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kerry attended an Egyptian economic conference later Friday and met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who has been clamoring for U.S. tanks, planes and other materiel held up since the military's 2013 takeover of the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>El-Sissi said earlier this week the logjam was creating the impression that the U.S. isn't standing by the Egyptians as they battle the Islamic State and other extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The country's need for weapons and equipment is "dire," he told Fox News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Kerry had hoped to announce on his three-day trip to Egypt the delivery of F16 fighter jets, according to U.S. officials, who weren't authorized to speak publicly on internal deliberations and demanded anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But no path forward has emerged from multiple White House discussions in recent weeks over funds which were suspended 21 months ago when el-Sissi, then military chief, overthrew Egypt's first democratically elected leader, Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The U.S. has been providing hundreds of millions in counterterrorism assistance to its ally, which isn't stalled as a result of the coup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Egypt says it needs the money to face growing threats from extremists creeping over the border from lawless Libya or operating in the Sinai Peninsula, and the U.S. sees the funds as critical for stability in the volatile Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But Washington cannot provide almost half of its $1.5 billion annual aid package - along with assistance held up from previous years - until it does one of two things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It must certify advances by el-Sissi's government on democracy, human rights and rule of law, or tell Congress the assistance should go through because it is in America's national security interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The administration has reservations about both options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It doesn't want to endorse a post-coup Egyptian crackdown on political opponents that started with hundreds killed in street clashes and thousands jailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There have since been mass trials and death sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The administration is likewise uncomfortable with a national security declaration that would recall the decades of American support for Egypt's former autocrat Hosni Mubarak despite his government's obvious shortcomings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Officials said the focus of Kerry's trip wasn't on military matters but rather the investment conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Top executives from General Electric, Microsoft and other U.S. companies attended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Egypt's economy was rocked after Arab Spring protesters chased Mubarak from power in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>El-Sissi has sought to make the county more conducive for investment and is reforming Egypt's tax code, among other efforts to spur renewed economic vitality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Kerry also met Friday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Jordan's King Abdullah II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>From Egypt, he will travel to Switzerland Sunday for another round of nuclear talks with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Negotiators hope to reach a framework deal by month's end.</td></tr>
