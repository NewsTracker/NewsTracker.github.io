<tr><td>2</td><td>Google creates new company Alphabet, names new CEO "Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable," Google co-founder Larry Page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO - In a major overhaul of how one of the world's most powerful technology companies does business, Google is creating a new publicly traded parent company called Alphabet Inc. that will be run by Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google will become a subsidiary of Alphabet and is getting a new CEO: top Google executive Sundar Pichai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable," Page wrote in a letter included in a regulatory filing on Monday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Alphabet will be a "collection" of companies, the largest of which is Google, Page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Google will be "slimmed down," excluding companies that are not part of its core Internet business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>For example, Google's foray into the life sciences with glucose sensing contact lenses and its focus on extending human life with Calico will not be part of Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Google will still include the businesses that people typically associate with it such as search advertising, Android, YouTube, apps and so forth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related," Page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Longtime Google observer Danny Sullivan saw the creation of the parent company as a positive move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I think this sets up Google to be a much more diversified company," Sullivan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It certainly allows Google to expand its mission. ... It's an excellent way to have multiple companies underneath that run as independent entities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Page is also making room for talented executives to move up in, rather than leave, Google, Sullivan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's a smart way to ensure that you can keep talented executives," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Page will be CEO of Alphabet, Brin will be president and Eric Schmidt will be executive chairman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Google's new chief financial officer Ruth Porat will become CFO of Alphabet and Google's current directors will become directors of Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A "strong" CEO will run each of the Alphabet businesses with assistance from Page and Brin, Page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That includes Google which will be run by Pichai, Page's top lieutenant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well," Page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>As part of the business reorganization, Alphabet will begin "segment" reporting for its fourth-quarter financial results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Google financials will be broken out from the rest of the Alphabet businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google," Page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The news announced after the close of trading on Monday took Wall Street by surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Google GOOG shares rose 6% in after-hours trading on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Google made the announcement after trading ended for the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Google will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The two share classes will remain GOOGL and GOOG.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>S&P Capital IQ analyst Scott Kessler says it sounds like Google is creating a holding company for its different brands and businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"People want a better sense of what Google is and how it's performing, this is a way to do that," Kessler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Kessler also praised the pick of Pichai, who has been a rising star at the Internet, leading to speculation in recent years that he would eventually succeed Page as CEO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Sundar Pichai as CEO is big for a variety of reasons," Kessler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I am sure he has been offered a number of things at other places. To keep him is key."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Page said Pichai was the natural choice to lead Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Sundar "has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our Internet businesses. Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company," Page said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as him to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that."</td></tr>
