<h3>FIFA vote to be held Feb 26; Blatter defies calls to go now (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ZURICH (AP) -- Sepp Blatter will stay in control of world soccer for seven more months after resisting calls to step down immediately ahead of a presidential election, which FIFA decided Monday will be on Feb. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A defiant first public appearance by Blatter since his resignation statement last month began in pandemonium as he was showered in fake money by a comedian who gatecrashed the media conference at FIFA's headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''Where is my security?'' Blatter shouted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The interruption provided an awkward reminder of a far more serious incident for FIFA in May, when the arrest of soccer and sports marketing officials plunged the game's ruling body into its deepest crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jolted by dual American and Swiss criminal investigations into soccer corruption, Blatter suddenly announced four days after being elected for a fifth term that he would leave FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It was not only the pressure of any authorities ... it was also the pressure of political interference and also the pressure of you, media,'' said Blatter, who is a target of the U.S. investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I had to do something very special and I did it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>FIFA's executive committee decided at a meeting Monday on the February election date and Blatter ended weeks of uncertainty by insisting he would not perform one of his renowned about-turns by in fact being a candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''On the 26th of February FIFA will have a new president,'' Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The 79-year-old Blatter, who first joined FIFA 40 years ago, has held onto the most powerful job in world soccer since 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, who lost to Blatter in May, had told The Associated Press earlier Monday: ''President Blatter's resignation cannot be dragged out any longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But while Blatter said he felt ''regret'' about the crises, he insisted he would not be ''abandoning'' the presidency until a successor is elected by the 209 members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Feb. 26 date was seen as a political victory for Blatter over UEFA and other confederations, who thought they had agreement on Sunday for Jan. 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Instead, Blatter and senior vice president Issa Hayatou cited the importance of the second-tier African Nations Championship - a tournament for little-known home-based players - hosted in Rwanda from Jan. 16-Feb. 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Presidential candidates must gain five nominations from FIFA's 209 member associations by an Oct. 26 deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Only former Brazil great Zico and Liberia football federation president Musa Bility have so far expressed their intention to stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Other potential candidates are Prince Ali and UEFA President Michel Platini, who is still mulling over his decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''He loves the fact that UEFA is associated with football on a daily basis and the thousands of matches we organize,'' Platini's spokesman, Pedro Pinto, said outside FIFA headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''FIFA is a more political organization and he is a man of football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Platini welcomed the creation of a reforms task force, which will consider introducing term limits, integrity checks for executive committee members and pay details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Blatter declined repeatedly on Monday to reveal his salary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But Blatter did respond to calls from World Cup sponsor Coca-Cola and former FIFA advisers Transparency International to appoint an independent person to oversee the reforms required to shape the organization's future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The reforms panel will feature two representatives from the Asian, African, European, and North and Central American confederations, and one each from South America and Oceania.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''We must now make sure that the reforms outlined today will be undertaken in a swift and effective manner,'' Platini said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Reformers want FIFA to appoint a respected figure from outside the sport to oversee the next election and reforms of FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general from Ghana, has been mentioned for the role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''The rumors linking Mr. Annan to the FIFA job are just that: rumors,'' Annan's office told the AP, stressing that he is currently ''fully committed'' to other roles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Bility, the Liberian federation head, said he was ''very disappointed'' with the Feb. 26 election date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''It does not reflect the urgency of the situation,'' he told the AP by telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Bility said he is sure he will secure the nominations required to make the ballot.</td></tr>
