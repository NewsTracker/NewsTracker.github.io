<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) -- Dozens of New England Patriots fans filled a parking lot at Gillette Stadium to protest the four-game suspension handed to quarterback Tom Brady over the ''Deflategate'' scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The ''Free Tom Brady'' rally was organized on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many of the fans who gathered on Sunday wore Brady football jerseys with his number 12 on the back and held signs calling on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to rescind the suspension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The penalty was imposed on the four-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback after investigator Ted Wells found it was more probable than not that Brady was at least generally aware of team employees who schemed to let air out of Patriots' footballs prior to January's AFC championship game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Goodell plans to hear Brady's appeal of the suspension.</td></tr>
