<h3>Alderson says multiple factors led to deGrom over Harvey (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Asked whether economics played a role in slating Jacob deGrom to start the New York Mets' home opener next month, general manager Sandy Alderson gave a complex answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>New York is close to a sellout for the April 13 game against Philadelphia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Matt Harvey, returning from an elbow injury that has sidelined him since August 2013, slots in to start the following night, when plenty of tickets are available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''Look, we take a lot of things into account,'' Alderson said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I think the first and foremost is: Does any pitcher deserve to pitch in a game of that sort, and I think that was the primary focus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>You're assuming more people are interested in seeing Harvey pitch than Jacob.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>New York said Monday that Bartolo Colon will start the season opener at Washington on April 6, at 41 the oldest pitcher to start for the Mets on opening day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>DeGrom, the NL Rookie of the Year, follows in the rotation; Harvey is slated to pitch April 9 against the Nationals and April 14 versus the Phillies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Alderson said Harvey understood that because he didn't pitch in 2014, he ''probably should not have been under serious consideration'' for the season or home openers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Harvey said he understood the Mets rationale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''For not throwing at all last year, I'm happy to be playing again,'' Harvey said Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''Whatever is decided on, when I get to throw, I'm going to be excited and all for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Obviously Bartolo throwing 200 innings, getting 15 wins, is well-deserving of opening day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>All that Jacob did last year, he deserves opening day at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Harvey pitched 5 2-3 scoreless innings against the Yankees on Sunday and has thrown 9 2-3 consecutive shutout innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He has a 1.26 ERA with 12 strikeouts and one walk in four starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''Everything feels good,'' Harvey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''The big thing now is getting from 60 pitches to closer to 100.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Colon was 15-13 with a 4.09 ERA last year and at 41 will become the oldest opening-day starting pitcher in the major leagues since April 2006, when 43-year-old Jamie Moyer was on the mound for Seattle and 42-year-old Randy Johnson for the New York Yankees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Colon will be making his seventh opening-day start after taking the mound for Cleveland (2000-02) and the Angels (2004-06).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He will become the Mets' oldest opening-day starting pitcher at 41 years, 317 days, topping Tom Glavine at 41 years, 7 days in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mets manager Terry Collins downplayed the importance of Colon getting the opening-day start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He will be the Mets' fifth different pitcher in five years to start the opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''It's just one start,'' Mets manager Terry Collins said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''I know it's a big deal to a lot of people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>To me it's not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It's one of 32 starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>You go back and look at what Bart did all season long, he earned it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''Harv's going to pitch a lot of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Over his career, he's going to pitch a lot of opening days, but Matt Harvey doesn't really care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Harvey was 9-5 with a 2.27 ERA in 2013 and was the NL starter in the All-Star game that year.</td></tr>
