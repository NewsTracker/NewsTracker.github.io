<h3>Head of Iran's Guard lashes out over Saudi 'treachery'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard has accused Saudi Arabia of treachery against the Islamic world and compared the kingdom to Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The official IRNA news agency quotes Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari as saying Riyadh is "following in Israel's footsteps" and "shamelessly and disgracefully bombing and killing a nation," apparently referring to Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been waging a monthlong air campaign against Iran-supported rebels, known as Houthis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Iran has provided the Houthis with political and humanitarian support but denies arming them.</td></tr>
