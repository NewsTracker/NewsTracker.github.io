<h3>Kenya asks the UN to shut down refugee camp for Somalis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Kenyan government says the Dadaab refugee camp in eastern Kenya has become a recruitment center for the extremist group al-Shabab whose gunmen last week killed 148 people at the country's Garissa College University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ruto said in a rally on Saturday that Kenya must be secured at all costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have asked the UNHCR to relocate the refugees in three months, failure to which we shall relocate them ourselves. The way America changed after 9/11 is the way Kenya will change after Garissa," Ruto said in a statement distributed by his press office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed a sharp response to last week's attack at the university.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kenyan warplanes attacked suspected militant positions in Somalia, and the government said Wednesday that it was freezing accounts of organizations and individuals suspected of financing Islamic extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Al-Shabab militants have vowed retribution on Kenya for deploying troops to Somalia in October 2011 to fight the militant group blamed for cross-border attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The April 2 Garissa University College attack is one of the worst attacks extremists have carried out in the country, second only to the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The opposition has called for the withdrawal of Kenyan troops from Somalia, a call that the government has dismissed.</td></tr>
