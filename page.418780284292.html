<h3>Greece submits official request for IMF loan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece has submitted an official request to the International Monetary Fund for a new loan as it seeks a huge third bailout from its creditors, the finance ministry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We would like to inform you that we are seeking a new loan facility from the International Monetary Fund," Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos wrote in a letter to Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Earlier, talks on tying up a new bailout deal for Greece failed to start as had been expected, with officials blaming security worries for delaying the negotiations with international creditors - who are detested by many Greeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greek government officials had said this week that the talks on the third bailout programme worth up to 86bn would start in Athens today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But representatives of Greece's creditor institutions - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund - said they cannot begin until the right location is found, given the talks' sensitivity and the wide public anger about austerity policies imposed under the first two bailouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There are some logistical issues to solve, notably security-wise," a European Commission official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Several options are on the table," the official said, without giving more details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Greek parliament has already approved two packages of reform measures, a prerequisite for starting the formal negotiations to hammer out details of the new bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, another source close to the talks said Greece had been asked to do more on reforms before top international officials could come to Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The government of leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras held five months of acrimonious talks with the creditors before they finally offered to start talks on a new bailout - and only after the government missed a debt repayment to the IMF and had to close local banks for three weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Tsipras accepted the creditors' terms even though Greek voters had rejected an earlier offer in a referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Athens hopes this time the negotiations will be quick and can be concluded by 12 August so the deal can get parliamentary approval before a bond repayment to the ECB falls due on 20 August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At the moment, only technical talks are under way to sort out logistical issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>One government official said he hoped negotiations with the institutions' mission chiefs could start tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A European Commission spokeswoman said only that negotiators from the institutions, including the European Stability Mechanism rescue fund, were expected to go to Athens "in the coming days".</td></tr>
