<h3>The latest way to pay someone from your phone: Facebook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook users in the U.S. will soon be able to send their friends money using the social network's Messenger app, the company announced Tuesday, March 17, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Facebook's Messenger app will soon let you send your friends money, the latest in a crowded field of services aimed at an increasingly wireless and cashless generation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Services including PayPal, its Venmo unit and the disappearing-photo app Snapchat let you beam money to friends and family using smartphones linked to bank accounts or credit cards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Facebook's entry, announced Tuesday, is free, works with debit cards and is available on Apple and Android mobile devices and on desktop computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The world's largest social network will process the payments and emphasized the service's security features.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Facebook will likely expand internationally after the service becomes available to U.S. users over the coming months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>To send money, Messenger users can tap a new "$'' icon that's next to the buttons that let you send photos, stickers or a thumbs up sign. Then, enter the amount you want to send, tap "pay" on the top right corner and enter your debit card number. To receive money for the first time, enter the card number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Once you add your card number, you can create a pin code that you will need to enter the next time you want to send money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Apple devices that have Touch ID, you can enable this instead and authorize transactions using your fingerprint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>To help allay concerns about security, Facebook noted that it handles more than a million payments transactions on its site every day for its advertisers and game players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Its payments systems are stored separately from other parts of the Facebook network and receive additional monitoring and control, the company said in a blog post Tuesday.</td></tr>

<h3>With powdered alcohol now legal, will campuses say bottoms up or no shot?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Then came the Lime-A-Rita.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And now, Palcohol is giving it a shot in the alcohol industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau approved a new product on Wednesday called Palcohol, a powdered alcohol substance made by the Lipsmark company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Several states are already debating the legality of this product, prompting many students to wonder how this new form of alcohol consumption will impact college campuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to the company's website, the product won't be sold to the public until the summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But safety concerns have lead multiple states - including South Carolina, Louisiana and Vermont - to ban the product preemptively, while others - such as Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts - have proposed obstructive legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Alex Kletz, an Emory University senior and resident adviser of a freshman dorm, says the product raises many safety concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I worry students won't know how to use it just because it is so new," Kletz says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"And once they try to use it, I feel like it could go wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While students take a mandatory alcohol education course before starting their freshman year, Kletz says they likely lack knowledge about powdered alcohol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"My guess is that students would probably (mix Palcohol with) other alcohol instead of water, which would get them even more drunk than it should," Kletz says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"So I think from the medical perspective you're going to get a lot of backlash, a lot more EMS calls."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This is just one of the concerns critics have voiced about Palcohol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Others, such as New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, worry consumers might snort the product, use it to spike drinks or sneak it into venues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In his letter to the FDA, Schumer called Palcohol the "Kool-Aid of teen binge drinking."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On the company's website, creator Mark Phillips addresses these concerns, arguing that his product is just as safe as liquid alcohol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a YouTube video he notes that snorting the product is very painful and asks: "Why would anyone choose to spend an hour of pain and misery snorting all of this powder to get one drink in their system when they could just - oh, I don't know - drink a shot and accomplish the same thing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Jonas Rosen, a Vanderbilt senior, agrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The powdered substance, he says, won't be appealing considering the abundance of liquid alcohol on college campuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"People would be intrigued by it at first, but I don't know if it would really catch on or hold a high appeal because it doesn't seem to offer any greater convenience," Rosen says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rosen, who is of legal drinking age, says he would consider trying Palcohol once for fun but that he prefers sticking to the alcohol he knows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But he says the substance could have other legitimate uses off of college campuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It seems to offer a lot of practicality in terms of weighing a lot less for shipping purposes on airlines - stuff like that," Rosen says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"But I think it only would be really useful in certain settings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Phillips had a certain goal in mind when he created Palcohol - to satisfy the craving he had for a drink at the end of a long hike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>So he set out to create a form of alcohol that wouldn't weigh him - or his backpack - down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Robert Goddard, a professor at Emory Universuty whose Sugar and Rum course delves into the history of the two industries, isn't convinced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He says that the hikers he knows don't crave alcohol at the end of their hikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Instead, Goddard says Palcohol takes away two of alcohol's most important components: water and the brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"To me this thing is a joke because people consume the brand, not the alcohol."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Goddard says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The liquor companies wouldn't be some of the biggest advertisers in the world if the advertising didn't count."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Goddard doesn't think the product will be a hit with consumers, regardless of whether they are liquor connoisseurs or college students looking to have a good time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>And Colgate sophomore Eli Brick agrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>He says he doesn't think this will change the drinking scene at Colgate or any other college campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>While Brick thinks powdered alcohol might be easier to hide from RA's looking to break up a pregame, he says underage students who want to drink will find a way - Palcohol or no Palcohol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"I don't really see the appeal [of powdered alcohol] over just getting liquid alcohol because I don't really think that's a challenge most college students face," says Brick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"There's definitely going to be drinking and underage drinking on college campuses. I don't view this product as a game changer."</td></tr>
