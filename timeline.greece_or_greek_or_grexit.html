<li>For Greece, the short-term pain and turmoil could be extreme whereas the currency union would likely survive the initial shock.</li>
<li>Ironically, a few experts think one of the most devastating outcomes for the euro would be if Greece leaves and, against all expectation, thrives.</li>
<li>A "no" could mean no more loans, leaving Greece little choice but to print its own currency after running out of euros needed to pay government wages and pension and to refloat troubled banks.</li>
<li>For the long term, a Greek exit would disrupt the euro's "Hotel California" principle: that, as the Eagles put it, you can "check out any time you like, but you can never leave."</li>
<li>But that might prove more difficult if Greece was no longer a part of the euro - and did not face external pressure from fellow eurozone states to modernize its economy.</li>
