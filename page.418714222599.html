<h3>Choo hits for the cycle as Rangers rout Rockies 9-0 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DENVER (AP) -- Shin-Soo Choo was simply concentrating on having one more good at-bat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>When his line drive went over center fielder Charlie Blackmon's head, Choo found himself chugging for third base and into the Texas Rangers' record book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Choo's leadoff triple in the ninth inning completed the cycle, and Matt Harrison earned his first win in 14 months as the Rangers routed the Colorado Rockies 9-0 Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Delino DeShields had a career-high four hits and Prince Fielder homered for the Rangers, who won for only the third time in 13 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''A lot better than (Monday) night,'' Texas manager Jeff Banister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Choo, who had three RBIs, doubled in the second inning, homered in the fourth and singled in the fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>When he came to the plate in the ninth he knew he had a chance to get the cycle with a triple against left-hander Rex Brothers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He drove Brothers' 92 mph fastball off the wall in center and headed for third with his teammates cheering him on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''It's not an easy pitcher on the mound,'' Choo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''I hit it well and (thought) maybe he can catch that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was the eighth cycle in franchise history and first since Alex Rios did it Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>23, 2013, against Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Boston Red Sox All-Star Brock Holt was the only other major leaguer to hit for the cycle this season, on June 16 against Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>DeShields needed a home run to match Choo's accomplishment when he came to bat in the ninth, but he struck out against reliever Rafael Betancourt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''I was talking to (Banister) and I said, 'It would be kind of cool if we both get it,''' DeShields said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''He said, 'Don't try to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If it happens, it happens.' My last at-bat I should have taken a chance; I didn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>I was beating myself up about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We got the win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Harrison (1-1) had not won since beating the Rockies on May 8, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Injuries limited him to six starts from 2013-14 and he didn't make his 2015 debut until July 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''The first time I stepped on the mound it was an accomplishment,'' Harrison said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''Tonight was a confidence booster but also showed I can still pitch here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He scattered seven hits over six innings and worked out of several jams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Harrison allowed a leadoff double to Nolan Arenado in the fourth but stranded him at third with a double-play grounder to end the inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Rockies had runners on first and third with two outs in the fifth, but Choo made a sliding catch on Troy Tulowitzki's sinking liner in right to end the threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Choo's catch helped stop Tulowitzki's streak of reaching base safely at 41 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It was the second-longest in team history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''You have the streak, you get to those third and fourth at-bats the focus is still there, even in a blowout,'' Tulowitzki said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Rangers built a comfortable lead against struggling Rockies starter Kyle Kendrick (3-11).</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Choo had an RBI double in a three-run second and led off the fourth with his 12th homer to make it 4-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Choo drove in another run in the fifth, and an error by reliever Yohan Flande allowed Elvis Andrus to score to make it 6-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Fielder's 15th home run in the sixth gave Texas a 7-0 cushion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Rockies were shut out at home for the first time this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''You've done some yard work if you put up a zero in this ballpark, especially against this ballclub,'' Banister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Fielder's single in the eighth gave him 40 multihit games this season, tops in the majors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He is hitting .341, second in the AL behind Detroit slugger Miguel Cabrera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Rangers: LHP Derek Holland (left shoulder strain) threw a bullpen session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>It was his first time throwing since going on the 60-day disabled list April 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Holland threw 35 pitches and plans to play catch Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''We'll see how he feels and make a plan from there,'' Banister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Rockies: OF Corey Dickerson (left plantar fasciitis) was scheduled to play seven innings for Triple-A Albuquerque.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>... RHP David Hale (left groin strain) threw a 25-pitch bullpen session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>It was his second since going on the 15-day DL on July 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Rangers: LHP Martin Perez (0-1, 5.40 ERA) will make his second start since having Tommy John surgery last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Perez pitched five innings in his season debut against Houston on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Rockies: LHP Jorge De La Rosa (6-4, 4.30) is 2-0 with a 3.00 ERA in two career starts against the Rangers.</td></tr>
