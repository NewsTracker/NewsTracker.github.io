<h3>Cockpit voice recorder hoped to unravel &#039;inexplicable&#039; Germanwings crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The development came as French President Francois Hollande, Germany's Angela Merkel and Spain's Mariano Rajoy travelled to the crash site in a remote French Alpine region to pay tribute to the 150 victims, mostly Germany and Spanish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, while Hollande promised that authorities would not rest until the causes of the crash were known, France's BEA air incident investigation bureau said it was still far too early to draw meaningful conclusions on why the plane, operated by the Germanwings budget arm of Lufthansa, went down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have just been able to extract a useable audio data file," BEA director Remi Jouty told a news conference at its headquarters outside Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have not yet been able to study and to establish an exact timing for all the sounds and words heard on this file," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He expected initial analysis in "a matter of days" but that rough read-out could be subject to errors and that more work would be needed for a full interpretation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although he said "words" had been heard on the tape, Jouty would not confirm whether that meant the Airbus A320's pilots were conscious and he gave no details of the recordings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve earlier said a terror attack was not the main hypothesis being worked on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jouty said, however, that no theory could be excluded at this point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While stressing it was too early to form a clear picture, he ruled out a mid-air explosion having taken place and said the crash scenario did not appear to be linked to depressurisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Jouty said the second black box had not yet been found but could not confirm Hollande's remark that its casing had.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Among the new details, he said the airliner had flown in a straight line directly into the mountain - but would not say whether that suggested at the hand of a pilot or auto-pilot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Germanwings said 72 Germans were killed in Tuesday's crash, the first major air passenger disaster on French soil since the 2000 Concorde accident just outside Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Spanish officials said 51 Spaniards were among the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As well as Germans and Spaniards, victims included three Americans, a Moroccan and citizens of Britain, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Iran and the Netherlands, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However DNA checks to identify them could take weeks, the French government said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hollande, Merkel and Rajoy thanked search teams and met residents in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, where the salvaging operation has been set up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Dear Angela, dear Mariano, rest assured ... we will find out everything," Hollande told German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, pledging to get to the bottom of what caused the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"France stands by you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Merkel replied: "It feels good that in a difficult hour like this that we're standing so closely together in friendship. Dear Francois, I'd like to say to you a heartfelt 'thank you' in the name of millions of Germans who are deeply appreciative of this German-Franco friendship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A tribute ceremony took place on a site with a view in the distance of the mountain against which the Airbus crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Earlier, Lufthansa said it could not explain why the Airbus run by its low-cost Germanwings unit crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It is inexplicable this could happen to a plane free of technical problems and with an experienced, Lufthansa-trained pilot," its CEO Carsten Spohr told reporters in Frankfurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Lufthansa said the 24-year-old plane had just on Monday had repairs to the hatch through which the nose wheel descends for landing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A spokeswoman said that was not a safety issue but that repairs had been done to reduce noise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Police and forensic teams on foot and in helicopters investigated the site about 100 km (65 miles) north of Nice where the airliner slammed into mountains in what aviation officials was a sharp descent but not freefall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"When we go to a crash site we expect to find part of the fuselage. But here we see nothing at all," pilot Xavier Roy, coordinating air operations, said of the confetti of debris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Roy said teams of investigators had been dropped by helicopter onto the site and were working roped together at altitudes of around 2,000 meters (6,000 feet).</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Germanwings said it cancelled one flight on Wednesday and was using 11 planes from other carriers for about 40 flights after some of its crew members had refused to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Employees laid candles and flowers by Germanwings headquarters at Cologne/Bonn airport, while Lufthansa and Germanwings staff worldwide held a moment of silence at 10:53 a.m. local (0953 GMT) - the moment the plane went missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Among the victims were 16 teenagers and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>They were on their way home after a Spanish exchange visit near Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"On Tuesday last week we sent off 16 happy young people, with two happy young colleagues, on a journey and what was meant to be a happy trip ... has ended in tragedy," headmaster Ulrich Wessel told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Barcelona's Liceu opera house said two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, died while returning to Duesseldorf after performing in Wagner's "Siegfried".</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Germanwings said on Tuesday the plane started descending a minute after reaching cruising height and lost altitude for eight minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, it did not seem to have simply fallen out of the sky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The A320 is one of the world's most used passenger jets and has a good safety record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>At 24-years-old, the plane was older than many others at Lufthansa, where the average for its fleet is 11-and-a-half years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991 and had clocked up around 58,000 flight hours over 46,000 flights, Airbus said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Carol Friday was spending a few weeks with her son Greig in Europe, before he was to stay on in France where he hoped to teach English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Their family is instead in "deep disbelief and crippled with sadness" after learning the Melbourne pair were among 150 people killed when flight 4U9525 slammed into a mountainside in a remote area of the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The Airbus A320, operated by low-cost carrier Germanwings, a subsidiary of Lufthansa, crashed in the rugged terrain after making a rapid descent from 38,000 feet halfway into its 90-minute journey from Barcelona in Spain to Dusseldorf in Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The passenger manifest included two babies, while 67 Germans, including 16 high school students and two teachers, were also among the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Carol and Greig Friday were believed to be the only Australians killed, although Australian authorities were checking if any dual nationals were aboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>A day earlier, the pair had celebrated Carol's 68th birthday, while Greig was to turn 30 on April 23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"Carol was a loving mother of two, a devoted wife to her husband Dave and a sister to three brothers," the family said in a statement on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The registered nurse, midwife and maternal and child health nurse was a talented artist, the family said, and enjoyed spending time with her local art group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Carol and Greig Friday have been identified as the two Australians killed on the Germanwings plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"She loved to travel and has seen many of the world's greatest sights. Carol loved life! She enjoyed every minute with her family and friends."</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>She also worked in Queensland, an Aboriginal community near Alice Springs and spent time caring for Kosovars in Australia when they fled Albania seeking asylum in 1999.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Greig, who worked as an acoustic engineer before heading for Europe, had just completed a course in teaching English as a foreign language, and was hoping to teach in France in the coming year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"Carol and Greig were enjoying a few weeks holiday together at the start of his European stay," the family said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many, who they loved in return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Read here for more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>French investigators are searching for the reason why a German Airbus ploughed into an Alpine mountainside, killing all 150 on board including 16 teenagers returning from a school trip to Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Helicopters flew over the site where the A320 operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline disintegrated after it went down in a remote area of ravines en route to Duesseldorf from Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Police investigators made their way across the mountains on foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>No distress call was received before the plane crashed on Tuesday, but French authorities said one of the two "black box" flight recorders, the cockpit voice recorder, has been recovered from the site 2,000 metres (6,000 feet) above sea level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>"The black box has been damaged. We will have to put it back together in the next few hours to be able to get to the bottom of this tragedy," French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told RTL radio, adding the box was still viable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Cazeneuve said the fact debris was scattered over a small area of about one and a half hectares showed the plane likely did not explode in the air, meaning a terrorist attack was not the most likely scenario.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>French Civil aviation investigators are expected to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>In Washington, the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident, and any other theory would be speculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Germanwings was cancelling some flights on Wednesday as some crew members had refused to fly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>"There are crew members who do not want to fly in the current situation, which we understand," a spokeswoman for Germanwings said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>"Seeing the site of the accident was harrowing," Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>"We will enable the relatives to grieve on site as soon as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>French President Francois Hollande will visit the area, about 100 km (65 miles) north of Nice, on Wednesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>All options must be looked into to explain why a German Airbus ploughed into an Alpine mountainside on Tuesday but a terrorist attack is not the most likely scenario, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told RTL radio on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Cazeneuve confirmed that the black box that was found on Tuesday was the cockpit voice recorder, saying that it had been damaged but could still be used to find information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>The two Victorians killed in a plane crash in the French Alps are Carol and Greig Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>French investigators will sift through wreckage on Wednesday for clues into why a German Airbus ploughed into an Alpine mountainside, killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren returning from an exchange trip to Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>The A320 jet operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline was obliterated when it went down in a rugged area of ravines on Tuesday while flying over France en route to Duesseldorf from Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>No distress call was received from the aircraft, but France said one of the two "black box" flight recorders had been recovered from the site 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>A person familiar with the recovery effort told Reuters that this was the cockpit voice recorder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Investigators will also need the other black box which records flight data, information that is essential for probing air accidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Civil aviation investigators from France's Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses (BEA) are expected to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon.</td></tr>
