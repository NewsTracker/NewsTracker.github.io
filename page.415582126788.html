<h3>Closing argument scheduled in grandmother's trial over Alabama girl's running death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- A woman facing a potential death penalty in the running death of her 9-year-old granddaughter could be convicted of lesser charges even if jurors believe she was to blame for the girl's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jurors will begin deliberations in the trial of Joyce Hardin Garrard, 49, following final instructions from the judge and closing arguments, set for Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Garrard is charged with capital murder in the 2012 death of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin, who prosecutors say was intentionally run to death as punishment for a lie about candy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If convicted on the capital charge, Garrard faces death or life without parole; jurors would make a recommendation and the final decision would be up to the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The judge has also indicated he will give jurors several options for a conviction on a lesser charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Garrard, of Boaz, testified she had no intention of harming the girl and denied she had forced her to run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Garrard said during cross examination that Savannah wanted Garrard to help her get faster for races at school, and they both ran "a bunch" before Savannah collapsed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jurors could acquit Garrard or also convict her on one of three reduced charges, according to instructions Etowah County Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree said he will deliver before deliberations begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>-Felony murder, which carries a sentence ranging from 10 years to 99 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>State law defines this as an intentional act that leads to a death or a death caused by "extreme indifference."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>-Manslaughter, a felony with a sentence ranging from two years to 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jurors would have to decide the girl died because of a reckless act, but not intentionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>-Criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This could be another option if jurors believe the girl's death wasn't intentional but that Garrard was responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Garrard already has been in jail awaiting trial for three years, and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Prosecutors contend Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson.</td></tr>
