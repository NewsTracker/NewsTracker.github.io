<h3>Egypt's el-Sissi wants a U.N.-backed coalition on Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt is making an ambitious bid to place itself at the center of the fight against extremism across the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Beyond fighting militants in its own Sinai Peninsula, it is trying to organize an international coalition against the Islamic State in Libya and helping Saudi Arabia defend its borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CAIRO - Egypt's president said in a radio interview aired on Tuesday that creating a U.N.-backed coalition was the best course of action to rid Libya of Islamic extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, speaking to France's Europe 1 Radio, said Egyptian air strikes against Islamic State group positions in Libya on Monday were in self-defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The air strikes were in retaliation for the mass beheading on a beach of a group of Egyptian Coptic Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A video of the killings was released late Sunday by a faction calling itself the Tripoli Province of the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Asked whether he wanted to see a U.N.-backed coalition for Libya, he said: "I think there is no choice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He added that any intervention to restore security in Libya should be done with the consent of the country's people and government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We have abandoned the Libyan people as prisoners of the militias. ... The militias have to give up their arms and must work in a civil context. We have to disarm and prevent arms from falling into the hands of extremists," el-Sissi , a general-turned-politician, told the French station in his first public comments after his country's U.S.-made F-16s staged at least two rounds of air strikes in Libya on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"What happened is a crime, a monstrous terrorist crime that our children have their throats cut in Libya and not to react. It's a kind of self-defense accepted by the international community. We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Egyptian attacks drew harsh criticism from Omar al-Hassi, the militia-supported prime minister in the capital, Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This treacherous aggression and the terrorism carried out by the Egyptian air force is a violation of Libyan sovereignty and a scandalous violation of the U.N. charter and international law," said al-Hassi.</td></tr>
