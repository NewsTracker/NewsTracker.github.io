<h3>IPhone 6's popularity drives Apple's China share to record</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kantar Worldpanel ComTech said Thursday that its latest survey of 15,000 people living in Chinese cities showed Apple's market share reached 25.4 percent in the November-January period, up from 20.9 percent a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That was a record for Apple in the world's largest smartphone market, but not enough to catch up Chinese maker Xiaomi, which claimed 27.6 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The research firm said the market share of Samsung Electronics Co. eroded further to 11.3 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was 22.2 percent a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kantar conducts a monthly online survey of the same 15,000 city-dwelling Chinese who are 16 years or older.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Its latest consumer survey sheds more light on the smartphone market in China amid differing figures from market research companies about which manufacturer came out on top after intense competition in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>IHS said Xiaomi was the top seller in China last year followed by Samsung Electronics with 15 percent and 14 percent market shares respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But another research firm Canalys said Apple was the winner for the first time in the last quarter of 2014, followed by Xiaomi and Samsung.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Although the rankings may differ, all the research reflects similar trends: Apple is on the rise in China boosted by iPhone 6 sales and Samsung is likely the biggest loser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at Kantar, said the iPhone 6, released in October, was the best-selling smartphone model in China in the November-January period followed by Xiaomi's RedMi Note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tamsin Timpson, the research company's strategic insight director, said Samsung's China market share was at its lowest level since the company began its smartphone consumer survey in 2012.</td></tr>

<h3>China lowers growth target, promises to open industries</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>China announced a lower economic growth target for this year and promised to open more industries to foreign investors as it tries to make its slowing, state-dominated economy more productive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BEIJING (AP) - China set a lower economic growth target for this year and promised to open more industries to foreign investors as it tries to make its slowing, state-dominated economy more productive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The growth target of about 7 percent, down from last year's 7.5 percent, is in line with efforts to create a "moderately prosperous society," said Premier Li Keqiang in a report Thursday to China's ceremonial national legislature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last year's actual growth was 7.4 percent, the lowest since 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The ruling Communist Party is in the midst of a marathon effort to guide the world's second-largest economy to slower but more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption and services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is trying to replace a worn-out model driven by trade and investment in construction and heavy industry that has left China's air and water badly polluted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We need to maintain a proper balance between ensuring steady growth and making structural adjustments," said Li in the report to the National People's Congress in the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The full session of the 2,964-member NPC usually is limited to endorsing policy decisions already made by the ruling party but serves as a platform to publicize reform initiatives and set a tone for government work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Communist leaders say they are comfortable with the slowdown that President Xi Jinping, invoking an American phrase, has dubbed "the new normal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But in a sign they are afraid of a politically dangerous spike in joblessness, they have tried to spur activity with two interest rate cuts since November and a reduction in business taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Li promised to give entrepreneurs and foreign investors a bigger role in an economy that after three decades of market-oriented reforms still is dominated by government-owned banks, oil producers and other companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Beijing will cut in half the number of fields in service and manufacturing industries in which foreign investment is restricted, the premier said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He gave no details but the change has long been sought by foreign companies that face a thicket of restrictions and feel increasingly unwelcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, James Zimmerman, said in an email its member companies "share the premier's hopes for a stable, fair, transparent and predictable business environment" and look forward to the promised streamlining in regulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>China's growth has declined steadily since it peaked at 14.2 percent in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Much of that reduction was intentional as Beijing tried to cool inflation and a debt-financed boom in construction and investment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Efforts to promote consumer spending have been slow to gain traction at a time when many workers are uneasy about their financial futures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The International Monetary Fund expects growth to fall to 7 percent this year and a Cabinet think tank, the Development Research Center, says growth will decline to 6 percent next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>China's slowdown has cut demand for iron ore and other commodities that drove economic booms in Brazil, Australia and other countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But if Beijing succeeds in building up a consumer market, that could boost demand for other imports ranging from higher-quality food to Hollywood movies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In a separate report, the Cabinet's planning agency promised to "improve the environment for consumer spending" by improving social welfare systems to reduce the need for Chinese households to save so much to pay for retirement and medical care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Li, the premier, warned China's economy still faces problems including a scarcity of credit for private companies and a low level of innovation.</td></tr>
