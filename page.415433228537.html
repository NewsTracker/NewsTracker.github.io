<tr><td>8</td><td>The area would be a new administrative center including government offices, diplomatic missions and housing as well as universities, a technology and innovation park, and 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) of roads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Madbouly did not say what the new administrative center would be named.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The military has already began constructing the road linking Cairo to the new planned administrative heart of the capital, he said.</td></tr>
