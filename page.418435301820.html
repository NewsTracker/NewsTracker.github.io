<h3>Blackhawks send 3-time champ Sharp to Stars in 4-player deal (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DALLAS (AP) -- The Chicago Blackhawks aren't resting easy after their third Stanley Cup championship in six seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Blackhawks made their fourth trade in two weeks, this time sending forward Patrick Sharp - a key part of all three titles - and defensive prospect Stephen Johns to the Dallas Stars for veteran defenseman Trevor Daley and forward Ryan Garbutt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the second major move recently by general manager Stan Bowman, who sent winger Brandon Saad to Columbus late last month after the best season of his three-year career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The sides couldn't agree on a contract before he was set to become a restricted free agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This time, the Blackhawks cleared some salary cap space by sending Sharp, who is due about $10 million in the final two years of his contract, to Dallas and getting the Stars to agree to keep half of the $1.8 million on the final year of Garbutt's deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I think the primary emphasis is more of an old-fashioned hockey trade,'' Bowman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''It wasn't just trying to get space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was also down the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Daley tops that list for Chicago after bolstering his reputation as a two-way player with a career-high 16 goals for the Stars last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dallas is getting a veteran forward in the 33-year-old Sharp to go with a pair of high-scoring young stars in Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn, last season's Art Ross Trophy winner as the league's leading scorer with 87 points (35 goals, 52 assists).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''He will provide leadership for our group, and we love his shoot-first mentality,'' Stars general manager Jim Nill said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sharp had 43 points (16 goals, 27 assists) in 68 games for the Blackhawks, who beat Tampa Bay for the title in six games in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He has 526 points in 745 regular-season games and has appeared in 129 playoff games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''He's been a huge part of our team, and we certainly wish him well,'' Bowman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The 31-year-old Daley spent the first 11 seasons of his career with the Stars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He's set his career high in goals each of the past two seasons and also had a career-best 22 assists last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>His 756 games are second among Dallas defensemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''He's certainly had an uptick with his offensive game,'' Bowman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''We've always marveled at Trevor's ability to skate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The 29-year-old Garbutt had 25 points (eight goals, 17 assists) in 67 games last season and has 70 points in 198 career games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Johns is 23 and was a second-round pick by Chicago in 2010, but he hasn't appeared in an NHL game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He had a career-high 21 points (four goals, 17 assists) with Rockford of the American Hockey League last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This story is corrected to reflect the spelling of a last name to Stephen Johns, instead of Jones, and that the Stanley Cup Final was six games, not seven.</td></tr>
