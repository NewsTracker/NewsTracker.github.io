<h3>Hillary Clinton?s campaign signs lease for Brooklyn Heights</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton's campaign is coming to Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With Clinton set to launch her presidential campaign, her team has signed a lease to house its headquarters at One Pierrepont Plaza in Brooklyn Heights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sources said Clinton's campaign signed the lease on Wednesday and can move in Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The signing of the lease, first reported by Politico, starts a 15-day clock for the election team to notify the Federal Election Commission of the creation of a campaign committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That means Clinton will likely officially announce her candidacy by April 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton's team had also eyed locations in Queens and Westchester County, people familiar with their search said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton's campaign is expected to occupy two floors, approximately 80,000 square feet, in a building where Morgan Stanley and the employees of the Brooklyn U.S. Attorney, currently Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch, have offices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The offices are near a dozen subway lines and the building touts itself as "Modern Offices. Brooklyn Cool."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But critics said the campaign's location in an office building some call the "Morgan Stanley building," in one of New York's richest neighborhoods, is hardly edgy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's located just a short ride across the bridge from Wall Street," America Rising, a pro-Republican political action committee, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This is all terrible news for Elizabeth Warren Democrats!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The building is owned by Forest City Ratner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Executive chairman Bruce Ratner, who developed the nearby Barclays Center, has contributed $400,000 to Democrats, Bloomberg News reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ratner has never contributed directly to Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A Clinton spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
