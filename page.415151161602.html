<h3>Judge James Munby's fury at ?23,000 to translate notes into Slovenian</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A judge ordered that the man had the right to read 591 pages of reports about the case that will decide the future of his eight-year-old daughter - who lives 1,000 miles away from him in England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The cost of translating the papers, said by a district judge to be 'essential', amounted to just over 10p a word or 38 a page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bill for the father - who speaks no English - was condemned yesterday by the country's most senior family judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Sir James Munby said it was 'impossible to justify'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He warned lawyers who protest about cuts to legal aid that it was 'no good complaining that public funds are available only for X and not for Y if money available for X is being squandered'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sir James, president of the High Court's Family Division, said it was only necessary for the father to be able to read 51 pages of documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But translating even the slimmed-down bundle of legal and social work papers is still likely to cost taxpayers around 2,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The case will decide the future of three children of a Warwickshire woman who are in state care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The oldest is the daughter of the Slovenian man, but Sir James said 'little of the documentation relates to or refers to him'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, a district judge in Coventry, who was not named in Sir James's ruling, decided in a hearing in November that the father could not make his views known in court 'until he has had the opportunity of considering the papers'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The district judge ruled that the father should be able to read more than half of the nearly 1,000 pages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But Sir James said the 591 pages to be translated included 23 pages of Warwickshire council's legal applications; 16 of court orders; 17 of immigration reports on another person; 32 of transcripts of recordings of the children; 131 of statements by the mother; and an index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'I could go on,' he said, adding: 'Why are these pages in the bundle at all?' He criticised lawyers who let files of court documents grow to the length of a novel, and said they should be no longer than 350 pages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The High Court judge warned lawyers who put bigger files before the court that they may have their fees docked, their papers destroyed, or be ordered to start the work again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'Public funds, whether those under the control of the Legal Aid Agency or those under the control of other public bodies are limited,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last month, Sir James attacked the failure of the legal aid system to provide a lawyer for two parents with learning difficulties from Swindon trying to stop their three-year-old son being adopted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said the refusal to grant aid, on grounds of the father's 800-a-month earnings, was 'neither compassionate nor even humane'.</td></tr>
