<h3>Live from Beijing, it's Saturday Night? China wants own version of 'SNL'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's hard to imagine a Chinese version of "Saturday Night Live" -- could mainland censors really abide sharp satires of President Xi Jinping or private-parts-in-a-box jokes?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nevertheless, online video portal Sohu.com is going to try to make a go of it by producing its own Mandarin-language version of the late-night NBC show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sohu already carries the American version of "SNL," but the show lags behind many other American programs in terms of popularity, perhaps because the comedy is so culturally specific.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Localized versions of the "SNL" format have been made in Italy, Spain, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sohu announced plans Tuesday to adapt the format for mainland China, working with Lorne Michaels' Broadway Video Entertainment, which handles licensing for "SNL."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The portal said it would be recruiting comedians and writers in China, but would have "consultants" from the original "SNL" team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Producers have yet to decide whether the show will be taped or streamed live, and whether it will be 90 minutes like the American version, or shorter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Chinese version of "SNL" is expected to debut late this year or early in 2016, Sohu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sohu said it hoped the Chinese version of "SNL" would have "international appeal while still being tailored for Chinese audiences."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But political humor in China remains tightly controlled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The recent new year's gala on state-run China Central Television featured some anti-corruption bits, but those were aligned tightly with the Communist Party's current anti-graft campaign and planned in conjunction with propaganda authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Organizers of the gala -- an annual affair that is the year's most widely watched TV show -- said propaganda officials had decreed "three no's" for the program: No vulgar content, no low-brow content and no artists with histories of drug use or other personal problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>(Such red lines, if in effect for "SNL," would have chased the program off the air long ago.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Wall Street Journal reported that propaganda officials monitored every rehearsal for this year's gala and nixed a number of acts deemed to be "too entertaining," according to a CCTV staff member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The gala, particularly the anti-corruption comedy routines, was panned by viewers, who took to social media to denounce the bits as unusually boring.</td></tr>
