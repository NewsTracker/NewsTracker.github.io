<h3>Nepal landslide blocks river, raises fears of flood reaching India</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, May 24 (Reuters) - Nepali authorities urged thousands of villagers on Sunday to move to safety after a landslide likely triggered by recent earthquakes blocked a river, raising fears of a devastating flash flood, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The landslide at Ramche village in Myagdi district, about 140 km (90 miles) northwest of Kathmandu, struck on Saturday night and blocked the Kali Gandaki River.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>A second quake hit the mountainous country on May 12, killing scores.</td></tr>
