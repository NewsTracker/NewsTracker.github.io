<h3>Logano defends Bristol victory to hold off Gibbs drivers (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRISTOL, Tenn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- As Joey Logano circled Bristol Motor Speedway, he'd briefly glance in the mirror to watch Kevin Harvick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Logano had taken the lead on a restart with 64 laps remaining, but Harvick was closing in by using a completely different line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Refusing to get rattled, Logano stuck to what worked for him Saturday and won the Bristol night race for the second consecutive year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It was kind of interesting to watch it in the mirror, I was watching him drive in and I was like, 'He's going to get me eventually,''' Logano said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It's so interesting how we ran such different lines and be the same speed on the racetrack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>We both found what works for us, and I really thought we were going to be able to pull away because I thought we were really good in the long run and then we didn't pull away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Logano has won on a superspeedway in the Daytona 500, on the road course at Watkins Glen and now Bristol's short track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He has won twice this month as he readies for the start of the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There are two more races before the playoffs begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''We are hitting it at the right time, that's for sure,'' Logano said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''I feel like we are right where we need to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Logano led 176 laps, second only to Joe Gibbs Racing driver Kyle Busch, who led a race-high 192 laps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''Our team just executed,'' Logano said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''That's what we did and that's what we do every week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Harvick finished second for the 10th time this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The reigning Sprint Cup champion has a career-best 17 top-five finishes this year and had his 250th career top-10 finish in 526 starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''Obviously, you want to win races, but we're in position and feel like we can get that momentum swing at any point,'' Harvick said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''Just really excited to be able to run like this at Bristol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Many believed JGR would pick up its 10th win of the season, particularly after Denny Hamlin, Busch and Carl Edwards swept the top three spots in qualifying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Then Busch won Friday night's Xfinity Series race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Although Busch dominated early, he had faded a bit as the laps clicked off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Then he was hit with a speeding penalty on the final round of pit stops and finished eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Edwards led 74 laps but had a tire go flat when he was out front and it cost him two laps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''Damn,'' Edwards said on his radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''All right, we'll still get this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He finished seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Matt Kenseth, the winner for JGR in the spring race at the track, had no chance to sweep the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>An engine issue 177 laps into the race ended his night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He finished 42nd and said he had no warning that his engine was faulty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''They never warn you, it would be cool if they would send you a text or something,'' Kenseth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''It broke in the middle of the straightaway - it had that hop and that noise that it makes when you know you dropped a valve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That left Hamlin to carry the banner for JGR.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He finished a team-best third, but said he just didn't have the same speed as Logano and Harvick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Asked if had expected to see JGR and Toyota celebrating once again, he noted that practicing in the day at Bristol doesn't always translate to the night race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Still, he said, ''Did I expect it?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>It was shaping up to be a strong night for Michael Waltrip Racing's two drivers, who are both adapting to this week's decision to close the organization at the end of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Clint Bowyer has secured his release from his contract and is looking for a new job, along with teammate David Ragan, who has been filling in for Brian Vickers since Vickers was sidelined with health issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Both were running in the top-five on a restart when Jimmie Johnson pinched Ragan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>As Ragan dipped low to get away from Johnson, Ragan drove directly into Bowyer's path.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Bowyer was also hit by Brad Keselowski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Ragan spun across the track and hit a retaining wall, while Bowyer was able to save his car but still suffered enough damage that he needed to go to pit road for repairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He restarted 12th, but Ragan was forced behind the wall for extensive repairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Bowyer rallied to finish fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>''I'm sick to death about that,'' Bowyer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Still, Bowyer hung on to the final transfer spot into the 16-driver Chase field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>With two races remaining to set the field, he's in good shape barring a collapse or another driver bumping him by picking up their first win of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The winless drivers who are currently in position to make the Chase are: Jamie McMurray, Ryan Newman, Paul Menard and Bowyer.</td></tr>
