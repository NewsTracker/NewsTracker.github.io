<h3>Unionist parties' plan for election pact still in limbo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>And while the parties are still talking, the First Minister said progress has yet to be made on agreeing a joint strategy in both the knife-edge East and South Belfast constituencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The DUP is determined to win back East Belfast after losing to Alliance's Naomi Long in the 2010 Westminster election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Robinson has acknowledged that time was running out to agree a pact with the Ulster Unionists but insisted the parties were still talking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's never over until it's over and we're still talking, so I think we concentrate on trying to get some agreement on key seats," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His party colleague Simon Hamilton said that negotiations were at a critical moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is a once-in-a -generation, several generations, opportunity for parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Work needs to continue over the next number of days on a few critical seats where we think we can actually maximise a return for unionists," Mr Hamilton told the BBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Belfast Telegraph reported on Saturday that the prospect of a deal in which the DUP runs in East Belfast and the UUP in South Belfast is looking increasingly slim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, the UUP is still arguing for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt yesterday accused the DUP of using the media "to try to intimidate me into changing tack" and said the party should "turn off the media microphones" and "get back in the room" to negotiate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Without an understanding, the chances of Belfast having no unionist representation after the election are high. That is not acceptable to me, nor should it be to anyone who cherishes the Union," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Nesbitt added: "The fact is that last time the people of our capital city went to the polls, they elected 13 DUP councillors and seven Ulster Unionists. That is a 2:1 split, and that surely signals how we should jointly approach the three winnable Belfast seats in May. If the DUP want to talk we remain ready."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In an interview with today's Belfast Telegraph, Naomi Long spoke of her determination to hang on to her East Belfast seat which she won from Peter Robinson in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She said she has entered every political contest as "the underdog" but has won her "fair share of elections".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I'm not preparing myself either to be an MP or not be an MP from May 7. I'm doing the job I have now and I will deal with the consequences of May 7 on May 8," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Robinson is not a candidate for the East Belfast seat this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The party is running former Belfast Lord Mayor Gavin Robinson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>However, our exclusive survey, carried out by polling partners LucidTalk, also found that the Alliance Party is close enough to close the gap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Conducted in early February, the poll revealed that Gavin Robinson was polling 21.2%, compared with Mrs Long's 17.7%.</td></tr>

<h3>John Kerry says Netanyahu speech to Congress is becoming a 'political football'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Secretary of State said he did not want the Israeli's Prime Minister's forthcoming address to a joint session of Congress to become 'some great political football'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu's speech, organized by John Boehner, the Republican House Speaker, was set up without the blessing of the Obama administration - and comes as the White House tries to strike a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It is feared that such a public show of closeness to Israel, a firm foe of Iran, could dash Obama's hopes in the negotiations, in which he hopes to curb the nuclear program in exchange for easing economic sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kerry played up U.S.-Israeli unity in an interview on Sunday for ABC's This Week show, insisting 'the prime minister of Israel is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There is, however, a clear different in policy between Netanyahu and the White House - with the Israeli leader expected to urge Congress to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions by keeping up the current sanctions regime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Congress wants to keep the sanctions regime strong, but the President has said he would veto any new penalties to preserve the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kerry reiterated Washington's determination to pursue negotiations with Iran, saying the White House deserved 'the benefit of the doubt' to see if a nuclear deal could be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By accepting an invitation from the Republican party to address Congress on Tuesday, the Israeli leader infuriated the Obama administration, which said it was not told of the speech before plans were made public in an apparent breach of protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Solemn: Netanyahu has claimed his visit is above the political, and says he is standing up for all Jews by visiting Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But both sides have tried to downplay the rift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu did not repeat those remarks as he departed on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Israeli prime minister, who is running for re-election in a March 17 ballot, has framed his visit as being above politics and he portrayed himself as being a guardian for all Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'I'm going to Washington on a fateful, even historic, mission,' he said as he boarded his plane in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'I feel that I am an emissary of all Israel's citizens, even those who do not agree with me, and of the entire Jewish people,' he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Netanyahu is expected to use his speech to urge Congress to approve new sanctions against Iran despite Obama's pledge to veto such legislation because it would jeopardize nuclear talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>U.S. officials fear he is seeking to sabotage the Iran diplomacy, and critics have suggested his visit is an elaborate election stunt that will play well with voters back home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>While White House and Israeli officials insist that key areas of cooperation, from counter-terrorism to intelligence to cyber security, will remain unaffected, the divide over the Iran talks has shaped up as the worst in decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Previously Israel has always been careful to navigate between the Republican and Democratic camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The planned address, however, has driven a rare wedge between Netanyahu's government and some congressional Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Some two dozen or more of them plan to boycott the speech, according to unofficial estimates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Iran itself has weighed in on the speech as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Speaking in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Netanyahu of trying to undermine the nuclear talks in order to distract from the Palestinians' unresolved bid for an independent state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'Netanyahu is opposed to any sort of solution,' Zarif said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Meanwhile a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 'politicized' nature of his visit threatened 'what undergirds the strength of the relationship'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>As one former U.S. official put it: 'Sure, when Netanyahu calls the White House, Obama will answer.</td></tr>
