<h3>Egypt court suspends parliamentary elections after earlier ruling deemed law unconstitutional</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The decision by Judge Yahia Dakrouri of the Administrative Court was expected after the high court's ruling last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The country's election committee later will set a new date for the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Supreme Constitutional Court's ruling declared the law defining voting districts unconstitutional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The government is working on amending the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Supreme Election Committee said in a statement earlier that it is setting up a new timetable for elections whenever the law is ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was not clear how long it will take for the amendments to be written, but voting for a new parliament is expected to be delayed for at least several weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The parliamentary vote initially was set to take place in phases beginning on March 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is the final phase in a transition period following the 2013 ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi by the military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Egypt has not had an elected legislature since 2012, when the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that parliament's lower chamber was not constitutionally elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Islamist supporters of Morsi - who was the president at the time - besieged the court ahead of a hearing in which a similar ruling against the upper chamber was expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The first two steps of the transition following Morsi's ouster were the adoption of a new constitution by referendum in 2014 and a presidential election, which former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi handily won.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood swept the first free parliamentary elections after the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The group is now officially considered a terrorist organization, and thousands of its members, including most of its top leaders, are imprisoned.</td></tr>
