<h3>Apple Music's Free Trial Is Half Over. How's It Doing?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>About halfway through Apple Music's three-month free trial period, people are already dumping the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Consumer research firm MusicWatch found that of those who tried Apple Music, 48 percent aren't using the service currently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A managing partner of the firm added, "In terms of benchmarking Apple Music, 40 percent of iOS users are buying digital downloads from iTunes, suggesting trial of Apple Music could be higher. That's the disadvantage of not being the first mover in a market."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This means that people have already made up their minds and decided Apple Music doesn't compare to the familiar bond with whatever service they were using before Apple Music appeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earlier in August, Apple's senior vice president told USA Today the service generated some 11 million users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company's goal, at the time, was to eventually reach 100 million subscribers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple might need to lower its goal a bit - especially if the group surveyed for this report, which was only about 5,000 people, is representative of the rest of the pack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Apple could still see additional subscribers when it gets its Apple Music beta for Android off the ground sometime in the fall.</td></tr>
