<h3>?Live-streaming apps dominate buzz at SXSW</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The five-day festival is not yet half over, but buzz-worthy trends are already emerging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Here's a look at top topics so far at the annual gathering of the Technorati.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An app called Meerkat is dominating conversations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The simple app allows people to live stream anything at the touch of a button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The app used to let users automatically Tweet live streams too, but that came to a stop after Twitter confirmed Friday it acquired Periscope, a Meerkat rival, for undisclosed terms and limited Meerkat's access to Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Meanwhile, rival live-streaming app Stre.am is a finalist for SXSW's innovation awards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some major political figures are using the festival to call for online activism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Former Vice President Al Gore gave a rousing talk about the need for urgent action on climate change on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gore called upon SXSW attendees to get involved in supporting climate change legislation ahead of environmental talks in Paris in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a keynote on Saturday, Princess Reema Bint Bandar Al Saud of Saudi Arabia discussed her efforts to bring women into the workplace and announced a new breast cancer awareness campaign that will rely on social and mobile media to spread the word in the Middle East, including the Twitter-ready hashtag #10ksa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Often in the Middle East, "a woman doesn't want to admit unhealthy status," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There are larger cultural issues involved to talk about breast cancer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Promotions are everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>HBO's "Game of Thrones" is employing pedicabs with Iron-Throne seats and hosting "SXSWesteros," an event site that serves a "Game of Thrones" beer and allows fans a chance to sit on the show's Iron Throne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Meanwhile, smartphone battery pack maker Mophie created buzz with St. Bernard dogs that "rescue" festival-goers low on batteries when they tweet a plea for help to Mophie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The dogs, all locally owned by people in Austin, are part of the St. Bernard's Rescue Foundation, which was created to raise awareness about rescue dogs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"People don't get exposure to St. Bernard's ever," said Mophie spokesman Kevin Malinowski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"People get them as puppies when they're so cute, but once they grow up they can't handle them, so this is almost an education."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A documentary about actor Russell Brand, called "Brand, a Second Coming," was a headliner for the film portion of the festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Brand was set to appear at the Friday premiere and give a talk as well as discuss his daily YouTube show "Trews," in which he talks about news topics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But that day Brand announced on his blog that he wouldn't appear at the festival, saying he was uncomfortable with how the documentary turned out, and backed out of the talk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I apologise sincerely to the organisers of SXSW for my non-attendance, especially Janet Pierson, Brian Solis and Rynda Laurel from the interactive festival who were responsible for the keynote talk that I was due to do," he wrote in the blog post.</td></tr>

<h3>Oboist Reclaims Mozart's Lost Contemporaries</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Does the name Jan Antonin eluh mean anything to you?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It doesn't register even to most classical music geeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Albrecht Mayer would like to change that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mayer, the Berlin Philharmonic's principal oboist, chose a concerto by eluh and works by three other forgotten 18th-century composers for the new album Lost and Found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mayer solos in the concertos and conducts the Kammerakademie Potsdam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>How did he discover these neglected composers?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Online, of course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At least that's where his research began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I found myself in some really mysterious, obscure places," Mayer told NPR's Arun Rath, "like in university libraries all over the world. And I discovered so many interesting pieces which were never edited, never recorded, and so I developed the idea I should visit these places personally."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One of the libraries Mayer visited was in the Polish city of aw, where he thought he found a new piece by Mozart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I opened the first page, and it was so beautifully drawn and colored, and it was really like a masterpiece," Mayer says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"And then I opened the second page to see the start of the score, and suddenly I realized, 'Oh, it might not be a masterwork. It might not even be Mozart.' And 30 seconds later I discovered it might not be interesting for me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Mayer did end up finding plenty that was interesting - concertos by contemporaries of Mozart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Like Ludwig Lebrun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They knew each other," Mayer says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They had been friends. And I think this concerto already points into the future, towards a direction of the early Romantic music."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Lebrun wrote this concerto in G minor in 1777, the very year Mozart wrote an oboe concerto of his own, which remains lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And then there's the Bohemian Joseph Fiala, another friend of Mozart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"He was working in Salzburg in the famous Hofkapelle, in the best orchestra there," Mayer says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"He was a cello player and an oboe player, and this concerto is very demanding, so he must have been very good."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Another gem Mayer found in Poland was by Franz Anton Hoffmeister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>So if their music is so good, why did these composers, regarded in their time, fall into the cracks of music history while others went on to immortal fame?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Life isn't fair," Mayer says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>And sometimes you need a little intervention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Without the Forman movie Amadeus," Mayer says, "nobody would be talking about Antonio Salieri nowadays. I'm sure that eluh and Fiala are much better composers than Salieri."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A few people, Mayer says, just make it - blessed by the gods or by fate to be immortal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And others die, only to become neglected along with their music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"They are kind of victims of musical history," Mayer says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Some of them are rediscovered, and some still sleep somewhere in their little graves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Deceptive Cadence covers the world of classical music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Hosted by Tom Huizenga and Anastasia Tsioulcas, it's an open space for discussion, discovery, music listening and news.</td></tr>
