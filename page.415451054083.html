<h3>A Sydney mother's stand against homework</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>We pick a realistic number of tasks, usually about half of what is set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(Much to my daughter's disappointment, the maths worksheet remains on the to-do list).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On the few occasions I've mentioned my homework rebellion to other parents - I don't tend to telegraph it for fear of judgment - there are some raised eyebrows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Most don't realise it's possible to push back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the state education department does leave the way open for parents to "discuss alternative strategies" if they don't agree with the school's homework policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I get it that some parents wouldn't approve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One argument is that homework sets up lifetime study habits and helps with self-discipline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But at best, there's conflicting evidence from research to support this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>(When it comes to high school, the benefits of homework are much clearer).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Another argument from the pro-homework camp is that parents can track what their kids are doing at school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Well, I get plenty of information from parent teacher meetings, and folders stuffed full of work are sent home regularly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I simply don't want school time to bleed into home time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For me school is school, home is home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There's too much else going on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>My daughter is in the school band and two different choirs - it's her choice and she loves it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She also does swimming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Added up, that's almost a whole extra school day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And more importantly, every minute she spends scratching her head over a matrix literacy task, is a minute less that she could be playing in the backyard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Free play is usually the first activity to be pushed down the priority list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It's infuriatingly unstructured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It can't be scheduled within neat half-hour blocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It relies on the alchemy of a couple of kids, space and make-believe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It doesn't seem to achieve anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But it does, and I will fight to protect that precious time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It's also important that my kids help set the table for dinner and entertain their baby brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>I think this falls under the key learning area of "life skills".</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And the most valuable literacy 'homework' of all?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Reading a book for sheer pleasure - preferably flopped on the lounge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Now that's a lifetime habit to encourage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>What's surprising is how little I have to press my case with the teachers during my annual homework meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>They nod in sympathy at my nervously delivered spiel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>They know how much kids need to rest and reboot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But they all say the same line: "The other parents would complain if we didn't give homework."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>This is a very curious situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Well-intentioned schools give homework to satisfy the parents who demand it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Well-intentioned parents make their kids to do homework because they think it's the right thing to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>And where are the kids in all this?</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>There's no consensus that homework lifts academic performance in the primary years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>There's conflicting research about whether it has any other benefits at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>This is probably why the Department's homework policy leaves a lot of wriggle room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Schools can opt out, and parents can "discuss alternative strategies".</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>It recommends a bit of homework but not too much - but doesn't specify how much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>I'd like to see something much clearer, for the sake of our kids.</td></tr>
