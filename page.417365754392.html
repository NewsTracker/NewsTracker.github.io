<h3>Facebook Can Finally Support GIFs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A link to a GIF from any supporting website will now play perfectly when pasted into your Facebook status bar or in a comments or reply section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Until now, those that wanted to share a never-ending, looped low-resolution image on the site needed to use a workaround from Giphy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, after a near two-year wait, Facebook has now tweaked its code sufficiently so that support for GIFs is native.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And while it means that a link for a GIF, hosted on sites such as giphy, tumblr or Imgur, will play on Facebook when the link is pasted in, it doesn&#x2019;t mean that the social network now supports direct GIF uploads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But it&#x2019;s a start.</td></tr>
