<h3>U.S.-Egyptian released from Egypt jail-family</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO, May 30 (Reuters) - An Egyptian-American jailed in Egypt for nearly two years for involvement in the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood has been released and is headed for the United States, his family said on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mohamed Soltan was among thousands detained after Islamist president Mohamed Mursi was toppled in 2013 by the military under Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is now president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An Egyptian court had condemned Soltan's father, Salah, to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"By the grace of God, we are incredibly happy to confirm that Mohamed is on his way home after nearly two years in captivity," wrote Soltan's sister Hanaa on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"After extensive efforts, the U.S. Government has successfully secured Mohamed's deportation back home to the U.S., mercifully concluding this dark chapter for Mohamed and our family."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The family has run a campaign to free her 27-year-old brother, who had been on hunger strike in detention and has appeared emaciated in photographs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His U.S. citizenship meant U.S. officials had called for an end to his detention, citing concerns about his health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The United States welcomed his release on Saturday, with a State Department official saying: "We believe this step brings a conclusion to this case and we are glad Mr. Soltan will now be reunited with his family in the United States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A court said Mohamed had supported the Islamist movement and transmitted false news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His family denies he was a member of the Brotherhood, unlike his father, who was a senior figure in the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"As you can imagine, after spending several hundred days on hunger strike, and many months in solitary confinement, Mohamed's health is dire," said Hanaa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He will receive medical treatment as soon as he arrives on U.S. soil and will spend the immediate future with his family recovering."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>After toppling Mursi, Sisi launched the toughest crackdown on Islamists in Egypt's history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Security forces killed hundreds at street protests and jailed thousands of others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The White House had condemned Mohamed's life sentence, which in Egypt would typically mean 25 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hanaa told Reuters in April that her brother, who had studied at Ohio State University, had hoped for peaceful change in Egypt following the 2011 overthrow of long-term president Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Egypt has declared the Brotherhood a terrorist group and accused it of carrying out bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Brotherhood says it is a peaceful movement committed to democracy.</td></tr>
