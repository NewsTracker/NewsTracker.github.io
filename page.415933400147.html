<h3>Verlander headed to DL for 1st time in big league career (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander is headed to the disabled list for the first time in his major league career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Tigers said Thursday the 32-year-old right-hander won't be on the active roster for Monday's opener against Minnesota because of tightness in his right triceps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He was scratched from his Thursday start and no timetable has been announced for when he will pitch again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I think they used the word strain,'' Verlander said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Verlander has been throwing lightly in an attempt to work out the tightness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I don't think this is going to be a long-term issue,'' Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Detroit will make his DL stint retroactive, making it possible the six-time All-Star could start the sixth game of the season, on April 12 at Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''If he does start on that Sunday, essentially he doesn't miss a start,'' Ausmus said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''Obviously it's a little more of a story because I've never been on the DL,'' said Verlander, who has started 30 or more games in each of the last nine seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''At least I can take solace in the fact that I'm going on the DL to help the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Verlander is 28-24 in two seasons since starting a $180 million, seven-year contract, slowed by core muscle surgery before the 2014 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Winner of the 2011 AL MVP and Cy Young Awards, Verlander was 124-65 before the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''I don't think I'm going to lose anything moving forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's not like I'm going to come back after taking off for a few days and it's not there anymore,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''There's no point in pushing it too hard to be ready for day one, especially if that sacrifices the long haul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Detroit said reliever Bruce Rondon also will start the season on the DL because of tendinitis in his right shoulder.</td></tr>
