<h3>Apple CEO Tim Cook blasts new 'anti-gay' laws that 'enshrine discrimination in state law'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook has spoken out against two new laws in Indiana and Arkansas which critics say will allow business owners to refuse service to homosexual customers based on 'religious liberty'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cook condemned the laws, saying they were 'very dangerous', went against the founding principles of America, and would take the country back to the days of 'Whites Only' signs in shop doorways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cook, 54, who came out as gay in October last year, made the comments in an op-ed for the Washington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law,' Cook writes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'On behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cook also drew upon his background growing up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s, during and immediately after the Civil Rights movement when blacks were still heavily discriminated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He says America's days of discrimination' must remain 'deep in the past'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This is a value that Cook says is in the heart of his company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Indiana's religious freedom act says that the state and local government 'may not substantially burden a person's right to the exercise of religion' unless that burden is 'essential' to furthering a government interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It will be up to the courts to decide what counts as 'substantial', but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states, and were actually signed into federal law by Bill Clinton in 1993.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But opponents, including Cook, claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'Apple is open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love,' he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in Indiana, which has been fiercely defended by Gov. Mike Pence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the aftermath of the bill's passing, Pence said there was a 'tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding' about the law be says defends 'religious liberty'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Facing the firestorm of criticism, Gov. Pence told the Indy Star he will support legislation to 'clarify' that the controversial law does not promote discrimination against gays and lesbians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The NBA, WNBA, the Indiana Pacers, and Indiana Fever issued a joint statement Saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Proud: Cook pictured center, attending last summer's San Francisco Gay Pride Parade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Website Angie's List also announced plans to cancel a $40 million expansion to its Indianapolis headquarters because of the new law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's CEO Bill Oesterle said in the statement.</td></tr>
