<h3>Report: Court sentences US-Egypt citizen to life in prison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MENA reported Saturday that Mohammed Soltan was found guilty on charges of financing an anti-government sit-in and spreading false news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Soltan, the son of a prominent member of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was arrested in August 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He's been on a hunger strike over his detention for more than 14 months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The court also upheld death sentences for 14 people, including the Brotherhood's leader, and sentenced 36 others beside Soltan to life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The case is rooted in violence that swept the country after the military-led ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, a Brotherhood leader, in 2013.</td></tr>
