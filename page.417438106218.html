<h3>Greek ruling party forces withdrawal of IMF rep</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Greek bailout negotiator says she will not accept the post as the country's next representative to the International Monetary Fund, after nearly a third of lawmakers in the governing left-wing Syriza party said they opposed the appointment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Former World Bank employee Elena Panaritis said in a statement Monday that she was "unable to accept the appointment" because of the opposition within Syriza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is struggling to reach a deal with bailout lenders to restart vital loan payouts, but also faces opposition within his own party to a potential agreement that would extend austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a letter to the government, 44 of Syriza's 149 parliament members described Panaritis as a "leading representative of bailout policies."</td></tr>
