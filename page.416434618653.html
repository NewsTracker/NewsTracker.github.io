<h3>Kenyan police say suspect caught surveilling president home</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - A Kenyan court on Wednesday granted police 15 days to hold and interrogate a man who is suspected of carrying out surveillance on President Uhuru Kenyatta's rural home in preparation for an attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutor Daniel Karuri told a court Wednesday that police require more time to interrogate Said Mire Siyad, who was found in the presidents home in Gatundu South in central Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Karuri said time is needed to extract mobile phone data from the suspect's phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The respondent is believed to have been sent to the presidential resident to carry out surveillance for a terrorist attack," the prosecutor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Preliminary investigations show the suspect has other associates who are yet to be arrested, Karuri said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kenya security forces have increased the frequency of arrests of people suspected of involvement in extremism since four gunmen from the Somali extremist group al-Shabab killed 148 people earlier this month at a college in Garissa, Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Siyad was among eight other suspects arrested for alleged links to extremism who police presented in court Wednesday to ask for more time to investigate them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Human rights activists have accused police of making mass arrests without evidence each time an extremist attack occurs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Most of the suspects arrested in the mass sweeps are usually released by courts due to lack evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Al-Shabab militants from Somalia have vowed to carry out attack in Kenya for deploying its troops to Somalia to fight the militant Islamic group.</td></tr>
