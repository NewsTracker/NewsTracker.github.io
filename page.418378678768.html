<h3>Boko Haram offers to swap kidnapped girls for detainees</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Protesters take part in the "Bring Back Our Girls" campaign in the capital city of Abuja.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's Boko Haram extremists are offering to free more than 200 young women and girls kidnapped from a boarding school in the town of Chibok in exchange for the release of militant leaders held by the government, a human rights activist said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The activist said Boko Haram's current offer is limited to the girls from the school in northeastern Nigeria whose mass abduction in April 2014 ignited worldwide outrage and a campaign to "Bring Back Our Girls" that stretched to the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new initiative reopens an offer made last year to the government of former President Goodluck Jonathan to release the 219 students in exchange for 16 Boko Haram detainees, the activist said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The man, who was involved in negotiations with Boko Haram last year and is close to current negotiators, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters on this sensitive issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fred Eno, an apolitical Nigerian who has been negotiating with Boko Haram for more than a year, said "another window of opportunity opened" in the last few days, though he could not discuss details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said the recent slew of Boko Haram bloodletting - some 350 people killed in the past nine days - is consistent with past ratcheting up of violence as the militants seek a stronger negotiating position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Presidential adviser Femi Adesina said on Saturday that Nigeria's government "will not be averse" to talks with Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Most wars, however furious or vicious, often end around the negotiation table," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Eno said the 5-week-old administration of President Muhammadu Buhari offers "a clean slate" to bring the militants back to negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In May, about 300 women, girls and children being held captive by Boko Haram were rescued by Nigeria's military, but none were from Chibok.</td></tr>
