<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu asked to form Israel's government</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Masked Palestinian militants from the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the armed wing of the Fatah movement, perform drills in Gaza on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jerusalem: A week after his party came out on top in national elections, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been formally asked to form Israel's next government, his fourth since 1996.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>President Reuven Rivlin made the decision after meeting this week with members of more than a dozen political parties to hear them out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Factions representing a majority, 67 lawmakers in the 120-seat parliament, backed Mr Netanyahu as the next prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israeli law does not oblige the president to assign the task of forming the government to the party that won the largest share of votes, in this case Mr Netanyahu's Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Mr Rivlin noted that "in a democracy, the majority decides, and the majority spoke its piece clearly in these elections".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies won last week's general election in Israel by a considerable margin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Netanyahu won the nation's trust and the "heavy responsibility to form a stable, as broadly based a government as possible, and swiftly", the president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Rivlin identified three main issues as the new government's immediate tasks, each implying criticism of Mr Netanyahu's previous policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Against the backdrop of the deepening rift between Israel and the US administration, Mr Rivlin urged the new government to prioritise "fortifying relations between Israel and the US, the biggest and most important of our friends".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A elderly Palestinian this week walks past a building in Gaza damaged in last summer's Israel-Hamas war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He also called on Mr Netanyahu to restore public trust in the political system, after the outgoing government collapsed and turbulent elections were held two years ahead of schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We cannot have elections again in another two years", Mr Rivlin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Rivlin also said the new government must heal the wounds in society aggravated during the recent election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"From every direction, things were said which ought not to have been said - not in a Jewish state, and not in a democratic state," the president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Netanyahu has expressed regret for warning about Israel's Arab citizens going to the polls "in droves" on election day, but the controversy lingers in Israel and abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Accepting Mr Rivlin's appointment to form the next coalition, Mr Netanyahu thanked Israeli citizens for their trust, pledged to "mend the rifts" between different segments of society and called for the nation to put election divisions behind it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Netanyahu said that "Israel's hand remains extended in peace to our Palestinian neighbours" but that security was the basis for hope of a genuine peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Referring to relations with the US, Mr Netanyahu said: "We deeply value the alliance with our greatest of friends and will act to preserve it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>At the same time, he pledged to continue efforts to prevent an "emerging deal with Iran that endangers us, our neighbours and the world".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Netanyahu will have several weeks to negotiate with potential members of his coalition to reconcile demands over appointments and ideological positions and ensure a stable government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The government was expected to be based on Likud and five smaller parties, including hawkish, religious or right-leaning factions that Mr Netanyahu refers to as "natural partners".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's next government could face an uphill diplomatic battle with the international community on the Palestinian issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In addition to the widening gap between the White House and Mr Netanyahu, Israel may be facing pressure from the European Union concerning policies in East Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Construction plans for Jewish developments in East Jerusalem have been a constant source of tension between Israel and the US and Europe, especially announcements that have come at particularly sensitive times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A government planning committee meeting scheduled to advance approval for the construction of 1500 apartments in Har Homa, a large Jewish project on land annexed to Jerusalem after the 1967 Middle East War, was cancelled to avoid attracting further international pressure while the government was being formed, according to Israeli news reports.</td></tr>
