<h3>'Smartest cruise ship' -- robots, skydiving</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The cruise ship cost a whopping $1 billion to build, can take 4,500 passengers on board and has a top speed of 22 knots (41 km/h).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Among its many innovative features is a bionic bar where paying customers key in their orders into an iPad and have their drink made up by a robotic arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Up to 14 guests at a time can enter a viewing capsule, known as North Star, which rises to 300 feet above sea level and gives a bird's eye view of life on deck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Rides are free except at sunset and sunrise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If the thrill of being on the ocean isn't enough, those on board can experience the thrill of skydiving without jumping out a plane with Quantum's RipCord by iFLY.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And for those with a more water-based interest, a surf simulator gives people the perfect opportunity to practice their skills in the waves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Indoors, there are similarly a multitude of different activities, including bumper cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The restaurant area, with every type of food available, looks more like the inside of a grand shopping mall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Among the eating experiences is Jamie's, a chain of celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, who was on board to offer his services for the maiden voyage in November 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For those passengers looking to win back their money from the cost of the trip, there is no shortage of gaming machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The outside pool is a feature both in the daytime and also at night, when it is lit up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There are no shortage of places in which passengers can sit, unwind and have a drink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The vessel itself is registered in Nassau, in the Bahamas, but will be based in South East Asia for the latter part of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>(CNN)Robots serve you drinks, you can skydive on deck and a mechanical arm hoists you 300 feet into the air to view the ship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>You could be forgiven for thinking you had been transported into the future on board the new $1 billion cruise ship Quantum of the Seas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As its name suggests, it is very much a quantum leap in boat building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The latest brainchild of Royal Caribbean, which has branded the newest member of its fleet the "smartest cruise ship in history," it is basically a fun palace on the high seas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Everything, it seems, is a first: the first bumper cars, skydive simulator and bionic bar on a ship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And among the 19 restaurants on board, there is something for everyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Such are the maverick creations on board from bow to stern, it is a vessel befitting of the Mad Hatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This is the smartest cruise ship," says Harri Kulovaara, executive vice-president of maritime at Royal Caribbean and head of the design process behind the project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"This is probably going to be a big change for the industry and the future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And this is not just Royal Caribbean's prediction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"It's unique and unusual, and we just had fun -- pure and simple," is the assessment of Carolyn Spencer Brown, the editor of Cruise Critic, after spending eight days on Quantum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Royal Caribbean are always raising the bar when it comes to putting stuff on board you'd never thought you'd see on a cruise ship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"They just do things well before anyone else and their ships are traditionally the ones you get most excited about," adds Spencer Brown, who estimates she has been on 300 cruises as part of her job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"You keep on thinking when they come up with something crazy they've hit the wall and there can't be anything new, but there always is. They keep doing things no-one else has thought of."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>There are bigger cruise ships out there: Allure and Oasis -- both part of the Royal Caribbean fleet -- although not quite with the same box of tricks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Kulovaara likes to think Quantum has something for everyone -- it even has its own "godmother," American actress Kristin Chenoweth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But what exactly does a price tag of nearly $1 billion buy you?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The vessel is 16 stories high, has room for 4,500 passengers and a 1,500-strong crew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It also boasts 18 decks, 2,090 state rooms, is the length of 41 London buses and weighs 167,800 tonnes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Built in Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, its first voyage at the end of last year was from Southampton to New York, and an eight-day Caribbean cruise on board starts from $1,333.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The project was first discussed in 2009 and the build took three and a half years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Finland-born Kulovaara, now based in Miami, takes great pride in the fact the vessel was delivered just two minutes late.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Kulovaara, who has been with the company since 1995, is proud of the open-thinking mentality that appears to have gone into the design process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"I don't remember any major elements that we did not get on the ship," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"It's come together nicely. We have a group of people that love to innovate and look to the future. With this, we started to think about the next generation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"When we start a new design, we think of the customer and what can we do. We put the customer right in there. How can we provide a better vacation? We constantly explore novel options, what's possible on a ship. We have people pushing innovation that just have that in their DNA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>That involves bringing partners on board, including the team behind RipCord by iFly -- provider of skydiving on the deck in an enclosed capsule -- which has long been a company aspiration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"We've actively looked at having that on board before the technology was not enclosed and also too noisy," adds Kulovaara, who spent his childhood summers sailing in the Finnish Arctic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>It was the same for the North Star, a capsule -- modeled on the London Eye -- that gives holiday makers a 360-degree view of the deck but can also protrude over the side of the boat with just the sea below.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>It is not something for vertigo sufferers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"North Star looks simple but it's very complex so adding to the ship design was huge," explains Kulovaara, who says he only got involved in studying naval architecture in order to make him a better yachtsman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"Some of our best resources were working on that for 18 months before the product was started."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>At the Bionic Bar, passengers can order drinks by iPad and watch as huge bionic arms make any beverage of their choosing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The tech thrills don't end there: Kulovaara claims Quantum has the most advanced WiFi on board any ship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The company is confident it is winning the cruise wars, and reviews of the vessel have, to date, been very positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>There are, however, rivals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Spencer Brown cites the examples of both Norwegian Cruise Line and Carnival for their own innovations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"Norwegian has this completely nuts rope course on deck 16 with a gang plank which looks down over the sea. They were also the first for alternative restaurants and led the way with outdoor spaces and great party areas with bars and restaurants outside," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"Carnival are doing some fun design work with Carnival Vista (launching in 2016). It's like a ship within a ship with a separate family zone and a Cuban-themed area for adults.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>"So Royal Caribbean are leading the way but it's nice to see it's got competition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>There is a pressure on Royal Caribbean to raise the bar for its next creation, though Kulovaara is not concerned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"This is about 1% great idea and 99% execution," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"History tells us that we like to push the envelope and will continue to do that and create very unique experiences."</td></tr>

<h3>News24.com | Missouri judge appointed to take over Ferguson court</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Missouri Supreme Court said it is assigning state appeals Judge Roy Richter to hear all of Ferguson's pending and future municipal court cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The high court said Richter also will have the authority to overhaul court policies to ensure defendants' rights are respected and to "restore the integrity of the system".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ferguson Municipal Judge Ronald J Brockmeyer resigned on Monday, saying through a spokesperson that he was stepping down to promote public confidence in the court and help Ferguson "begin its healing process."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Ferguson City Council met in closed session Monday evening, but members left without taking questions and a city spokesperson didn't disclose the purpose of the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III declined comment to The Associated Press afterward except to say that the city on Tuesday would begin seeking Brockmeyer's permanent successor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Richter will take charge of the court on 16 March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Supreme Court said it also is assigning staff from the state court administrator's office to aid Richter in reviewing Ferguson's municipal court practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Judge Richter will bring a fresh, disinterested perspective to this court's practices, and he is able and willing to implement needed reforms," Chief Justice Mary Russell said in a written statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The change comes after the Justice Department released a report last week that cited cases of racial profiling and bigotry by police and chided what it described as a profit-driven municipal court system in the predominantly black St Louis suburb where Brown, 18, was shot by a white Ferguson police officer in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The shooting prompted protests in the St Louis area and across the nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A St Louis County grand jury and the US justice department both declined to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Justice Department report said Wilson acted in self-defense when he shot Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the Justice Department said Ferguson's police and court systems functioned as a money-making enterprise that heightened tensions among residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The federal report noted that Ferguson was counting on revenues from fines and fees to generate $3.1m, or nearly one-quarter of its total $13.3m budget for the 2015 fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Although it was rare for the court to sentence people to jail as a penalty for city code violations, the justice department report said the city's court almost always imposes monetary penalties and then issues arrest warrants when people fail to pay on time or miss a court date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As a result, relatively minor violations can - and frequently do - lead to arrests and jail time, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The federal report also cited several instances in which Ferguson's municipal judge, court clerk or city prosecutor helped "fix" tickets for colleagues and friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The report cited the forgiven tickets for Ferguson officials as evidence of "a double standard grounded in racial stereotyping".</td></tr>
