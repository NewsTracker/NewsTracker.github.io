<h3>Islamic State video shows killing of teen accused as Israeli spy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The video, published by the group's Furqan media outlet, showed Musallam, 19, sitting in a room wearing an orange jumpsuit, talking about how he had been recruited and trained by Mossad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said his father and elder brother had encouraged him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After that, it showed Musallam being escorted to a field and then being shot in the head by a boy, described by an older, French-speaking fighter as one of the "cubs of the caliphate".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage, which also appeared on Twitter feeds used by Islamic State supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israeli security officials said they were aware of the video but could not confirm that it was authentic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The video, about 13 minutes long, showed Musallam on his knees when the boy armed with a pistol and wearing a military uniform fires one bullet into Musallam's forehead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The boy then fired three more shots into his body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the video, Musallam said he had joined Islamic State to report to the Israelis on weapons caches, bases and Palestinian recruits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Israel and his family denied that he was an Israeli spy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>An Israeli security official had said Musallam went to Syria to fight for Islamic State in October last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Musallam's father has denied his son was a spy, saying a month ago that his son had gone missing while on a tourist trip to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Said Musallam and the youth's mother, Um Ahmad, wept at their home in East Jerusalem when they learned of his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Clutching her son's photograph, Um Ahmad told reporters: "A spy of 19? How is that possible? Why would he have gone there if he were a spy?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Said Musallam said his son had been trying to return home when he was captured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He accused the militants of forcing his son to say he was a spy before killing him just for show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Mohammad was told by them to say about himself that he works for the Israelis," Said Musallam said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"They took him as a victim, only to show the world, so the world would be afraid of them."</td></tr>

<h3>Indonesian jihadis could be strengthened by return of Isis fighters, analyst warns</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>If fighters were to return from Syria with combat experience and increased legitimacy, it could give local terrorist groups "a real oomph", the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, Sidney Jones, told the Lowy Institute on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Terrorist groups are currently splintered and weaker than at any time since the 2002 Bali bombings, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 1998 downfall of the Suharto regime followed by the attacks on nightclubs that killed 202 people were "the peak of the strength of terrorist organisations in the region", Jones said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They really believed the Bali bombings with the political upheaval that had taken place would bring about a religious revolution in Indonesia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead the attack led to a government crackdown and the creation of an effective police counter-terrorism unit, Detachment 88, which steadily saw Indonesian jihadi groups splinter and their recruitment rates dive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Indonesians began travelling to Syria to fight in mid-2013, the former International Crisis Group analyst said, and their numbers have increased rapidly since Islamic State declared its caliphate in July 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There are 127 confirmed cases of Indonesians fighting in the region but numbers could be as high as 200, Jones said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"But there's a long waiting list of people who want to go there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fighters wishing to join Isis or the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra need to win the approval of an Indonesia-based "selection committee".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Initially it was young men who were travelling to the region, enticed by promises of furnished apartments, monthly stipends and training with advanced weaponry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But more recently entire families were crossing the border from Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She stressed it was a "tiny fringe of a fringe of a fringe" who were joining the fight, and that even within Indonesian Salafi jihadist circles Isis was "deeply divisive".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There was at least one known Isis company of Indonesians and Malaysians, which numbered about 100 fighters, who talked about creating a south-east Asian Islamic state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There's no prayer of it happening, but that's the goal," she said.</td></tr>
