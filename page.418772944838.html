<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA to meet sponsors to discuss corruption, reforms Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA will meet its leading commercial partners next month after three of them increased pressure for major reforms to soccer's governing body following a series of corruption scandals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said that Coca-Cola , Visa and McDonald's had written asking for information about what was being done to clean up governance of the sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He admitted that scandal had made it difficult to attract new sponsors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Clearly, there were a number of sponsors, mainly three, its Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Visa, who have expressed and sent a letter to FIFA, asking for information," he told a new conference in the Russian city of St Petersburg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Two or three days ago we received a letter from all of them offering to meet together, so there will there will be a meeting next month."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Criticism of FIFA's governance came to a head in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives over a range of alleged offences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Valcke added that FIFA has been keeping its partners informed of developments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We sent (information) to all our commercial partners, not just those three," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We sent them an update, a summary, of all that has happened within FIFA since 2012 since the first reform process started, (of) what has been changed within FIFA's administration and around FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Definitely, the current situation doesn't help to finalise any new agreements, it's a fact, and I'm sure that until the next election, until February 26, there (will be) no major (sponsorship) announcements."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter is stepping down and a replacement will be chosen in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Valcke also signalled that he would be leaving his job then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Valcke said that despite the current difficulties there was still enough time before the 2018 World Cup, to be held in Russia, to sign up new partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>FIFA's slate of current World Cup sponsors is looking thin as its seeks to fill 34 available slots for two-tournament packages taking in the 2018 event and the 2022 tournament in Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Two top-tier sponsors, Dubai-based airline Emirates and Sony, were among several commercial partners who did not renew last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Only seven of 14 available positions in FIFA's top two commercial categories have been filled, and none of the 20 slots in a new regional category designed to increase revenue from the 2010-2014 tournament cycle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>With some sponsors committed to other big events in 2016 - such as the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and the European Championship - promotional campaigns tied to the 2018 World Cup would typically start after they are finished, Valcke said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The current sponsors have been keen in demanding changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Earlier this month, Coca-Cola urged Zurich-based FIFA to support the creation of an independent body to reform the way it is run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>McDonald's said it had told FIFA that it's internal controls and compliance culture were not consistent with expectations it has for its business partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Visa joined in the criticism on Thursday when it also called for an independent reform commission to be set up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We seek to partner with those who think and act like us," said Visa Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I don't believe that FIFA is living up to these standards."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We believe no meaningful progress can be made under FIFA's existing leadership," the U.S.-based credit card company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>FIFA announced on Monday that it would set up a task force to recommend reforms, however this will be made up of representatives from the continental soccer confederations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Those confederations are also responsible for electing the members of FIFA's executive committee.</td></tr>
