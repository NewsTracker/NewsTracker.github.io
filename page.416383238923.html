<h3>Egypt court sentences 22 to death over 2013 attack on police</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ruling was the latest action against alleged supporters of the ousted Mohammed Morsi, whose Muslim Brotherhood group has faced a violent government crackdown after his one-year rule ended and it was banned and declared a terrorist organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Morsi himself faces a verdict on Tuesday over accusations he was responsible for the killing of protesters while president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The ruling will be the first in several ongoing trials against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Giza court said eight of the condemned were sentenced in absentia on charges that included murder, attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms, destruction of property and vandalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The ruling, which can be appealed, also sentenced a minor involved in the case to 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The attack took place in Kerdasa, a restive town west of Cairo considered a militant stronghold and where gunmen and rampaging crowds have killed policemen in other acts of violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the largest incident, 11 policemen were killed and their bodies mutilated in August 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That September, gunmen killed a police general during a raid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Egypt has been sharply criticized for issuing mass death sentences largely targeting Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Over 22,000 people have been arrested since Morsi's ouster, including most of the Brotherhood's top leaders, as well as large numbers of others swept up by police during pro-Morsi protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Also Monday, a roadside bomb hit an armored vehicle in the northern Sinai Peninsula, killing three soldiers, Egypt's official news agency said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>MENA said the attack was carried out by Islamic extremists early in the day near the border town of Rafah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The team in the armored vehicle was searching for explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Militant attacks, mainly targeting Egyptian security forces, have spiked since Morsi's overthrow, which came after massive protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most of the largest attacks have been carried out in northern Sinai and were claimed by a local affiliate of the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At least 14 people, mostly soldiers, were killed in a wave of attacks in northern Sinai last week.</td></tr>
