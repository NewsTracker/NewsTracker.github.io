<h3>Police probe if woman faked link to crash victim for flights</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (AP) - German police are looking into whether a woman claimed to be a relative of a victim of last month's Germanwings crash to get free flights to southern France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Germanwings parent Lufthansa organized special flights for victims' relatives after the March 24 crash, which killed all 150 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The daily Halterner Zeitung, based in the town that lost 16 high school students and two teachers, reported Thursday that a woman flew to the region twice at Lufthansa's expense after falsely claiming to be a cousin of one of the teachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Markus Tewes, a police spokesman in the town Hoexter, said police are investigating possible fraud and the woman will be questioned.</td></tr>
