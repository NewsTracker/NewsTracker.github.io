<h3>Apple's new plan to make everyone an iPhone user</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple is about to make it a lot easier and cheaper for non-iPhone users to convert to the iOS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The tech giant is planning to launch a new trade-in program that will allow non-iPhone users to trade in their non-Apple device for a gift card that can be used to purchase an iPhone, according to a report from 9to5Mac.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple currently has an iPhone Reuse and Recycle trade-in program, which enables iPhone users to trade-in their older Apple smartphones for credit to put towards a new iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new program would likely work in a similar manner, where the Apple employees would determine the value of the non-Apple device to decide how much credit would be earned to put to a new iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook gives "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer the surprise of his career for his big 10th Anniversary show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to the report, Apple has been training employees in how to determine pricing for the non-iPhones and will launch the program in the next few weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Smartphone sales account for more than half of Apple's total revenue and while the majority of its sales are in the Americas and Europe, the company has seen a boom in demand in developing countries, especially China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Given the high demand in the region, it's likely that a trade-in program for non-iPhones may spur growth even more because it makes the high-priced devices more affordable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</td></tr>
