<h3>Report: Top Clinton Staffers Used Private Email Too</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bloomberg Politics reports that one former colleague said that when Clinton was abroad, "he generally conveyed messages to Clinton through a core group of four senior aides-Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan, Huma Abedin, and Philippe Reines."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>So Clinton's correspondence was being archived, because it was going through staffers with government email - or that's what would have been happening if at least two of the aides on that list weren't using private email as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A source tells Gawker that rather than the @state.gov accounts, Clinton's top staffers "used those Clinton email addresses."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Specifically, the source alleges that Philippe Reines, the former deputy assistant secretary of State, and Huma Abedin, Clinton's deputy chief of staff, used private email while conducting official government business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gawker reports that there are several clintonemail.com addresses linked to Abedin, and an email sent to huma@clintonemail.com on Tuesday did not bounce back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton spokesman Nick Merril said Reines never had a clintonemail.com address, but did not respond to questions about whether he used another non-government email address while working at the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Associated Press has also reported that Clinton owned the server transmitting these private email messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The server was registered to the Clinton home in Chappaqua, New York, by the apparent pseudonym Eric Hoteham.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There are questions about whether Clinton actually violated the law, but the White House made it clear on Tuesday that they are not going to condone her allegedly shady email habits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Very specific guidance has been given to agencies all across the government, which is specifically that employees in the Obama administration should use their official e-mail accounts when they're conducting official government business," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"However, when there are situations where personal e-mail accounts are used, it is important for those records to be preserved, consistent with the Federal Records Act."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A current employee of the department's cybersecurity team told Al Jazeera America that they were well aware that Clinton wasn't using a government email address, and her staff ignored their warnings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We tried," the employee said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We told people in her office that it wasn't a good idea. They were so uninterested that I doubt the secretary was ever informed."</td></tr>

<h3>After Netanyahu?s warnings, U.S. and Iran resume nuclear talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The U.S. and Iranian foreign ministers began a third day of talks over Iran's nuclear program on Wednesday, just hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had warned that the deal being negotiated was a serious mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran's Mohammad Javad Zarif resumed their discussions in the Swiss lakeside town of Montreux, hoping to work out a framework deal by late March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, Netanyahu's controversial speech to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, where he harshly criticized the diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute, will make it harder for the Obama administration to sell the potential deal back home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu argued that rather than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear arms, a deal would "all but guarantee" that it would one day get the atomic bomb, putting Israel, the wider region and U.S. interests at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama responded within hours saying that Netanyahu had offered no "viable alternatives" to the current course of negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Iran and world powers are trying to put a framework agreement in place by the end of the month, despite the misgivings of Israel, U.S. congressional Republicans and some Gulf Arab states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Such an accord would be followed by a comprehensive agreement to be completed by the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The aim of the negotiations is to persuade Iran to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions that have crippled the oil exporter's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The United States and some of its allies, notably Israel, suspect Iran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover to develop a nuclear weapons capability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iran denies this, saying it is for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity.</td></tr>
