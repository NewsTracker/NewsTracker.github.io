<h3>Best Coast, Snoop Dogg and Kanye West are among the acts descending upon SXSW</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>What exactly are these artists seeking at SXSW, which began in 1987 as a kind of low-key regional expo?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The short answer, of course, is buzz - the precious bit of noise needed to stand out in an increasingly crowded field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yet the specifics vary from striver to striver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Here's a look into the minds of some of them as they head to Austin with things to do and people to impress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After two acclaimed indie albums, the L.A.-based guitar-pop group is readying its first major-label record, "California Nights," for release in early May. So although SXSW is familiar territory for Best Coast, which made a splash at the festival as a so-called baby band in 2010, the group is playing higher-profile gigs this year (including a Universal Music Group showcase and a party sponsored by Rolling Stone) that seem intended to boost the act's standing from the underground to the alt-rock A-list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Here's another Californian with product to push: Also due in May, "Bush" will be Snoop Dogg's debut for Columbia Records, which paired the veteran rapper with producer Pharrell Williams for a set likely to emphasize Snoop's drunk-uncle charm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Instead of heading to SXSW as a performer, though, the 43-year-old Long Beach native is scheduled to deliver the festival's keynote address, a task handled in recent years by Lady Gaga, who used the occasion to defend her polarizing "Artpop" album, and Dave Grohl, who went warm-and-fuzzy rhapsodizing about the value of inspiration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>What will this year's talk entail?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Only the Doggfather knows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The adventurous country star just scored his second No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>1 country hit with "Take Your Time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But with a live show that has him covering Destiny's Child and Mariah Carey - not to mention an album that keeps hanging around the upper reaches of the iTunes chart - Hunt appears to have his sights set beyond Nashville domination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>SXSW provides an opportunity to put his shape-shifting music in front of noncountry audiences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This Swedish singer hasn't had any trouble reaching audiences: Her song "Habits (Stay High)," about going to "sex clubs" and "watching freaky people getting it on," peaked at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>3 on Billboard's Hot 100, reflecting sales of more than 3 million copies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>What Tove Lo hasn't quite done is attach her music to a recognizable presence, a la other wild-child Hot 100 habitues like Kesha and Rihanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That may change in Austin, where you can bet she'll work hard to live up to the flamboyant streak in her lyrics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>SXSW still has room for newcomers without any hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>See Summer Moon, a New York-based band so fresh it hasn't released a single tune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Then again, "newcomers" might not be the right word for a foursome that features Nikolai Fraiture of the Strokes and Tennessee Thomas of the Like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Here they'll try to put some songs behind that semi-supergroup status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>This young singer-songwriter also boasts an impressive pedigree: Last year, she toured as a member of Jenny Lewis' road band, a job held previously by such indie-rock success stories as Danielle Haim of Haim and Barbara Gruska of the Belle Brigade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Now Prass is playing SXSW behind her own self-titled debut, which has already won rave reviews for its crafty blend of classic country-pop melodies and lush Old Hollywood arrangements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Can she bring its delicate sound to life in a place well known for devouring attention spans?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>With so many demands on attendees' ears, SXSW rewards savvy recyclers: artists who don't need long to get an idea across precisely because the idea is so familiar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A sharp-dressed soul man in the vein of Sam Cooke or Otis Redding, Bridges expertly revives '60s-style R&B in the handful of tunes he's released from his coming major-label debut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Adele fans tired of waiting for her new album will be ripe for his picking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>What would a major music event be without Kanye West?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The human lightning rod, who last year took part in a Samsung-sponsored throw-down with Jay Z, hadn't confirmed by late Tuesday that he'd be playing a full-on concert at SXSW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But he's scheduled to appear Friday on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," which is taping all week at Austin's Long Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Do you really think the guy would schlep all the way to Texas just for that?</td></tr>
