<h3>Why Airport Security Almost Confiscated Wu-Tang's Secret Album Box</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>I'm a senior editor at Forbes, where I cover the business of music, media & entertainment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>I'm author of the Jay Z biography Empire State of Mind; my business biography Michael Jackson, Inc. was published by Simon & Schuster in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At my day job, I've investigated topics from Wu Tang Clan's secret album in Morocco to the return of tourism in post-conflict Sierra Leone to the earning power of Hip-Hop Cash Kings like Diddy and Jay Z, writing cover stories on subjects ranging from Richard Branson to Toby Keith to Justin Bieber in the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In addition to Forbes, where I started full-time after graduating from Yale with an American Studies degree in 2007, my work has also appeared in The Washington Post, Billboard, Sports Illustrated, Vibe, Hollywood Reporter, McSweeney's and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A recovering child actor, I played the title role in the film Lorenzo's Oil (1992).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For more, check out my website and follow me on Twitter, Google+, Facebook and by signing up for quarterly email updates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The box box that has housed the Wu-Tang Clan's secret album for much of the past year recently arrived at MoMA PS1 in Queens, carried by a white-gloved porter and flanked by security guards-but it almost didn't make it through customs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That was just one of the takeaways from an event at MoMA last night where album producer Cilvaringz joined Wu-Tang ringleader RZA to publicly discuss the album and play a 13 minute sampler in front of a crowd of journalists, art aficionados and lucky fans, all of whom were required to check phones at the door and pass through airport-level security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The two producers explained this would likely be the last time any part of the album was played in public for at least 88 years, which-as FORBES was the first to report-is the period of time during which its eventual buyer will be forbidden from releasing the work commercially.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After reiterating that they decided to release just one copy of the album (dubbed The Wu - Once Upon A Time In Shaolin) in order to make a statement about the intrinsic value of music, the duo gave way to what associate curator Jenny Schlenzka dubbed "the first, the last, the only public listening session" for the record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Packed with pounding beats and the urgent, gritty rhymes that characterized much Wu-Tang's early work, the music fulfilled Cilvaringz's promise that the album would embody the spirit of the group's heyday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There were, of course, a few updates, namely the addition of guests including Cher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One detail that struck an odd chord on the recording, though, were the rappers' exhortations to their expected audience-the sort of "this is for my [insert group here]" lyrics that have long been a hip-hop hallmark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Once Upon A Time In Shaolin, after all, is really just for the lone person who purchases it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The idea behind the one-version release, however, is aimed at a broader audience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>" The end goal is actually the exact opposite of elitism ," said RZA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Yes, the album in itself will only be owned by someone who can afford it. Only one man can hold the scepter. But look beyond the prize and prestige of owning this album and focus on the statement it carries and you'll see that we're trying to re-attach values to music for the benefit of all kinds of musicians."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The MoMA event concluded with a discussion between RZA, Cilvaringz and Genius executive editor Sasha Frere-Jones that bounced back and forth from topics including the group's goals for the album and the unusual logistical concerns associated with transporting a giant silver box from Morocco to New York on a commercial airliner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>According to Cilvaringz, the latter nearly didn't happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the midst of his journey, airport security agents became concerned about the mysterious silver box he was hand-carrying to the U.S. When they asked him to open it, he declined-and had no choice, because the key used to open the box was in Marrakech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cilvaringz said it took three hours before he made it through security-with the help of some calls from the team at Paddle8, the upstart auction house that will sell Once Upon A Time In Shaolin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Though the last backup copies of the album have been destroyed, seizure by airport security likely wouldn't have impacted the eventual sale of Once Upon A Time In Shaolin too greatly: the lone disc sits safely in a vault at the Royal Mansour hotel in Morocco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>For more about the business of entertainment, check out my Jay Z book Empire State of Mind and biography Michael Jackson, Inc. You also can follow me on Twitter, Facebook and by signing up for quarterly email updates.</td></tr>

<h3>U.S. Justice Department finds racial bias in Ferguson police practices</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The investigation into the police department began in August after the shooting of unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson sparked national protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>African-Americans also made up most of incidents in which officers used force and all incidents where police dogs bit citizens, said the official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of African Americans in Ferguson, New York and Cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what President Barack Obama called "simmering distrust" between police and communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The findings are expected to be formally released as early as Wednesday, a Justice Department spokeswoman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The department will use the findings to negotiate policy changes with Ferguson officials and enter a consent decree, or to sue the city to force change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Previous federal investigations into police departments have resulted in such changes as reporting arrest data to the Justice Department and installing federal monitors to oversee operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The report's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But they are unlikely to restore full trust in the Ferguson police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict Brown's killer, officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wilson, who said he acted in self-defense, is also unlikely to face criminal charges in a separate Justice Department investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mayor James Knowles said Ferguson was committed to making improvements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The city has always been committed to making sure we have the very best police department and any training and improvements or reforms we make to help improve service to the community, we are interested in," Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Civil rights attorney Jerryl Christmas, who has represented people who have clashed with Ferguson police and city officials, said he was not surprised by the findings, and he hopes to see Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We already knew all this was going on. The problem is nobody is being prosecuted, nobody has been terminated," Christmas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Jackson did not respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>One email sent by a Ferguson police or municipal court official joked in 2008 that Obama would not stay in office long because, "What black man holds a steady job for four years?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ferguson Committeewoman Patricia Bynes said she was outraged by that and other racially tinged emails found in the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The fact that police officers and municipal court officials are using their public emails to tell racial jokes, that just reeks of arrogance and ignorance," said Bynes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It's astounding. They think they are untouchable. The taxpayers have been paying for that racial bias."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The official said that in Ferguson's court system, African-Americans were less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and made up 95 percent of people held longer than two days in the Ferguson jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Ferguson Municipal Court, which Attorney General Eric Holder has previously criticized for unfairly penalizing the city's poor, issued the majority of its warrants for minor violations such as parking, traffic and housing code violations.</td></tr>
