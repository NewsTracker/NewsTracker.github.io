<h3>Greece offers new proposals ahead of emergency summit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After months of wrangling and with anxious depositors pulling billions of euros out of Greek banks, Tsipras's leftist government showed a new willingness this weekend to make concessions that would unlock frozen aid to avert default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>French President Francois Hollande, on a visit to Milan, confirmed Greece had offered new proposals although EU diplomats said no formal written proposal had arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was not immediately clear how far the new proposal yielded to creditors' demands for additional spending cuts and tax hikes, but the offer was a ray of hope that a last-minute deal may yet be wrangled before Athens runs out of cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A day before emergency meetings including a summit of euro zone leaders in Brussels, Tsipras was holed up in a marathon cabinet meeting and discussed the new offer with the leaders of Germany, France and the European Commission by phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The prime minister presented the three leaders Greece's proposal for a mutually beneficial agreement that will give a definitive solution and not a postponement of addressing the problem," a statement from Tsipras's office said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He is due to meet the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and IMF head Christine Lagarde on Monday morning before the meetings with euro zone leaders in the early afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Elected on a pledge to end austerity, Tsipras has defiantly resisted demands to cut pension spending and is pushing strongly for debt relief in return for any concessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Greek officials have said Athens may be willing to consider raising value-added-taxes or other levies to appease the lenders, who want concrete assurances that demanding budget targets will be met.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There is no time to lose. Every day counts. Talks and negotiations must continue so that an agreement is reached," Hollande told a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Locked out of bond markets and with bailout aid frozen since summer last year, Athens is quickly running out of cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The deputy finance minister on Sunday confirmed Athens had enough money to pay public sector wages and pensions this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But Athens also urgently needs access to funds to avoid defaulting on a 1.6 billion euro IMF loan that falls due at the end of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As the crisis gets pushed from one meeting to the next, each side has put the responsibility on the other's shoulder for finding a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Money has drained out of Greek banks after a breakdown in talks last weekend, and Greece might have to impose capital controls within days if there is no breakthrough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Underlining the pressure to stem the flow of withdrawals, Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras met senior bankers on Friday and told them to brace for a "difficult day" on Tuesday if no deal is reached, two bankers at the meeting told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sources in Frankfurt and in Brussels said the European Central Bank's board would discuss the liquidity of Greece's banking sector at 0830 GMT (4:30 a.m. ET) on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The sources said Greek pre-orders for deposit withdrawals for Monday had already reached 1 billion euros - after savers pulled over 4 billion euros out of their banks last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>European ministers have played down the prospect of a final agreement on Monday but hope a political understanding can be reached in time for a full deal by the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>For a deal to work, Tsipras will need a solution that is acceptable to his party or else may be pushed to call a snap election or a referendum to secure a mandate for an agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Supporters of his Syriza party rallied in Athens on Sunday to send "a loud message of resistance" against demands for more cuts and tax hikes in a country battered by years of recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Under austerity measures imposed by the IMF, the European Union and the European Central Bank in two bailouts, Greece's economic output has fallen by a quarter, wages and pensions have been slashed and unemployment is running at 25 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Greek government has argued the austerity imposed on the southern European country had made the crisis worse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A senior Syriza lawmaker said on Sunday that previous ideas put forward by Juncker would have led to a "social holocaust".</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"Democracy cannot be blackmailed, dignity cannot be bargained," the Syriza party said in a statement on Sunday, announcing its planned protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Workers, the unemployed, young people, the Greek people and the rest of the peoples of Europe will send a loud message of resistance to the alleged one-way path of austerity, resistance to the blackmail and scaremongering."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But the mood has also hardened in Germany, which has contributed more money than any other country to bailing out Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel is under pressure from within her ranks not to give in to Greek demands, even if that means contemplating Greece leaving the euro zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Merkel's Bavarian allies warned against giving in to Greece, with senior Christian Social Union lawmaker Hans Michelbach saying he saw no realistic chance of an agreement on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"If the EU lets the government in Athens get away with its intransigence, we can bury the euro," Michelbach said in a statement on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Either Greece declares itself willing for a viable solution or the country must leave the euro. The euro zone could cope with the consequences of a Greek exit," he said.</td></tr>
