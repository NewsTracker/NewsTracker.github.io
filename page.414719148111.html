<h3>Ukip 'desperately trying' to get selfie-loving Labour councillor Karen Danczuk to defect</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ukip aides have privately admitted they would 'love' Mrs Danczuk - a working-class mother of two, who is married to the outspoken backbench MP Simon Danczuk - to defect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Rochdale councillor has revealed the behind-the-scenes bid to get her to switch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She said: 'I'll still be hanging around and still at the sidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I just want to spend a little bit more time with my boys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'My youngest was one when I first got elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I want bed times, I want to be tucking them in every night, I don't want to be dashing out to meetings at night time for a while, and spend more time with my boys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The revelation that Ukip are trying to poach Mrs Danczuk comes after her MP husband Simon was forced to deny growing speculation that he was considering defecting to Ukip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Rochdale MP, who has previously said Ed Miliband's leadership had been suicidal, was photographed drinking with Nigel Farage at the Anchor Tap pub near near Tower Bridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Danczuk, 48, is defending a majority of just 889, had attacked his party leader for 'torturous repetition of political mantras', warning this is turning voters away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Mr Danczuk said there was 'no chance' he would join Ukip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said: 'Nigel and I met for a few pints to talk about politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At the time Mr Farage refused to discuss whether he had asked Danczuk to defect but said: 'I meet all sorts of people in politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I was particularly pleased to meet Simon Danczuk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mrs Danczuk, meanwhile, has escalated her public spat with Miss Harman - by demanding an apology for calling her a liar over claims she once told her she was 'too pretty to be in politics' and should join a girl band instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Miss Harman allegedly made the remarks after being introduced to Mrs Danczuk for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mrs Danczuk said Miss Harman's pink battle bus exposed politicians' failure to listen seriously to voters' concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said: 'What women voters want from politicians is their concerns heard in a serious manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She told MailOnline: 'It was at a conference in Manchester.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I wanted a photo with her and she said 'you're far too pretty to be in politics'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But Miss Harman rejected the allegation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She said: 'I deny I ever said that and it's inconceivable I would have ever said that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'I have always believed it's what you do in politics, not what you look like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The allegation sparked fresh accusations that Mrs Harman was belittling female voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But Mrs Danczuk said she found the row 'upsetting' because she took the remark as a compliment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>She told LBC's Iain Dale last night: 'It's really upsetting because I actually took it as a compliment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>'It was the conference where Gordon Brown first took over, everyone was excited - really, really happy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>There always is a bit of a disco on one of the nights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'It was the first time I'd ever met Harriet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>So, I went over and said 'Harriet can I have a photograph'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>'She said 'yeah, yeah, of course, yeah'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>So we had a little bit of a chit chat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>She said 'what do you do?' and I said 'I'm a local party activist'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'She said 'oh you're far too pretty to be in politics you should be in Girls Aloud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>I actually took it as a compliment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>'I actually took it as a compliment, I wasn't insulted by it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>I thought thank you that's actually really nice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Of course a women isn't going to be insulted by a compliment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>'But what does upset me is that she is saying I'm lying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>I just think, if you didn't remember saying that to me then just say, 'I don't remember saying that but I'm glad that she's proved me wrong'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>'I'm sure she just thought, young, pretty party activist, give her a little compliment and that will be the end of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>I'm sure she never thought at the time that some years later it would come back and haunt her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>She added: 'Even to this day I took it as a compliment, but I do not appreciate being called a liar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>That's what has upset me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>There was no reason for me to lie about that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>'I think Harriet should apologise, because she is absolutely wrong and she's really upset me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>I don't want it being a massive public spat - I'm telling the truth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Calling me a liar is absolutely wrong and the more she calls me a liar the more I won't let this drop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>'But if she turned up next week in her pink bus and said 'Karen, I'm sorry let's have a talk' I'd definitely welcome it.</td></tr>

<h3>2 Al-Jazeera journalists freed from prison in Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Egyptian judge ordered Fahmy and another Al-Jazeera English journalist, Baher Mohammed, released on bail Thursday as their retrial on terror-related charges continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Two Al-Jazeera English journalists were released from an Egyptian prison on Friday, after spending more than a year behind bars on terror-related charges in a case denounced as a sham by rights groups and the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The two - Mohammed Fahmy and Baher Mohammed - were freed pending a retrial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The network said by midday that they have been reunited with their families in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A third co-worker, Australian Peter Greste, was freed two weeks ago and deported to his home-country, Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Baher was initially sentenced to 10 years in prison and Fahmy to seven years but Egypt's top appeals court subsequently ordered a retrial after overturning the initial ruling, citing "flawed evidence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On the first session of the retrial on Thursday, the judge ordered their release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Now that both are out, their next court hearing is due Feb. 23 and they have to check in at a police station every day until then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Early on Friday, Fahmy's brother tweeted that he posted $33,000 bail to grant his brother's release, following a court decision on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mohammed's wife, Jehane Rashed, told The Associated Press that her husband arrived home around 7 a.m. Photos on Facebook and video aired by Al-Jazeera showed him hugging and playing with his children - one of whom was born during his detention - and wearing clothes with the tag, "Free Press."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I will continue fighting for the freedom of expression, and I will not back off," he said in the video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He was freed without bail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Al-Jazeera reporters spent over 400 days in prison after being caught in the bitter feud between Egypt and Qatar, main backer of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood group, from which ousted President Mohammed Morsi hails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Thursday's decision indicated the court was moving ahead with a retrial of Fahmy and Mohammed, but several scenarios are possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The court could eventually throw out the case, acquit them, convict them but sentence them to time served, or impose more prison time, with the possibility of a pardon from President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Like Australian Greste, Fahmy, who is Canadian, could also be deported but prospects for Baher, who only has Egyptian citizenship, remain murkier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Cairo has signaled it wants to resolve the case and end the criticism ahead of a major economic conference next month to drum up international investment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Egypt's staggered parliamentary elections are also due to start in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The three, who worked for Al-Jazeera's English-language channel, were arrested in December 2013 and accused of belonging to the Brotherhood, which was branded a terrorist organization after Morsi's removal from power earlier that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Since the ouster, Egypt has been cracking down heavily on Morsi's supporters, and the journalists were accused of being mouthpieces for the Brotherhood and falsifying footage to suggest that Egypt faces civil war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They rejected the charges against them, saying they were simply reporting the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They were convicted by a lower court on terrorism-related charges and sentenced to at least seven years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Court of Cassation, the country's highest appeals court, also said in ordering the retrial that the initial proceedings were marred by violations of the defendants' rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Though el-Sissi had rejected calls from the United States and other Western governments to pardon or commute the sentences, he acknowledged last July that the heavy sentences had a "very negative" impact on Egypt's reputation and that he wished they had never been put on trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The journalists and their families say they were caught in the bitter feud between Egypt and Qatar, the Gulf nation that owns Al-Jazeera and a main Brotherhood backer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Egypt's ties with Qatar have since thawed.</td></tr>
