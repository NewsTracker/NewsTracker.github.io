<h3>Battle persists for Ukraine railway hub, despite peace deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Under the agreement negotiated by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, the warring sides were to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That plan already looks at risk, with the rebels saying they are not satisfied that conditions are in place for the process to go ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Associated Press reporters in Luhanske, a government-held town 9 miles northwest of the bitterly contested railway hub of Debaltseve, heard sustained and regular shelling Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some of the artillery appeared to be outgoing, suggesting it was being fired by Ukrainian troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Debaltseve, still in government hands, remains in contention despite the cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The rebels insist the town should revert to their control as it has been encircled by their fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A loaded Grad rocket launcher was seen pointing in the direction of Debaltseve, but it was not fired while AP journalists were present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who are supposed to monitor the implementation of the peace deal, said Sunday that separatists denied them access to Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite the cease-fire that went into effect early Sunday, five Ukrainian troops were killed and 25 wounded in the past 24 hours, Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In New York, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern over the continued hostilities around Debaltseve, urging "all parties to abide by the cease-fire without exception."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The cease-fire had raised cautious hopes for an end to the 10-month-old conflict, which has already claimed more than 5,300 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But Ukraine and rebel officials have already traded multiple accusations of attacks since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Separatist military official Eduard Basurin said in a televised news conference Monday that the government overnight lobbed artillery at Horlivka, a town under rebel control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ukraine, however, blamed that attack on the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The government-appointed police chief of the Donetsk region, Vyacheslav Abroskin, said the separatists shelled the town in order to derail the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Both the separatists and the Ukrainian government insist they are committed to the cease-fire negotiated in marathon talks last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the Russian news agency Interfax quoted Basurin as saying Monday that conditions are not yet ready to pull back heavy weapons Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We will begin pulling back equipment from the line of contact if we receive a certain signal, which is if the Ukrainians also do the same thing," Basurin was quoted as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of arming and supplying manpower to the separatists and have imposed a range of economic sanctions to pressure Moscow into changing course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Russia denies all suggestions it is directly involved in the war in Ukraine, but the sheer amount of heavy weapons the rebels have belies that claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>On Monday, the European Union added 19 more people and nine organizations to its list of sanctioned Russian entities, including two Russian deputy defense ministers, eastern Ukraine-born Russian crooner Iosif Kobzon, who sang to the rebel leaders in Donetsk last year, as well as several separatist commanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted angrily to the decision, calling it "clumsy" in the context of last week's cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The ministry dismissed the new EU sanctions as "running against common sense" and harming chances "to resolve an internal Ukrainian conflict."</td></tr>

<h3>Tractor-Trailer Driver Allegedly Leads Cops On 34-Mile Chase, Chucks Fridge At Them</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A tractor-trailer driver threw items from his cab at police - including socks, shoes and a small refrigerator - as he led them on a 34-mile chase in western Pennsylvania, authorities said Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police in Westmoreland County said a man called emergency dispatchers just before 2 a.m. Saturday and said he planned to wreck his truck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>State troopers tried to stop the vehicle near Washington Township but the driver disregarded the emergency lights and sirens, and a pursuit began along Route 70 and later the Pennsylvania Turnpike, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"During the pursuit, the driver threw numerous items at pursuing troopers from the cab" including a steel canister that struck a Greensburg state police unit and disabled it, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The driver also threw a mini refrigerator before the truck was stopped with spike strips shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The driver refused orders to leave the cab, police said, so troopers entered and used a stun gun to subdue him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was taken to a hospital because officers believed he was under the influence of a controlled substance, namely Xanax, and for other injuries, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It should be noted that during the pursuit the operator threw his shoes and socks at troopers. When the windows were broken to make entry into the cab, the operator's feet were cut during his resistance to arrest," police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At the hospital, he was treated for cuts on his feet, and a blood sample was taken for testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The driver, identified as Christopher Charles Boyer, 47, of Mifflintown, is charged with aggravated assault, fleeing or attempting to elude, reckless endangering, resisting arrest and other counts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Court documents indicate he had requested representation by the public defender's office, which rang unanswered Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>State police told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that Boyer was the only occupant of the truck, which hauls sand used in the hydraulic fracturing drilling process, known as fracking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Police did not disclose his employer.</td></tr>
