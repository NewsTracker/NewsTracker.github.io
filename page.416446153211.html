<h3>Chile volcano erupts for first time in decades</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Santiago (AFP) - Southern Chile's Calbuco volcano erupted for the first time in nearly half a century, spewing a giant funnel of ash 10 kilometers (six miles) into the sky and prompting authorities to declare a state of emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Officials ordered an evacuation for a 20-kilometer radius around the volcano and the interior ministry rushed in the army to temporarily take control of the province of Llanquihue and the town of Puerto Octay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Emergency measures were also in place in neighboring Argentina, where the picturesque city of Bariloche -- about 100 kilometers from the volcano -- said it was anticipating the arrival of ash clouds within hours and warned people to stay at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Puerto Montt, over the border from Bariloche and the largest Chilean city in the area, was already blanketed in a cloud of ash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"People are very, very frightened," said Gervoy Paredes, mayor of Puerto Montt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The situation is pretty complicated," he added, saying reports indicated the Blanco river was flooding because of ice melt triggered by the eruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Airlines canceled flights as the towering, mushroom-shaped ash cloud rose from Calbuco's snowy peak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Schools also suspended classes in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Television images showed large traffic jams and long lines at gas stations in Puerto Montt, where a red alert was declared, along with nearby Puerto Varas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I would like to call on the population to remain calm and stay informed," said Interior Minister Rodrigo Penailillo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The police have given orders and begun to evacuate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The initial evacuation involved about 270 families, but could be expanded, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Police called on residents to keep roads as clear as possible to aid the evacuation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Calbuco had been inactive for 43 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It was a "rather explosive eruption," said Gabriel Orozco, a volcanologist at the National Geology and Mines Service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said the 10-kilometer-high ash cloud risked collapsing, and warned: "River beds are very dangerous at the moment" because of the risk of ice and snow melting and causing floods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The 2,000-meter (6,500-foot) volcano is located in the Los Lagos region, some 1,400 kilometers south of the capital Santiago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It is the second volcano in southern Chile to have a substantial eruption since March 3, when the Villarrica volcano emitted a brief but fiery burst of ash and lava.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That eruption caused authorities to evacuate more than 3,500 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>No lava was seen in the latest eruption, which began around 6:00 pm (2100 GMT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But the ash cloud, which could be seen from 20 kilometers away, loomed over the crater, turning hues of pink and yellow as the sun set over the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Chile has about 90 active volcanoes, of which Calbuco is considered one of the most dangerous.</td></tr>
