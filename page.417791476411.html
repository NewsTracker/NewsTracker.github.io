<tr><td>9</td><td>Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures fell 110 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures lost 27 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Upbeat consumer sentiment and other data added to views the economy may be regaining momentum, which increased anxiety over the timing of a rate raise ahead of this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the central bank's last meeting before September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Economists and top Wall Street banks expect the Fed to raise rates in September, in what could be the central bank's first hike in almost a decade.</td></tr>
