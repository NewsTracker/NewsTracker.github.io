<h3>If Greece Leaves The Euro Then Spain, Italy And Germany Would Follow</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At least that's the claim from the Greek Defence Minister, Panos Kammenos, that if Greece were to leave the euro as the result of some failure of the debt renegotiation talks than Spain and Italy would follow out of the common currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And in the end so would Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's certainly a possible ending to such a Grexit although it would probably be better if Germany were to leave the euro first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Panos Kammenos, Greece's defense minister, spoke to German newspaper "Bild" on Saturday, saying his country's leaving the euro could precede an exit by Italy and Spain, followed by Germany in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"If Greece explodes, Spain and Italy will be next and then at some point, Germany. We therefore need to find a way within the eurozone, but this way cannot be that the Greeks keep on having to pay, "Kammenos told Bild.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As I've been saying for some time now the biggest threat to the continuance of the euro is not that Greece might leave, but that it might leave and then thrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At which point people in Italy will indeed be asking, well, why do we have to suffer all this pain when we could just bring back the lira?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And it is Italy that is really suffering most from the euro of those two countries mentioned, Italy and Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Spain had a huge property boom and then a collapse: yes, largely caused by entirely inappropriate interest rates as a result of being in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But they have also largely done the structural reforms that were necessary to recover from that disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It isn't actually obvious that Spain would benefit all that much from not being in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Italy however is another matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's running a primary surplus, most government debt is owed domestically, yet the low growth and deflation that the euro is causing are leading it to the edges of an irreversible debt spiral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Leaving, bringing back the lira and a reasonable devaluation would be the standard economic answer to this problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It's only the politics of Europe and the irreversibility of the euro that stops this happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As to Germany that country could solve an awful lot of problems if were along to leave the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>For one of the real problems is that whatever currency is in use in Germany today is hugely undervalued with respect to whatever currencies are in use in France, Spain, Italy, Greece and so on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>So, Germany leaving and revaluing would solve the problem quite neatly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Moscovici, a French Socialist, countered the argument that protective mechanisms put in place in the three years since the last major debt crisis meant Grexit - or an inadvertent "Grexident" - could be contained, or even strengthen the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"If one country leaves this union, the markets will immediately ask which country is next," Moscovici told the German magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"And that could be the beginning of the end."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Moscovici's comments reflect alarm in the new Commission formed under Juncker in November that brinkmanship by leaders on both sides of the dispute in the euro zone risks getting out of hand, and a fear governments underestimate the potential damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Exactly what would happen if Greece left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There would indeed be that "who's next" as all realised that the euro is indeed reversible.</td></tr>
