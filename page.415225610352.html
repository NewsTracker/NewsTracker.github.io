<h3>Ringling Bros. is getting rid of elephants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The pachyderms will no longer be packing 'em in to watch "The Greatest Show on Earth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Ringling Bros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>and Barnum & Bailey Circus vowed Thursday to get rid of all elephants in its traveling act - after years of battling lawmakers and animal-rights groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There's been somewhat of a mood shift among our customers. A lot of people aren't comfortable with us touring with our elephants," said Alana Feld, of Feld Entertainment, a parent company of the circus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ringmasters will remove all 13 of the big, friendly beasts from the act by 2018 and take them to a conservation center near Orlando, Fla., the firm said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Of course, we're thrilled. But our primary concern is that three years is much too long," said Delcianna Winders, deputy general counsel for the animal-rights group PETA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company needs time to build new structures for the retiring pachyderms, which cost roughly $65,000 each to care for annually, a circus rep said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Circus-elephant bans in cities such as Oakland and Los Angeles played a role in the company's decision remove the creatures from the show, the rep said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Filed under Animal Rights , Circuses , Elephants , Ringling Bros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Should elephants be in the circus?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>@John Creighton It will be done right away if you pay for it and do it all yourself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If you care that much, don't yap, step up and prove it and take them off their hands and you take care of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Otherwise shut up and stop trying to pretend you really care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>You're either an idiot or just plain ignorant, Nancy Martin!</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Ringling Brothers elephants are not abused?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Do you have any clue how elephants are trained to do circus tricks?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Or are you so stupid as to think they stand on their front legs on small stools, or on their hind legs or even walk in a line holding each other's tails in nature?!</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>These beautiful, sensitive, highly intelligent animals are trained, according to accounts by former Ringling Brothers employees in recent years, by being broken, trained and disciplined using sharp metal hooks, often held against the animals anus to prod them and kept on chains most of their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They are traumatized and often driven to insanity by these cruel practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Is that how you would choose to treat an animal or want that done to you or your children?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It's enough that over 100,000 wild elephants have been slaughtered by poachers in just the past couple of years, driving them near to extinction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>We humans are non-pareiled in our capacity for cruelty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Thoughtful people, who don't want to support further cruelty for our own amusement, are happy to learn of Ringling Brothers decision, though puzzled why it won't be done for three more long years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>@Cal Spence Did you post this to prove what a moron you are?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>How about if we break your spirit and discipline you with a sharp metal stick shoved against your anus to make you work against your will and chain you up each night so your unable to move in a natural way; not even for as long as these elephants have suffered this, just for the next three years until its financially 'comfortable' for us to set you free from the torment?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Would you be okay with that?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>If you can honestly say yes then I'll shut up, otherwise you shut up and stop trying to pretend that you have any humanity!</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Having zoos is inhumane too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Let's get rid of all the zoos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Animal testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Eating meat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>We'll be back to hucking rocks at lions chasing us down for a meal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>How about tigers?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Dogs? Hell, paying people $15 an hour to be a clown is inhumane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Let's get rid of them all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>I think they should replace the elephants with politicians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>They are experienced with circus life and walking around in dung.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Send the retired elephants to DC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>This should have been done decades ago, and they shouldn't stop with the elephants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>These animals lead miserable lives, are abused in numerous ways, kept in chains and cages, forced to do unnatural acts etc. How do people think they get these animals (think big cats) to do these things?</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Tormenting and abusing them pure and simple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Unfortunately, most people just don't care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>As long as their kid is entertained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Truly disgraceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>No, neither elephants, tigers, lions nor horses nor any other animal should be paraded around the way they are in the circus; nor should they be stuffed into train cars or trucks to be carted around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>They should not live in cages or be prodded and mistreated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Do they look happy to be forced to live the way they do; these circus animals have the saddest eyes and a look of hopelessness and fear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>It's awful!</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt interior minister replaced in cabinet reshuffle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Officials said Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim was replaced by another police general, Magdy Abdel-Ghafar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ibrahim was among the top Egyptian officials that Human Rights Watch urged to be probed for "crimes against humanity" over deadly 2013 clashes between security forces and protesters in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An audio recording obtained by Al Jazeera last month suggested that Ibrahim gave the green light for using automatic weapons against protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ibrahim's removal comes after an uptick in bomb attacks blamed on armed groups targeting the heart of the heavily protected Egyptian capital, Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yehia Ghanem, a well-known Egyptian journalist and resident fellow at New York's City University, told Al Jazeera that "the main objective of such a reshuffle is to calm down segments of society angry over eroding security and flagrant violations of human rights".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He also said the fact the reshuffle came just a few days before the country's major economic investment conference showed that Sisi believed political change was needed urgently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The situation in Egypt is getting more critical, because if it was not that critical no sane person would make that reshuffle just days before that very important conference on rehabilitating the Egyptian economy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is the first cabinet reshuffle since Sisi, a solider-turned-politician, took office in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A year ago he led the military ouster of the Mohamed Morsi, the nation's first freely-elected leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Leaked audio appears to show interior minister advising in 2014 on how to shoot protesters without creating "martyrs".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Human Rights Watch says killings were planned at highest levels of government and calls for senior leaders to be probed.</td></tr>
