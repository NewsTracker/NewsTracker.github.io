<h3>Campaigns halt ahead of Greek referendum</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Campaigns have halted in Greece on the eve of a closely watched bailout referendum - with voters in a dead heat over whether to defy creditors and push for better repayment terms or essentially seek new political leadership to find a compromise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Political rallies and publication of new opinion polls are banned 24 hours before Sunday's referendum called by left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has promised to ease austerity after six years of recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Rival rallies took place a half-mile apart in central Athens late Friday, and Tsipras made his final pitch on a stage set up for a campaign rock concert outside parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This is not a protest. It is a celebration to overcome fear and blackmail," he told a crowd of 30,000 as they roared oxi, oxi - "no, no."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 40-year-old Tsipras is gambling the future of his new left wing government on Sunday's snap poll - insisting a "no" vote will strengthen his hand to negotiate a third bailout with better terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If he loses, Tsipras has strongly indicated he would step aside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Athens' high-stakes stand-off with lenders saw Greece default on debts this week, close banks to avoid their collapse, and lose access to billions of euros after an existing bailout deal expired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The EFSF, the Eurozone's rescue fund and Greece's largest creditor, said Friday it considered the country to be in default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At Friday's "no" rally, Athens resident Maria Antoniou held a handmade sign, reading "oxi".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We have to strengthen Tsipras. It's not his fault we are bankrupt," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That is a message the "yes" voters refuse to believe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Police said about 22,000 people gathered outside the nearby Panathenian stadium for the "yes" rally, waving Greek and European Union flags and chanting "Greece, Europe, Democracy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Evgenia Bouzala, a Greek born in Germany, said she was considering shutting down her olive oil export business because of the financial turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rallies for both campaigns were also held in 10 other Greek cities on Friday, and the drama remained high in the final hours of campaigning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The country's top court stayed in session till the late afternoon before rejecting a petition to declare the referendum illegal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A series of polls published on Friday at the end of a frantic week-long campaign showed the two sides in a dead heat, with an incremental lead of the "yes" vote well within the margin of error.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They also showed an overwhelming majority of people - about 75 per cent - want Greece to remain in the euro currency.</td></tr>
