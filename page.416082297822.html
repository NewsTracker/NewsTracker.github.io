<h3>Verlander heads to DL officially, Tigers call up Lobstein (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Verlander is headed to the disabled list for the first time in his major league career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>DETROIT (AP) -- Justin Verlander is officially headed to the 15-day disabled list, and the Detroit Tigers have called up left-hander Kyle Lobstein to take his place in the starting rotation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Tigers announced almost a week ago that Verlander would be going on the DL for the first time in his career, but they did not make the move official until Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The right-hander has a strained right triceps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The team initially thought Verlander might be able to start Sunday at Cleveland, so Detroit wouldn't have to bring up a replacement starter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But manager Brad Ausmus now says he won't be able to pitch in that game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Verlander says his level of concern is ''very low'' and he hopes he won't need to miss more than one start.</td></tr>
