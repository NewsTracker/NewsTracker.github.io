<h3>Kenya: Businessmen, ex-officials charged for fraud and abuse of office</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Eight suspects were charged with conspiracy to commit an economic crime for a scheme to defraud the government of $44.6 million in contracts to modernize police equipment, including computerizing police force operations, according to charge sheets from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two suspects, including a senator, were charged with abuse of office and breach of public trust for the procurement of communication services, said the sheets presented in court by public prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Seven suspects denied charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The others weren't in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two businesses were also charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In 2006, former presidential adviser on corruption, John Githongo, released documents alleging high level corruption in the issuance of 18 contracts dubbed the "Anglo Leasing scandal".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The officials and businessmen were charged Wednesday for their alleged involvement in some of these contracts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An audit of 18 government contracts showed that all were awarded without seeking bids from competitors and suppliers were not required to submit invoices, delivery notes or certificates of completion of works, a local newspaper quoted then Controller and Auditor-General Evan Mwai as saying in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some of the security contracts were awarded to companies whose offices could not be traced at addresses indicated in the agreements, according to the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Githongo has linked the failure to set up the security projects- which were part of the awarded contracts- to the country's struggle to contain extremist attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If the Anglo Leasing security contracts that are still being investigated today 10 years later, hadn't been predated upon, hadn't been 'eaten', we'd (be) far more ready than we are for the potentially existential threat al-Shabab poses to Kenya's State," Githongo told The Associated Press by email from Stanford University, California, where he is a visiting scholar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Al-Shabab extremists from Somalia have carried out 129 attacks in Kenya since Oct. 2011 saying its retribution for the Kenyan troop presence in Somalia.</td></tr>

<h3>Motherlode Blog: Letting Children Take Risks: When Does It Make You a Risky Parent?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>We were all minding our own business, looking at the screens of our mobile devices, until the local news on a television there aired a story that united a group of strangers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It turns out the staff members and customers of that repair shop had a fair amount in common: We'd all been children, we were all parents, and we were all horrified by the sanctioning of two fellow Maryland parents for the crime of letting their kids (10 and 6 years old) walk home alone from the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Danielle and Alexander Meitiv were found responsible for "unsubstantiated child neglect" after a two-month investigation by Montgomery County Child Protective Services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As far as the waiting room could tell, the finding means the Child Protective Services will keep a file on the family for many years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It also seems that the family could face repercussions if they do anything to catch Child Protective Services' attention, like letting their children walk unaccompanied again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Everyone in the waiting room started talking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>We told stories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The estimator said he couldn't have been more than 7 or 8 when he and an older friend rode their bikes all the way from suburban Maryland to the zoo in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It must have been nearly 10 miles each way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The rest of us nodded in understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Back in the 1970s and '80s, we'd disappear for hours as children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The front desk person said she used to climb trees and read for hours in the branches, unnoticed, content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>My friends and I went through a phase where we'd go around collecting neighborhood road kill, burying our dead squirrels and birds with solemn funerals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Someone raised the subject of our own children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I recalled how my son described a recent snowstorm as one of the best days of his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He and friends were outside for four hours; they jumped creeks, built forts, sledded, threw snowballs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It seemed as if everyone in the room had a snow story; we had a good time with those.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And then one of the men offered a different kind of story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He'd been a single parent raising his son, and he couldn't afford child care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>So from a pretty early age (the legal limit in Maryland) his boy got himself home from school, let himself in the apartment, and waited until his dad came home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He smiled then, at the memory of his boy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"He wasn't lonely, though, he was always outside, playing with his friends."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Then the guy shook his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"What would they do to me now if they saw him out there playing? Would they try to take him?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It's not an absurd question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A South Carolina mother was arrested last summer for leaving her child at a nearby park while she was at work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She also could not afford child care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>I don't mean to scapegoat child service workers, who were no doubt just following their rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But we need to recognize that well-intended laws aimed at protecting vulnerable children from real abuse and neglect can have unintended consequences, and one of those consequences is that parents will believe that letting kids be kids - the kinds of kids they themselves often were - will put their family in danger, even if the children themselves are at statistically little risk of anything but poor choices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>(That stuff still gets back to parents via phone calls, texts and informative neighborhood list-serves - the latter, in fact, is how I heard that some of the snowball throwing that was part of my son's excellent day was not appreciated by all our neighborhood drivers. The children won't do that again.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>My new waiting room acquaintances and I agreed that parents should be able to send their children to the park to play without fear from the authorities, just as our parents used to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>To us children of the 1970s and '80s, it's feeling a little personal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It's starting to seem as if someone's saying the way we were raised is no longer O.K. And speaking for a lot of us, we disagree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>We liked our way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>I've been sensing a healthy backlash against the kind of helicopter parenting that smothers a child and doesn't let him or her grow, learn from their mistakes, even figure out how to be bored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Unfortunately, while more and more parents seem to want to just say no to excessive hand-holding, that's clearly not the case with all our bureaucracies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>As one fellow parent noted, looking wistfully out the repair shop window at the snow-covered landscape, "It's almost like they'd rather our kids sit in the basement and play video games for hours than wander outside."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Here in Maryland, it does kind of feel like that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>And it feels wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>We're all living the family dynamic, as parents, as children, as siblings, uncles and aunts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>At Motherlode, lead writer and editor KJ Dell'Antonia invites contributors and commenters to explore how our families affect our lives, and how the news affects our families-and all families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Are your family's rules about children's mobile phone use set "rules," or just general guidelines?</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Welcome to Motherlode's weekly open thread.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Do you have thoughts about the news this week, and how it affects families?</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>A question to ask?</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>A rant to share?</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>This is your place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Teenagers need to become the centers of their own stories.</td></tr>
