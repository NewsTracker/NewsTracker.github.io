<h3>With business activity at near 4-year high, survey finds eurozone economy gaining momentum</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON - The 19-country eurozone economy appears to be gaining momentum as a closely-watched survey found business activity at a near four-year high in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In its monthly survey, financial information company Markit says its purchasing managers' index for the region rose to 54.1 points in March from 53.3 in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That puts the index at its highest level since May 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Anything above 50 indicates expansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Markit says the upturn was largely fueled by new orders and that the improvement was broad-based across sectors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The survey found Germany, the currency bloc's biggest economy, doing particularly well and France improving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, says Tuesday that the European Central Bank's recently launched monetary stimulus has started "at a time when the eurozone's economic upturn is already starting to gain traction."</td></tr>
