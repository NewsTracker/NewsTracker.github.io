<h3>Russia 'ramping up Ukraine presence'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The US has accused Russia of deploying more air defence systems in eastern Ukraine in breach of a ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The state department also said Russia was involved in training separatist forces in the area and building up its forces along the border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Kremlin has not yet responded to the claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A truce between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels in east Ukraine was brokered by the West in Minsk in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukraine accuses Russia of arming the rebels and sending Russian troops over the border - a claim Moscow denies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>State department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement that "combined Russian-separatist forces" were violating the terms of the Minsk deal, keeping artillery and multiple rocket launchers in prohibited areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The Russian military has deployed additional air defence systems into eastern Ukraine and moved several of these nearer the front lines," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This is the highest amount of Russian air defence equipment in eastern Ukraine since August."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ms Harf said the "increasingly complex nature" of training of pro-Russian forces in east Ukraine "leaves no doubt that Russia is involved".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Russia is also building up its forces along its border with Ukraine," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"After maintaining a relatively steady presence along the border, Russia is sending additional units there. These forces will give Russia its largest presence on the border since October 2014."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Earlier this month, about 300 US paratroopers arrived in western Ukraine to train with Ukrainian national guard units.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At the time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned the move "could seriously destabilise" the situation in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>One of the key points of the Minsk deal stipulates that all foreign armed groups, weapons and mercenaries should withdraw from Ukrainian territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The UN says at least 6,116 people have been killed since the fighting began in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions last April - a month after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Despite the ceasefire deal, sporadic exchanges of fire have taken place.</td></tr>
