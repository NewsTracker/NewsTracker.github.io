<h3>Penn State frat suspended over alleged nude Facebook pictures</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The suspension of Kappa Delta Rho (KDR) fraternity comes as State College Police as well as university officials investigate the fraternity's alleged use of the online page with up to 144 active members, including current and former students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"No arrests are being made at this time," State College Police Lt. Keith Robb said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Unfortunately, we aren't able to identify any suspects right now because the accounts on Facebook were sanitized, wiped clean."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Robb said it has not yet been determined if any crime occurred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a statement, college administrators said the fraternity's local chapter had been suspended for one year by the Penn State Interfraternity Council and that police and university officials were investigating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The statement said the fraternity used the private Facebook page to post "highly inappropriate photographs ... of activities and events that are in direct violation of the standards and values of a recognized student organization at Penn State."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The images allegedly included nude and partially nude women -- some seemed to pose, others appeared incapacitated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent with the University community's values and expectations," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Penn State University President Eric Barron said in a separate statement Wednesday that the university will work with Kappa Delta Rho's national headquarters to determine whether the fraternity should be reinstated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The university is also considering whether fraternities will continue at Penn State, Barron said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It ... brings us to a point where we must ask if a re-evaluation of the fraternity system is required," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Some members of the University senior leadership believe it is, and we are considering our options."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>David Clohessy, director of the St. Louis-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said in a statement that the latest allegations call into question the university's handling of sex crime reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"For years now, Penn State enthusiasts have repeatedly reassured everyone who'd listen that the university's problematic culture about sex crimes had been 'reformed," Clohessy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The latest allegations -- that fraternity members posted nude pictures of women on Facebook, some of whom appeared to be sleeping or passed out -- raise serious doubts about those claims."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In 2012, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of sexually molesting boys and sentenced to a 30- to 60-year prison term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, is appealing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The Kappa Delta Rho is a wake-up call," Clohessy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"But the Sandusky case should have been a wake-up call too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A former member of Kappa Delta Rho alerted police to the page, telling them in January that it had been used by members to share photos of "unsuspecting victims, drug sales and hazing," according to a copy of a police affidavit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The drugs allegedly included "marijuana and edibles, concentrates, ADD medication, and some cocaine," the affidavit said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The former frat member who tipped off police told authorities that a second Facebook page called "2.0" allegedly had been created around April 2014 following complaints from a woman whose photo was posted on it, the affidavit said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The earlier version of the page was titled "Covert Business Transactions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Rape, nude photos, racist behavior: Do fraternities make men behave badly?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The ex-frat member told police that the victim was visiting the fraternity when she saw a topless photo of herself after a member accidentally left his Facebook page logged in, the affidavit said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The affidavit included photos of women and screen shots of cellphone text exchanges, including one from a woman who allegedly had no recollection of a sexual encounter and whether birth control was used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In the Sandusky case, the sensational trial featured the testimony of eight young men who said they were sexually abused by Sandusky -- either groped in a car, soaped by him in the shower or sexually assaulted on a basement waterbed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The scandal gripped the nation and ended a torturous chapter for the victims and Penn State's vaunted football program, including the dismissal of the late legendary coach Joe Paterno and one of America's highest-paid university presidents, Graham Spanier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It also tarnished Penn State's celebrated reputation in collegiate athletics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We hope that Penn State officials will stop patting themselves on the back and start instituting real reforms to make the campus safer for students," said Clohessy, whose group includes members who were allegedly molested by religious figures of all denominations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Attempts to reach the university and interfraternity council were unsuccessful.</td></tr>

<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu walks back his opposition to a Palestinian state</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jerusalem: Days after winning Israel's election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be backtracking from hard-line statements that ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hours before the election, with polls showing he could lose, Mr Netanyahu declared that the Palestinians would never have a state on his watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict prior to his re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was a sweeping statement that flew in the face of his own past commitments and 25 years of international efforts to arrive at a two-state solution to the conflict: Israel and an independent Palestine living side-by-side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The US suggested the newly declared opposition to a Palestinian state could jeopardise America's unwavering support for Israel at the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The US would "re-evaluate our approach" based on Mr Netanyahu's "change in his position", White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Now Mr Netanyahu has said in a TV interview that he remains committed to Palestinian statehood - if conditions in the region improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I don't want a one-state solution. I want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution. But for that circumstances have to change," he told MSNBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The question is whether Netanyahu - who shifted sharply to the right in the last days of his campaign, using messages such as his "no-state" pledge to successfully draw right-wing votes away from ultranationalist parties - really meant what he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And if so, what it means for the Palestinians, relations with Israel and the future of the peace process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One of Netanyahu's closest confidants, Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon, said on BBC radio the very idea of two states was unworkable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Can you imagine a viable Palestinian entity, economic-wise? What about infrastructure, electricity, water?" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"They are connected to us like a Siamese twin, so the whole idea of full separation is not viable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Around Netanyahu and on the right-wing of Israeli politics - including party leaders likely to be in his next government - it is common to hear that the two-state solution is dead, with no way of reconciling Israel's security demands with Palestinian independence and no willingness on Israel's part to share Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek as a capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Instead, right-wing leaders like Naftali Bennett, the head of the pro-settler Jewish Home party and a candidate for a top post in the next government, advocate Israel's annexation of most of the West Bank, while granting the Palestinians "enhanced autonomy" within the remaining 40 per cent of the territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even under a two-state scenario, Israel talks about retaining major settlement blocs and control of the Jordan Valley, where the West Bank borders Jordan, leaving a patchwork behind, although land swaps with Israel would provide some compensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The idea of dividing Jerusalem is dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The impression that emerges is that Israeli leaders on the right would ultimately prefer a model in which the Palestinians have a high degree of self-rule but Israel's military retains control in a form of "benign occupation" of the West Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There is no active discussion along those lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Instead, Netanyahu's dismissal of two states will encourage the Palestinians to again seek recognition via the United Nations as well as bilaterally - 135 of 193 UN members already recognise the State of Palestine, including several EU member states, even if the EU itself does not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We will not backtrack from our position in demanding that international legitimacy be achieved," Abbas said on Thursday, adding that Netanyahu's words were worrying but not new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The shift may come from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In the past, including last December, Washington has stood in the way of Palestinian efforts to get a UN resolution recognising its statehood, including threatening to use its veto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But a US official said it was possible the Obama administration would now allow a Security Council resolution on a two-state solution to proceed by withholding its veto, a move that would alarm Netanyahu's government.</td></tr>
