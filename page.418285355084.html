<h3>Polls open in historic Greek bailout referendum</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Preparations are underway in Greece ahead of Sunday's referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As Europe waits for the outcome of the crucial vote, patience is wearing thin in Germany, the country's biggest creditor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Athens: Greeks have begun to cast their votes in the historic referendum that may determine the country's future in the euro zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Referendum campaign posters that reads "No" and "Yes" in Greek in Athens, Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The poll by the respected ALCO institute, published in the Ethnos newspaper on Friday, put the 'Yes' camp on 44.8 per cent against 43.4 per cent for the 'No' vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the lead was well within the pollster's 3.1 percentage point margin of error, with 11.8 per cent saying they are still undecided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Polls opened at 7 am local time and close at 7 pm (2 am Australian eastern time), with the first official projection of the result expected at 9 pm local time (4 am Australian eastern time).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Given a volatile public mood and a string of recent election results that ran counter to opinion poll predictions, the result is in effect completely open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Supporters of Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, at a "No" rally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With banks shuttered all week, cash withdrawals rationed and commerce seizing up, the vote could decide whether Greece gets another last-ditch financial rescue in exchange for more harsh austerity measures or plunges deeper into economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It could also determine whether Greece becomes the first country to crash out of the 19-nation European single currency area, membership of which is meant to be irrevocable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The survey found that 74 per cent of Greeks want to stay in the euro, while just 15 per cent want to return to a national currency, with 11 per cent undecided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras campaigning for a 'no' vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has urged Greeks to reject the "humiliating" terms offered last week by international creditors in a deal that is no longer on the table, and accused lenders of "blackmail" by withholding credit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As discontent has mounted over long queues for pensions and at cash machines, Mr Tsipras promised voters banks would reopen as soon as the government clinched a fresh loan from its euro zone partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Credit ratings agency Fitch said the banks were already effectively bust and would go to the wall within days unless the European Central Bank increases emergency liquidity assistance to help them cope with a wave of withdrawals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>An European Union flag flutters near the Parthenon in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday that Greece faces a huge financial hole regardless of the outcome of the referendum and would need some 50 billion euros as well as a massive debt writedown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Greece's European partners, alarmed that a Greek exit would change the nature of a 15-year-old currency union intended to be unbreakable, have made it clear they regard the vote as a choice of whether Greeks want to stay in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Greeks have been bombarded with dire warnings of what a 'No' vote could mean for their future in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But as the deadline approached, the overall tone appeared cooler as if in recognition of the fact that after five years of bailout-imposed austerity, even those Greeks who intend to vote 'Yes' have little appetite for yet more advice from abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If voters back a bailout plan the government has scorned, Mr Tsipras and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis have said they would quit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That would lead to a scramble to either try to put together a national unity government to negotiate a loan deal or call new elections by September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In an interview published on Saturday the outspoken Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis accused Athens's creditors of "terrorism".</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"What they're doing with Greece has a name - terrorism," he told the Spanish El Mundo daily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"What Brussels and the troika want today is for the 'Yes' (vote) to win so they could humiliate the Greeks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>As tensions rose Mr Varoufakis was forced to deny a Financial Times report that suggested Greek savers could lose 30 per cent of their bank deposits to shore up the banking system, slamming it a "malicious rumour".</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The British business daily, quoting unidentified bankers and businessmen close to negotiations, reported that Greek depositors with more than 8000 euros ($A11,611) in an account may be force to take a "haircut".</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Rumours that capital controls imposed by the government were leading to food and medicine shortages were spooking Greeks, as was growing uncertainty over when the country's banks would re-open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I've heard shops are running out of flour, sugar and salt. I'm really worried, how will we manage if we can't get to our money and there's no food to buy?" said Lena Antoniou, a 35-year old mother of two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Greeks are hoarding cash and food amid mounting fears the economy could collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Supermarket shelves have been stripped bare in places as residents stock up on bags of food, with essentials such as sugar, flour and pasta top of the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A referendum on whether to accept a bailout deal could seal the country's financial fate and many fear the worst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>EU leaders have warned that a "No" victory could cause Greece to crash out of the eurozone, but Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has accused them of fear-mongering.</td></tr>
