<h3>CIA plans major reorganisation and a focus on digital espionage</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CIA Director John Brennan has outlined a plan for the reorganisation of the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Washington: The CIA is set to embark on a sweeping restructure that will bring an end to divisions that have been in place for decades, create 10 new centres that team analysts with operators, and significantly expand the agency's focus on digital espionage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The plans were unveiled by CIA director John Brennan to a workforce in which thousands of employees are likely to see changes in which departments they work for, the lines of authority they report to and even where they sit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The overhaul is designed to foster deeper collaboration and an intensified focus on a range of security issues and threats, replacing long-standing divisions that cover the Middle East, Africa and other regions with hybrid "mission centres" modelled on the CIA's Counterterrorism Centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The CIA will also create a new directorate focused exclusively on exploiting advances in computer technology and communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Directorate of Digital Innovation will rank alongside the agency's operations and analysis branches, and be responsible for missions ranging from cyber-espionage to the security of the CIA's internal email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Brennan described the far-reaching changes as "part of the natural evolution of an intelligence agency" that has not seen a significant reorganisation in decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A central aim, he said, is to eliminate "seams" in coverage that lead to confusion over which part of the agency is responsible for tracking a specific issue or threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After the reorganisation, Mr Brennan said, the CIA should be in position to "cover the entire universe, regionally and functionally, and so something that's going on in the world falls into one of those buckets".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The changes, however, are also likely to create turmoil at a time that Mr Brennan and others frequently characterise as the most complicated and challenging period for intelligence agencies in a generation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Brennan said the plan has been received enthusiastically by most at the agency, but there have also been signs of friction and disagreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The head of the CIA's clandestine service recently decided to retire abruptly in part because of opposition to a plan that would strip his position of much of its authority over the agency's covert operations overseas and the teams of spies that it deploys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>CIA veterans and experts described the restructuring as among the most ambitious since the agency was founded in 1947.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This is a major reorganisation, one of the largest and most fundamental they've had," said Mark Lowenthal, a former senior CIA officer and an expert on the history of the US intelligence community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Lowenthal also expressed concern that replicating the Counterterrorism Centre may also mean replicating an approach criticised at times for being too driven by short-term objectives such as finding the next target for a drone strike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Mr Brennan defended the reforms as critical to the agency's viability in an era of technological and social upheaval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Brennan's plan was endorsed by others in the Obama administration who noted the advantages of allowing operators and analysts to collaborate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As part of Mr Brennan's plan, long-standing divisions focused on Africa, the Middle East and other regions will give way to centres of corresponding geographic boundaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The directorates of intelligence and operations - as the analysis and spying branches are known - will continue to exist, but function mainly as talent pools: recruiting and training personnel that can be deployed to the new centres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Some who grew up in the old structure will have heartburn with this, but those costs will be short-term," said Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Morell said existing centres have "proven to be a very powerful combination" and that the Counterterrorism Centre is "the most successful agency component over the last decade".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Directorate of Digital Innovation will perform a similar role, and absorb existing entities including the Open Source Centre, which monitors Twitter and other social media sites for intelligence on such adversaries as the Islamic State, as well as the Information Operations Centre, a secret organisation that handles missions including cyber-penetrations and sabotage and is now the second-largest centre at the CIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Mr Brennan made clear that the digital directorate will have a much broader mandate, responsible not only for devising new ways to steal secrets from cellphones and other devices but also helping CIA officers evade detection overseas in an age when their phones, computers and ATM cards leave digital trails.</td></tr>
