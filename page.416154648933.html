<h3>Review: Many choices, indecision with Apple Watch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Of the 13 Apple Watch models I tried over two sessions, the one I liked most cost $15,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Both sessions at the Apple store began with indecision: What size do I want?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Which band do I prefer?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I didn't have good answers as my Apple Watch try-on visits started - at first modestly, with models that cost about the same as an iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The try-on session typically begins with making an appointment online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If you're looking for a luxury "Edition" made of 18-karat gold alloy, you specify that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Only some stores offer those, including the one I visited on New York's Upper West Side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I bypassed the appointments because Apple's media reps in Cupertino, California, had arranged my sessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Stores will try to accommodate walk-ins, but appointments are encouraged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As someone who can't decide what to eat for lunch, I expected to be told which watch I wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sensing my indecision, the employees in both cases picked one just to get started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I began with a smaller version of the stainless steel case, with a brown leather band called Modern Buckle ($749).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The band looks like a leather strap you buckle, but has magnetic clasps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It felt loose, even at the tightest setting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I was told not every band is going to fit every wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I then tried a large stainless steel case with a black leather loop ($699) - also clasped magnetically, but without the holes you normally see with a buckle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The band comes in two sizes, but only the large one was available for trying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It was too long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It turns out stores don't have all 54 configurations available for trying out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Most stations have 18 watches to choose from, locked in a drawer that requires a tap from the employee's security device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>You get a feel, but not necessarily in your color or length.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>I tried the Modern Buckle again, this time in black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Still loose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>That was followed by large and small cases with a classic buckle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The fit was much better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>I also tried models with a synthetic-rubber sports band and a stainless steel link bracelet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Bands are easily interchangeable by pressing a release button, and some are sold separately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>I can use the sports band for running and a classic buckle for regular wear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Likewise, individual links on the bracelet can be removed without special tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But the try-on visits aren't set up for that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Nor are they set up for lefties; everything will appear upside down in the watches' demonstration mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>You can change that - once you buy it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I returned several hours later to meet with an Edition specialist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>I wasn't feted with chocolate and champagne, but I did get a more personalized experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>You're taken to a private room in some stores, but mine didn't have one, so luxury appointments are done on the main floor, to the side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>As the specialist assisted me, another employee went into a backroom to bring out specific models on request - in nice boxes that give the watch a luxury feel, while doubling as a charger (there's a charging port in the back).</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The process wasn't as quick as I expected, but what's the rush when you're ready to spend $10,000 to $17,000?</td></tr>
