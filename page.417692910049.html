<h3>Colo. theater shooter's ex: 'I didn't see a future with him' - VIDEO: Holmes' ex-girlfriend testifies at trial - WATCH LIVE: Witness testimony continues</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Their first date was a horror film festival and they grew closer after that, sharing nights together at home watching movies or playing board games with friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But a former girlfriend of Colorado theater shooter James Holmes didn't want anything more than a casual relationship, she testified in his death penalty trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She broke it off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I told him that I didn't see a future with him," Gargi Datta said Wednesday in her first public comments since the July 2012 shooting at a suburban Denver movie theater that left 12 dead and 70 injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Datta will continue testifying Thursday about the messages and emails Holmes sent her in the months that they dated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prosecutors have said Holmes sent her messages saying he wanted to kill people, but she didn't take him seriously and suggested he see a therapist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Their breakup in February 2012 was a catalyst to the shooting five months later, District Attorney George Brauchler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said she was Holmes' first romantic relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In brief questioning before court adjourned Wednesday, Datta said she met Holmes in 2011 at the graduate school they attended outside Denver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She described him as a bright but shy neuroscience graduate student at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He wouldn't go up and interact with people," Datta said, adding that Holmes was more talkative when he was alone with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They started spending time together after she invited him to a study session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Datta said they were spending one or two nights a week together in the months before the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After they broke up, Holmes never revealed to her that he was amassing an arsenal of weapons and body armor in meticulous preparation for the attack, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Prosecutors contend Holmes was sane and are seeking the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In court, Datta never looked directly at Holmes and repeatedly referred to him as "the defendant" rather than his name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Holmes swayed in his chair as she spoke but had no other visible reaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In a video played earlier in the trial, Holmes said he fell in love with Datta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He had written about her in emails to his parents, saying he had cooked dinner for her on Valentine's Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The two played board games together with friends, watched movies at home, shared dinners and were in the same stressful classes, Datta said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But Datta said she wanted to end the relationship in January 2012 when she returned from winter break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I had already told him in the start that it was a casual relationship," she testified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I didn't feel I was getting closer to him. I think he liked me more than I liked him."</td></tr>
