<h3>Fighting rages in run-up to Ukraine ceasefire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A ceasefire is due to come into effect from Sunday under the agreement, which also envisages a withdrawal of the heavy weapons responsible for many of the 5,000 casualties in the conflict that broke out almost a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kiev said pro-Russian rebels had built up their forces across separatist-held zones since the deal and both sides accused each other of killing civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two people were killed and six wounded when a shell hit a cafe in the Kiev-controlled town of Shchastya near rebel-held Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, a local official said, adding other shells had struck elsewhere in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The town's heating system is broken, power lines are damaged as well as the water supply ... So this is how a comprehensive ceasefire is prepared for," the head of the Kiev-controlled administration, Hennadiy Moskal, said online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The rebels accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the separatist stronghold of Donetsk and the town of Horlivka, where they said on their website that three children had been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The sound of artillery could be heard in the outskirts of Donetsk and clouds of black smoke hung over its suburbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pro-Russian rebel forces practice near Debaltseve, eastern Ukraine, Friday, March 13, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Outgoing fire from the Ukrainian side was visible on the road between Kiev-controlled Kramatorsk and rebel-held Donetsk and rebels at a checkpoint near Donetsk said they had been hit by mortar strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They mocked the impending truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"What sort of ceasefire? Don't make me laugh. This is already the second or third ceasefire," one said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Group of Seven industrialised countries issued a statement late on Friday calling on all sides to refrain from actions in the coming days that would hinder the start of the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It said G7 countries were ready to take "appropriate measures" against those who violate the agreement, an apparent threat of more economic sanctions against Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The deal, sealed by the leaders of Germany and France after 16 hours of all-night talks in Minsk, capital of Belarus, with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, was soon overshadowed by the clashes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A Ukrainian military spokesman said 11 soldiers had been killed and 40 wounded in the past 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The enemy continues to build up forces in the main areas of the armed conflict," Andriy Lysenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Fighting was intense around Debaltseve, a railway junction linking the two main rebel areas, where separatists used rockets and artillery to attack government forces holding the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Rebels are repeatedly storming the strongholds and base camp of Ukrainian forces," in and around Debaltseve as well as firing artillery, mortars and rockets, Lysenko said, stressing that government troops had held their positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The United States and Europe have threatened further sanctions against Moscow if the rebels seize more territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ukraine's pro-Western president said he was not naive and wanted to make clear the country was a long way from peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Nobody has a strong belief that the peace conditions which were signed in Minsk will be implemented strictly," Petro Poroshenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Away from the battlefield, disagreements surfaced over whether a rebel amnesty or the release of a Ukrainian pilot detained by Russia were part of the ceasefire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Western diplomats said the European Union would go ahead on Monday with planned sanctions against 19 Ukrainian separatists and Russians, despite the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>NATO and the United States said the fighting ran counter to the spirit, if not the letter of the agreement and U.S. officials said further sanctions were still on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>At an EU summit in Brussels, the leaders of Germany, France and the European Council also said new sanctions were possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The French, German, Russian and Ukrainian leaders are expected to speak again by phone on Saturday in the hours before the ceasefire is due to take effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow expected all points of the deal to be implemented, but that Russia had not promised to free Nadezhda Savchenko, a detained Ukrainian pilot that Kiev wants free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Her case would be decided by a Russian court, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Ukraine said it had not agreed to an amnesty for all rebels, drawing an angry response from the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sanctions by the EU and United States have piled intense economic pressure on Russia's economy, which has also been hit by a collapse in oil prices.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the agreement with Russia on Ukraine as a good start but said undertakings must now be respected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Ukraine reported a new, mass influx of Russian armour into rebel-held eastern Ukraine as the agreement was being finalised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The deal calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line when and if the ceasefire has taken hold, and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The rebels have advanced far past an earlier ceasefire deal, agreed in September, and the new agreement appears to envisage them pulling their guns back around 75 km, to take them back behind it, while Ukrainian guns would move 25 km back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>This would leave a buffer zone 50 km wide, a challenge for the monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who are expected to patrol it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It also appears to take more territory outside Kiev's control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The White House, under pressure from Congress to provide arms to the stretched Ukrainian military, said the deal was "potentially significant" but urged Russia to withdraw soldiers and equipment, and give Ukraine back control over its border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Russia denies arming the rebels and sending troops to fight alongside them, despite what Ukraine and its Western allies say is overwhelming evidence.</td></tr>

<h3>Steep decline in language learning</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The statistics are likely to spark fresh concerns about the future of language study, amid indications that some university departments are being forced to cut back or close down due to a lack of demand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A breakdown of the statistics, published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) shows particular drops in some traditionally popular modern languages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In 2013/14, there were just 615 entrants for German degree courses, down 34% on 2007/08, while French entrants have dropped by a quarter, to 1,775 starting courses in 2013/14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Spanish has seen a 1% drop in this seven year period, while Italian entries fell 19%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chinese studies bucked the trend, with a 30% increase in entries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There are also signs that fewer students are likely to be studying languages at degree level in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last summer's A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed another slump in entries for the subject, with the numbers taking French down from 11,272 in 2013 to 10,433 - a drop of 7.4% - while German has declined 4,242 to 4,187, representing a 1.2% fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There has been a steady decline in the number of pupils taking languages at GCSE, a fall that began soon after the last government abolished the requirement for teenagers to study a language to GCSE in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The coalition Government has brought in a new requirement for seven to 11-year-olds in England to be taught a language in primary schools and introduced the English Baccalaureate, which recognises students who gain at least a C at GCSE in English, maths, science, history or geography and a foreign language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Figures from 2013 had indicated that the slump in entries at GCSE was starting to slow, with a rise in the numbers of teenagers taking languages such as French, German and Spanish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But last summer's GCSE results showed that Spanish was the only one of three traditional languages to see a rise in entries, a move that some put down to the "Messi impact" of high-profile Spanish-speaking personalities like football star Lionel Messi fuelling youngsters interest in the subject.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Vicky Gough, schools adviser at the British Council, said: "These latest figures are another blow for language lovers in the UK. It is particularly disappointing to see that even Spanish, a language that has generally bucked the trend in declining language take up at GCSE and A-level, has also seen an overall drop albeit at a less dramatic rate than French and German. The unfortunate reality is that language learning at university level is in decline with little to suggest that this is set to change any time soon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Languages are "imperative" for the UK's future prosperity, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"If we are to compete in a global economy, we need more of our young people to be able to understand and embrace other languages in order to live and work in a globalised society, as well as to become the language teachers of the future. An international outlook has never been more important for the UK's place in the world - this starts with language learning."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>While there has been a stark fall in university language entries, the statistics show a growing demand for biology, maths and business degrees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Entries for all biological science degrees are up 30%, while entries from business and administration courses, such as business studies, management, finance, accounting and marketing have risen by 24%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Maths related courses are up 24%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: "All university disciplines, including languages, STEM and the arts, are essential to the UK in terms of their contribution to economic growth as well as their social and cultural contributions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The evidence of a fall in the number of students taking up language courses at UK universities is of real concern. Much of this fall is linked to demand from school leavers. If students are not studying relevant subjects in secondary education, they are unlikely to choose to follow these subjects into higher education.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Employers tell us that they are increasingly on the lookout for graduates with experience of other countries and knowledge of another language. These skills are essential in doing business and engaging effectively with other countries."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A Government spokesman said: " We are committed to promoting the study of languages and have provided specific funding to higher education institutes to support the continued availability of language courses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We are making it compulsory for children to learn a foreign language from age seven to 14 and our English Baccalaureate means thousands more pupils are now studying languages at secondary school. Since 2010 we have already seen the number of pupils taking languages at GCSE-level rising by 21%."</td></tr>
