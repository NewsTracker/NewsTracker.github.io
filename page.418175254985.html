<tr><td>9</td><td>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) - Liberian authorities on Tuesday quarantined two households after the corpse of a 17-year-old boy was found with Ebola, sparking fears the West African country could face another outbreak of the disease nearly two months after being declared Ebola-free.</td></tr>
