<h3>Violence flares in Baltimore after funeral of Freddy Gray</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The attorney for the family of Freddie Gray is calling on the community to end their focus on violence in the wake of Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Baltimore: Hundreds of young people faced off with police in Baltimore on Monday after the funeral of a black city man who died in police custody, and local law enforcement officials warned of a threat by gangs against officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Youths stoned a city bus and passing police vehicles outside the Mondawmin Mall in northwest Baltimore just a few blocks from the site of the funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>From a helicopter, police called for them to disperse, but the youths ignored the order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earlier, thousands of mourners crowded into the New Shiloh Baptist Church to bid an emotional goodbye to Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old who died from a spinal cord injury while in police custody, and to demand reforms in law enforcement and far beyond it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A mourner stands in front of the open casket of 25-year old Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Friends, neighbours, activists and government officials from the local level to the White House filled the church and filed past the open, white coffin bearing the body of Gray, whose death on April 19 fed claims of discriminatory and brutal policing and set off a week of protests here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The church, with seating for 2200, was overflowing for the funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Reverend Jamal Bryant, delivering the eulogy, spoke of the plight of poor, young black men like Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He had to have been asking himself: 'What am I going to do with my life?'" Reverend Bryant said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He had to feel at age 25 like the walls were closing in on him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Demonstrators throw rocks to the police, after the funeral of Freddie Gray at New Shiloh Baptist Church in Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Even as mourners searched for seats in the church, the Baltimore Police Department announced what it called a credible threat that street gangs "have entered into a partnership to 'take out' law enforcement officers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But inside the church, the focus was on how the police and government must change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"When society is sick and mean, the innocent will be slain," the Reverend Jesse Jackson told the congregation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He noted the contrast between Baltimore's poor, overwhelmingly black west side, and the city's bustling, prosperous downtown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Sixteen thousand abandoned or vacant homes, 25 per cent unemployment - we don't need more police; we need more jobs," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Why can't the west side get the same things downtown gets?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Congressman Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland who was one of the speakers, were seated in the pews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>As Ms Rawlings-Blake issued a "call for peace," the Baltimore police said Sunday that 35 people had been arrested and that six officers had suffered minor injuries on Saturday night as demonstrators smashed a storefront window, threw rocks and bottles, and scuffled with officers in riot gear outside Camden Yards, the Orioles' baseball stadium.</td></tr>
