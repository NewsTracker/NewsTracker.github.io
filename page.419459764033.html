<h3>Mexico finds 'main' skull rack at Aztec temple complex</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexican archaeologists believe they have found the main trophy rack of sacrificed human skulls at Mexico City's Templo Mayor Aztec ruin site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Racks known as "tzompantli" were where Aztecs displayed the severed heads of sacrificial victims on wooden poles pushed through the sides of the skull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But archaeologists at Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History said Thursday that this one was different.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Part of the platform where the heads were displayed was made of rows of skulls mortared together roughly in a circle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>All the skulls were arranged to look inward toward the center of the circle, but experts don't know what was at the center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The find was made between February and June under the floor of a colonial-era house in downtown Mexico City.</td></tr>
