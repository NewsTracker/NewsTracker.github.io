<h3>Nigeria recaptures Boko Haram 'HQ' Gwoza</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ABUJA: Nigeria's military on Friday announced that troops had retaken the town of Gwoza from Boko Haram, from which the group declared their caliphate last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Troops this morning captured Gwoza destroying the headquarters of the Terrorists self-styled Caliphate," Defence Headquarters in Abuja said on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Several terrorists died while many are captured. Mopping up of entire Gwoza and her suburbs is ongoing," it added in a separate message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier this month, residents who fled the town in Borno state told AFP that militants had been massing in Gwoza and killing local people who were unable to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That led to speculation that the group, which has been pushed out of a number of towns in three northeast states in recent weeks, was preparing for a final assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared on August 24 last year that Gwoza was "part of the Islamic caliphate", adding to speculation the militants were imitating the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
