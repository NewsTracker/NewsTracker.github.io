<h3>Greece races against clock to submit reform proposal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece submitted a request for aid from Europe's bailout fund Wednesday, and is rushing to detail a plan of economic reforms that creditors want to see this week if they are to save the country from financial collapse and keep it in Europe's joint currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras earned both cheers and jeers as he addressed lawmakers at the European Parliament, where he said his country is seeking a deal that might bring a definitive end to his country's financial crisis, not just a temporary stop-gap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We need to ensure the medium-term funding of our country with a development and growth program," Tsipras told the lawmakers gathered in Strasbourg, France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece on Wednesday morning submitted a written request for a new support program from Europe's bailout fund, according to Michel Reijns, the spokesman for the eurozone's top official, Jeroen Dijsselbloem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece needs to back that up by presenting by the end of Thursday a detailed, cost-assessed plan on the economic measures it would take in exchange for loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>So far, Greece has only produced an outline of the measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>European leaders will hold a summit on Sunday to decide whether the plan is good enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Applause rose from leftist quarters in the EU Parliament when Tsipras said aid to Greece only helped out banks, not ordinary Greeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A few called for compromise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The head of a conservative group in the Parliament, Belgium's Guy Verhofstadt, said he was "furious" at Tsipras' failure to spell out specifics of his reform plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The leader of Britain's nationalist UKIP, Nigel Farage, told Tsipras: "Your country ... should have never joined the euro" and urged him to quit the common currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Britain is not part of the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tsipras insisted last Sunday's referendum result, in which voters soundly rejected a previous creditors' reform proposal, does not mean a break with Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In Greece, meanwhile, people were struggling with an eighth day of limits on money withdrawals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They cannot take out more than 60 euros ($67) a day from TMS, are unable to send money abroad or pay supplies or bills without special permission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The banks remain shut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He described Greece as having been used as an "austerity experiment" for the last five years of bailout reforms imposed on the country that led to spiraling unemployment and poverty, and a contraction of the economy by a quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We demand an agreement with our neighbors, but one that gives us a sign that we are on a long-lasting basis exiting from the crisis - which will demonstrate to us that there is light at the end of the tunnel. An agreement which will bring about the credible and necessary reforms," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tsipras vowed to continue reforms already undertaken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"But let us not forget that in the last five years, the Greek people have made a tremendous effort for adjustment - a very difficult and hard process of adjustment. This has exhausted the patience and resilience of the Greek people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Greek crisis has frayed the nerves of other European leaders, who have accused the Greek government, elected in January on promises to repeal austerity, of foot-dragging and exacerbating the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Highlighting the rising anger with Tsipras, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had a stark warning for Greece after Tuesday's eurozone summit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We have a Grexit scenario, prepared in detail," he said, apparently referring to the situation in which Greece would be forced out of the currency union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Greece's eurozone partners have steadfastly said they want to help Greece stay in the currency club but have just as often complained about Greece dragging its feet during months of negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>One big sticking point in the talks is Greece's demand that the terms of its bailout loans be made easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>European officials are split on the issue, with lead eurozone lender Germany still reluctant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The International Monetary Fund called last week for European states to accept longer repayment periods and lower interest rates on their loans to Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Many economists say that Greece's debt burden, at almost 180 percent of annual GDP, is unsustainable for a country its size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Greece has been granted two bailout programs worth a total of 240 billion euros ($266 billion) in loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But the spending cuts and tax increases demanded as a condition for the loans have hit growth, sending the country into a six-year recession and pushing unemployment to 25 percent.</td></tr>
