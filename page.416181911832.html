<h3>Israel's Netanyahu says sanctions should remain on Iran</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu has harshly criticized the U.S.-led framework deal with Iran, which offers relief from sanctions in exchange for scaling back its suspect nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu said Sunday that a better deal would tie the lifting of all sanctions, "to an end of Iran's aggression in the region, its worldwide terrorism and its threats to annihilate Israel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Iran demands that all sanctions be lifted on the day the agreement goes into effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Iran backs regional militant groups that fight Israel, including Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah, as well as forces fighting in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.</td></tr>
