<h3>Former ?Time? honcho heads to Yahoo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>yahoo!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Former Time Inc. Editor-in-Chief Martha Nelson is the latest editorial talent to land at Yahoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She is the Web portal's senior vice president and global editor-in-chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nelson, in the newly formed position, will report to Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Media Kathy Savitt when she starts Aug. 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yahoo is flush with cash and is trying to establish its media division, which CEO Marissa Mayer only launched 19 months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It has since grown to 13 digital magazines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It has been expanding traffic, even as it fights against relentless downward pricing pressure on digital banner ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Although Nelson was known for launching InStyle and then running People, two of the most powerful print franchises at Time Inc., she said she also had digital experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I was very involved in relaunching People.com," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I didn't do it alone, but I hired good digital people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nelson rose through the ranks to become, in 2013, the first woman ever to be named editor-in-chief at Time Inc. But after holding the job for less than a year, she was informed that the company was restructuring and the editor-in-chief would no longer have all the company editors report to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Time Inc. CEO Joe Ripp decided to have editors report to business executives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nelson promptly resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Given her decades at Time Inc. and the wrenching changes it is undergoing, many think that she could serve as a magnet to attract editorial talent from her former stomping ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Talent is the key," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I don't have a shopping list. I am sure Yahoo is going to attract more talent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Filed under time inc. , yahoo!</td></tr>
