<h3>One Direction's Zayn Malik quits band</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The news was announced on One Direction's official website, with a statement from the band that read in part, "We're really sad to see Zayn go, but we totally respect his decision and send him all our love for the future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Malik issued his own statement saying, "My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart. I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Malik, who is engaged to Little Mix star Perrie Edwards, quit the One Direction tour last week due to stress just days after pictures emerged showing him partying with a young woman in Thailand.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Former American Idol judge Simon Cowell - who discovered the band - also weighed in on Malik's departure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I would like to say thank you to Zayn for everything he has done for One Direction. Since I first met Zayn in 2010, I have grown very, very fond - and immensely proud - of him. I have seen him grow in confidence and I am truly sorry to see him leave. As for One Direction, fans can rest assured that Niall, Liam, Harry and Louis are hugely excited about the future of the band."</td></tr>
