<h3>Americans evacuated after possible Ebola contact</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The World Health Organisation says its tally of Ebola deaths has passed 10,000, mostly in West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>New York: Several American aid workers, among at least 10 who might have come into contact with the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone, have been evacuated over the weekend, the most Americans who have returned home over fears of exposure to the virus since an outbreak in three West African countries was declared last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Another aid worker, who was showing signs of illness, arrived in the US on Friday evening, hours after a colleague with Ebola was flown from Sierra Leone to the clinical centre of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That patient, a clinician who was not identified, tested positive for the virus on Tuesday, and investigators feared that he had exposed others to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The workers served at an Ebola treatment unit run by the US charity Partners in Health in the Port Loko district in northern Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The American who arrived Friday evening had developed symptoms last week, but tested negative twice, said several officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She is being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has a specialised unit for Ebola patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The patient's entrance at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, now housing a US healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola while working in Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Because the 10 other aid workers are not showing symptoms, they will not be hospitalised, but will instead remain in isolation and be subject to monitoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Saturday that the Americans would be taken on three flights to be close to three hospitals capable of treating Ebola patients: the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the National Institutes of Health centre in Bethesda or Emory University Hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So far, none of the other 10 aid workers have developed symptoms, said the embassy spokeswoman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>An investigation is continuing, and more workers will be evacuated if necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, described the infected clinician's condition as serious on Friday evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Saturday, a spokeswoman for the National Institutes of Health said there had been no change to report.</td></tr>
