<tr><td>4</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Advocacy groups seeking to get the British Museum to return the Parthenon Marbles to Athens expressed disappointment Thursday after Greece's culture minister said he would not launch a court challenge for the famous collection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The sculptures, which for more than 2,000 years decorated the Parthenon temple on the Acropolis in Athens, were removed more than two centuries ago by Lord Elgin, a Scottish nobleman, and are on display at the London museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Culture Minister Nikos Xydakis on Wednesday said Athens would not seek court action against the museum but preferred a "diplomatic route."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dennis Menos of the International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures said the decision by the new government in Athens had "devastated the Greek position."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I'm sorry that this statement was made. (Court action) was always an option and now that has been eliminated," Menos told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The prospect of a legal challenge gained momentum last year when a team of London lawyers, including Amal Clooney, wife of the U.S. film star George Clooney, visited Athens and met officials from Greece's previous conservative government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Xydakis, the culture minister, said the legal initiative was funded by an anonymous private donor and was still ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he added, speaking to private Mega television: "It's a diplomatic route and a political one for (Greece). You cannot go to court for every issue. And in international court, the outcome is always uncertain. Things are not that simple."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Acropolis Museum, which opened at the foot of the ancient citadel in 2009, was built in part to house the Parthenon marbles if they are returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The site is the most visited museum in Greece, attracting nearly 1.4 million visitors in 2014.</td></tr>
