<h3>Drugs killed my brother but I dont want the Bali Nine pair to be executed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>'I know first-hand the pain and trauma that drug trafficking causes families,' Kaili Behan says in a statement posted to Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>'I have felt the powerlessness of trying to help someone get past grief and watching them slowly succumb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'Does that mean I don't stand for mercy towards Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>When she was just 19, Ms Behan lost her older brother Adam to a lethal cocktail of heroin and Oxycodone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Adam was autistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was his 22nd birthday party and someone gave him a heroin 'hot shot' which reacted with his medication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His heart failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'My brother was preyed upon by thoughtless d***heads who thought it would be funny to get the "retard" wasted,' Behan writes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In her open letter, Behan says she is telling her brother's story because she is 'tired of waking up with sadness reading the hatred and the blood-lust' towards Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She was tired of 'indignant' calls for the death penalty supposedly made on behalf of families who have lost loved ones to drugs, she told Daily Mail Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'You don't stand for me,' she writes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'To all of those baying for blood today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Although those responsible for her brother's death were never held to account, Behan says she found peace in compassion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'Those of us who have been through the loss of a son, brother, daughter, sister or other loved one through drugs seem to be the clearest and articulate voices for mercy towards Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran,' she writes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The pair have 'become the benchmark for what rehabilitation should like worldwide,' she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On Wednesday evening Ms Behan and her daughter Lily joined 200 people at the Perth Mercy vigil for the Bali Nine pair on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Her 'most compassionate' brother would have chosen to be there too, she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'I doubt I would have been so blessed had I stayed in a place of anger' says Kaili Behan pictured here with her children (from left) Lily-Bliss, Harley and Eden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>'Despite what happened to my brother and the terrible aftermath of it all - because I was able to be merciful and show forgiveness, even though the people who killed my brother were never brought to justice - I have since then lived an awesome life - and raised three compassionate and merciful (also feisty) children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>To all of those baying for blood today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To all of those saying that they would cheerfully partake in aiming a loaded gun at two men tethered to a post on a deserted beach, and shoot at them until their blood runs into the sand, and their hearts explode in their chests; making their final living minutes (yes death is not usually instant in a firing squad situation) excruciating - YOU DON'T SPEAK FOR ME.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>When you inarticulately spout your trash talk on social media like the gutless and grammatically challenged keyboard warriors that you are - YOU DON'T SPEAK FOR ME.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>When you repeatedly try and bludgeon the internet by peddling barbaric and offensive verbal diarrhoea, purporting to be a voice for those who have lost loved ones due to drugs - YOU DON'T SPEAK FOR ME.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>As it so happens, today, 17 February marks the 23rd anniversary of my beautiful and vulnerable autistic brother Adam's death - who died from a heroin overdose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In case you hounds of death are still reading, and not hovering viciously over your keyboard to give me your unfounded, uninformed opinion that he made his choice and somehow was 'to blame' for his death - ironic isn't how you people both blame the trafficker on behalf of 'the families', but still find space in your hardened hearts to blame the deceased person - I invite you to consider your position in light of my story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In case you are still reading, and your eyes have not clouded over with self-righteous indignation, this is the story of what happened to my big beautiful brother Adam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>This is also the story of how I learned that compassion is the only way forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This is the story of why I STAND FOR MERCY.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>My darling brother Adam was at a party ostensibly to celebrate turning 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In reality the 'party' was just another excuse for those who should have been caring for him to indulge their own vices and he was left alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>My darling brother was not a drug user, in fact he was so anti-drugs that he actually called Crime Stoppers when he found a joint in my backpack when I was 13!</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>My brother was preyed upon by thoughtless d***heads who thought it would be funny to get the 'retard' wasted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I am sure they never meant to kill him, however among other things, once he was vulnerable and could not defend himself after having been fed a cocktail of prescription medications and alcohol, the perpetrators decided that as he was still lucid to administer him a shot of heroin mixed with Oxycodone - a 'hot shot'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The drugs reacted with his existing medication and began to slow his heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>My 6'4" big beautiful brother regained consciousness long enough to try and make his way home - a short walk up the beach in the dark of night. Sadly, he collapsed and the incoming tide washed over him sealing what was already inevitable. Adam was found at dawn by a woman walking her dog. My brother died on his 22nd birthday, 23 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Due to many factors, which as an 18 year old girl, I found hard to fathom - and still do as a 41 year old woman, the investigation was a myriad of cover-ups, corruption and shear ineptitude, and the four perpetrators were never held accountable for their crime, and given the long jail sentences they deserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>We will never know if two of them would have ever atoned as they subsequently met their own untimely premature demise due to their toxic lifestyles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Of the two who remain alive, I understand that they have been in and out of jail in Queensland - however never for what they did to my brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>It is not the premise of my writing today to make comment on the flawed justice system that has not provided the mechanism for these two people to atone and become better citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>I have spoken previously on the impact that my brother's unnecessary death had on our family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>It was heartbreaking for me to deliver the news to my Dad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>It was exhausting and draining to watch my Mum slowly drink and drug herself to death from the guilt of leaving Adam alone that night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Even though I was living away from Adam's home and could not have 'saved him' if I wanted to, for many years I too struggled with enormous guilt that has at times manifested itself in substance abuse and certainly self-sabotage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>I have been very blessed to have attracted caring beautiful people into my life who have steered me back to the path of peace and success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>I am blessed to have raised three compassionate, driven and healthy children who are making their way in the world as fine young humans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Over the years, in my struggle to understand and come to terms with what happened to my beautiful brother, I have interacted intimately with many families who have lost a loved one through the use of drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>We have shared our stories, consoled each other in grief and been towers of strength at times when the sadness threatens to overwhelm - birthdays, anniversaries sometimes it can be just a song that evokes emotions that cause your chest to tighten and the tears to fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>I have found that all of these families are profoundly compassionate, and although we all at some deeper level hold some anger either towards those who caused (in my brother's case) our loved one to die, or even at our loved one for making stupid choices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>It is certainly true that many of us are angry at a society which allows drug trafficking to flourish and drug traffickers at the highest level to grow fat and wealthy on the back of so much misery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Of course we are angry at the traffickers down the line, like Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>We have every right to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Over the years, when the subject of the Bali 9 came up, it certainly brought some of that anger to the surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>However, like grief - anger can overwhelm you and certainly cloud your decision making abilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>I believe that Tanya Plibersek said recently when speaking in Parliament about the issue of the looming execution of Andrew and Myuran, and relating it to her own brother's violent death in Port Moresby in 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>'I know that if I had been the one making the decision about the punishment of the person who did that crime, I couldn't have thought of a punishment bad enough,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>As an evolved society we must hold fast to this premise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>We must continue to strive towards a rehabilitative and restorative criminal justice system that provides a mechanism for those willing to atone for their crimes and become better citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>In the case of Andrew and Myuran, whether or not you believe that the death penalty is warranted in certain cases (I don't but that is a discussion for another day), surely you cannot refute the fact that these men - despite being on death row for nearly a decade, in a prison system which provides for minimal rehabilitative opportunities, these young men have made it their mission to not only rehabilitate themselves, but through their work in Kerobokan Jail, which I have seen - they have become the benchmark for what rehabilitation should like worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>To those of you who are vociferous (look it up if you need to) in your baying for blood, the blood of Andrew and Myuran, I wonder what you think is to be gained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>However, the administrators of Kerobokan jail themselves have been outspoken in their praise of Andrew and Myuran as not only model prisoners, but for their work in reducing the drug taking within the prison itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Neither Andrew or Myuran or their families, or their growing army of supporters are asking for anything more than that they are allowed to serve their lives in prison in way that allows them to continue these good works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>The punishment is that they are to spend their lives in prison, away from their families, in a developing country where creature comforts such as space, working toilets and even basic safety are not the norm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>For me, that seems enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>I don't need to have their blood on my hands to feel less angry about what was done to my beautiful brother Adam - that is my journey, and thankfully through my writing, my interactions with extraordinary people and my friends and family, that anger is something I have largely dealt with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>So, to all you people who think you speak 'on behalf of the families' - YOU DON'T SPEAK FOR ME.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>I invite you to pause and consider what I have written, because although at times, I have been harsher and less polite than I usually am, it is because I am tired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>I am tired of going to sleep at night, only to wake up sad because of something awful I have read about the need to kill these men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Those of us who been through the loss of a son, brother, daughter, sister or other loved one through drugs seem to be the clearest and articulate voices for mercy towards Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>For me, I could no more wish the Chan or the Sukumaran families to suffer the pain of losing their loved one than I could load the gun and stand in line to shoot these men through their hearts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>If after reading this, you still (and I accept that many of you will) don't see a need to be merciful towards Andrew and Myu, please at least refrain from saying you speak for the 'families' of drug victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>You DO NOT speak for us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>You do not speak for me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>We stand for mercy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>I stand for mercy.</td></tr>

<h3>Rebel fire continues, says Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Amid the tensions, Moscow sternly warned cash-strapped Ukraine that its pay for Russian gas would only last for a few more days, raising the spectre of another gas war with potential repercussions for Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A Ukrainian military spokesman said the Russia-backed rebels fired on Ukrainian positions nearly 50 times in the past 24 hours and that Russia sent more tanks into Ukraine despite a ceasefire that was supposed to begin on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The rebels, meanwhile, claimed that Ukrainian forces had violated the ceasefire more than 20 times today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The government claims, which followed the rebel seizure of the key rail hub of Debaltseve, raised the question of whether weeks of high-level diplomacy aimed at producing a ceasefire and a peace plan had simply allowed the rebels to redouble efforts to grab more territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The village of Kurakhovo, west of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, was hit by Grad rockets and the village of Berdyansk, near the key port city of Mariupol, was hit overnight by artillery and mortar fire, Lt. Col Anatoliy Stelmakh, a Ukrainian military spokesman, told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Russia is still moving military equipment into Ukraine, including 10 tanks brought into Novoazovsk, near Mariupol, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>French President Francois Hollande, who brokered the peace deal last week together with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said today he did not have confirmation about Russian tanks entering Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"That doesn't mean this doesn't exist," he said, underscoring the need for the ceasefire to take hold and halt the risk of escalation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Vladislav Seleznyev, a spokesman for Ukraine's military general staff, said two soldiers had been killed in the past day and 110 were being held prisoner by the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Both sides were supposed to begin drawing back heavy weapons from the front lines on Tuesday, but international monitors say they have seen no signs of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Concerns are rising that the rebels are still gunning to take Mariupol, a government-held city on the Sea of Azov that could allow them to create a land bridge between Russia and Crimea, which Russia annexed last March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Crimea has no physical link to Russian territory now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Yesterday, the rebels celebrated their victory over Ukrainian forces in Debaltseve, a key transport hub linking the two largest rebel strongholds in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Rebel fighters roamed the town's debris-littered streets, laughing, hugging and posing for photos, although the death of one fighter when his vehicle hit a land mine was a sharp reminder of the dangers that still lurked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ukrainian soldiers who made it out of Debaltseve alive described weeks of harrowing rebel shelling, followed by a chaotic, hasty retreat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ukrainian officials said 13 soldiers had been killed and 157 wounded in the fighting, but the shell-shocked soldiers themselves spoke of many more casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Starting at night, they would fire at us just to stop us from sleeping. They did this all night," a Ukrainian soldier named Andrei said after fleeing Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Then in the morning, they would attack, wave after wave."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>While fighting continued in the east, Ukraine raised the pressure on the separatists yesterday by cutting off shipments of natural gas to the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The national gas company Naftogaz linked the cutoff to damaged gas transit infrastructure and said supplies were resumed later in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said today that Ukraine has still failed to restore gas shipments to the east, "putting people's lives and health under threat".</td></tr>
