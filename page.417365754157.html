<h3>Apple buys VR company: Report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple has just acquired Metaio, a leading augmented and virtual reality firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The deal was uncovered by Techcrunch which has unearthed documents detailing a share transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When it approached Apple for comment, it would neither confirm nor deny but did admit that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The discovery is generating excitement because many of Metaio's products are focused on bringing an augmented view to smartphone sand tablets -- such as overlays on maps or virtual tours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple recently patented a design for a portable virtual reality headset that uses a smartphone and this acquisition could be another step towards embracing the technology, which is expected to be mainstream by the decade's end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Have you bought the Apple Watch?</td></tr>
