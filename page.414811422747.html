<h3>Cameroon army kills 86 Boko Haram militants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nigeria-based Boko Haram has widened its attacks into neighbouring nations, notably Cameroon and Chad, in a conflict estimated to have claimed a total 13,000 lives since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have to eradicate Boko Haram," said President Paul Biya of Cameroon, as attendees agreed to create a 76 million euro ( 56m) fund to fight the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Biya said Boko Haram's disregard for human dignity meant "a total impossibility of compromise".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nigeria, where elections have been postponed by six weeks until late March because of Boko Haram activity in swaths of the north-east, was absent from the talks as it is not an Eccas member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The aim of Monday's discussion was to come up with a solution in the fight against the extremists, a source close to the Cameroonian government told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria have formed a military alliance to combat the notoriously brutal militants, who are fighting to create a hardline Islamic state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A Cameroonian army official announced that more than 1,000 people suspected of being affiliated with Boko Haram were being held in the town of Maroua, in the country's Far North region, where more than 2,000 Cameroonian soldiers have been deployed since August last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The detentions came as police in Niger said they had arrested more than 160 people suspected of having links to Boko Haram in the country's Diffa region, a border area with Nigeria which was attacked by the Islamist group this month.</td></tr>
