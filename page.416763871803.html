<h3>Ferguson mulls replacing mid-street shrine to Michael Brown</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FERGUSON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - Leaders of the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, are considering removing or replacing a makeshift shrine to Michael Brown that has lined the middle of the street where he was killed since last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The shrine to the unarmed black 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer is comprised of stuffed animals, flower pots and candles and is several yards long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The mayor says the shrine's location makes it a safety hazard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, removing it could stoke anger among community members who were outraged by Brown's killing and a grand jury's decision not to charge the officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A Washington-based mediator says one idea proposed to Brown's family and the city is replacing the shrine with a dove symbol that would be embedded in the asphalt.</td></tr>
