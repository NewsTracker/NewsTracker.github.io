<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NAPLES, Italy (AP) - The Pentagon's top general says the new U.S. military base being setting up in Iraq's western desert could be a model for more such U.S. hubs if Iraq is able to regain momentum against the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the comment Thursday in an interview with reporters traveling with him in Italy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dempsey said it will take several weeks to establish the base announced Wednesday by the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That one will be at an Iraqi air base in Anbar province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dempsey said another could eventually be established in north-central Iraq if and when the Iraqi army is ready to organize a counteroffensive in Mosul, which has been in Islamic State hands for 12 months.</td></tr>
