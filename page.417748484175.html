<h3>Carlos becomes a hurricane over Pacific off southwest Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MIAMI (AP) - Hurricane Carlos hovered Saturday over the Pacific Ocean south of Acapulco, Mexico, hours after a hurricane watch was issued for a swath of that country's southwest coastline, forecasters said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the hurricane's eye was centered at 2 p.m. EDT Saturday about 135 miles (215 kilometers) south of the tourist resort of Acapulco and that Carlos had top sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Forecasters said Carlos, a tropical storm only hours earlier, had gained strength overnight and was nearly stationary on Saturday afternoon and "meandering."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mexico's government has issued a hurricane watch from Lazaro Cardenas to Punta San Telmo along Mexico's southwest mainland coast, meaning hurricane conditions were possible within that area within 48 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A tropical storm warning also was in effect from Tecpan de Galeana to Lazaro Cardenas, while a tropical storm watch was in effect for areas east of Tecpan de Galeana to Acapulco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Carlos is the third hurricane of the 2015 eastern Pacific season, and forecasters said hurricane-force winds extend outward from the eye about 25 miles (35 kilometers).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The center also cautioned that ocean swells kicked up by Carlos will reach the coast in the warning and watch areas over the next days and could produce life-threatening surf and rip currents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Carlos was expected to increase its forward speed over coming days on a forecast track paralleling the coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Forecasters said the storm could see some increase in strength in coming days.</td></tr>
