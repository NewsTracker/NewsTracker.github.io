<h3>Microsoft looking to hire autistic employees</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Microsoft's push for diversity extends beyond gender and race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The computer giant, whose CEO said last year that women should wait for "karma" to promote them, is looking to recruit 10 candidates with autism as part of a new pilot program to expand diversity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"People with autism bring strengths that we need at Microsoft," Mary Ellen Smith, Microsoft's corporate vice president for worldwide operations, wrote in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Some have amazing ability to retain information, think at a level of detail and depth or excel in math or code. It's a talent pool that we want to continue to bring to Microsoft."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Smith's own 19-year-old son is autistic, she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company will work with Specialisterne, a Danish firm that connects autistic people with jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Specialisterne was profiled by the New York Times Magazine in a 2012 feature on how tech companies could benefit from autistic workers because their skill sets match the rigorous yet sometimes monotonous parts of the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Microsoft caught heat in October when CEO Satya Nadella suggested that women shouldn't ask for raises but rather let the universe work in promoting them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He quickly apologized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At the end of last year, Microsoft released some of its diversity stats and, after more pressure, its EEO-1 report, which further delves into internal data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The EEO-1 form tallied 116 white executive-level employees, and just two black, 20 Asian, 1 biracial, and 0 American Indian or Pacific Islander execs.</td></tr>
