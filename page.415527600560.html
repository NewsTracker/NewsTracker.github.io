<h3>Ukraine Scrambles to Avoid New Unrest Flashpoint in the East</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Although now under government control, Kostyantynivka was held by rebel forces for almost three months last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Attitudes toward the Ukrainian authorities vary widely and many residents retain sympathies for the Russia-backed separatists the government is fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On Monday night, hours after the accident, clashes broke out in front of a dormitory commandeered by soldiers fighting the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Enraged crowds turned over a police car and set fire to a bus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities said they detained the ringleaders of the unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Donetsk region head of police Vyacheslav Abroskin, who rushed to Kostyantynivka on Tuesday in a bid to soothe tempers, was met by more than 50 people, including mothers with small children, at the scene of Monday's accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many vented their frustration at what they said was the often-drunken conduct of soldiers in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It has become dangerous to walk around. We have seen it all before, military vehicles are driving very fast here and there all the time," said Kostyantynivka resident Alexander Tsibulyev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At a later gathering, an even larger crowd, which included clusters of aggressive and drunk young men, shouted demands for all troops to leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said troops in charge of the light-armored tow vehicle involved in the crash were among several people under investigation and their commander had been suspended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The case is being supervised personally by the chief military prosecutor and the president of Ukraine," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The prompt reaction by senior Ukrainian officials underlines anxiety over any renewal of the unrest that last year spiraled into a war which has left more than 6,000 dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A February cease-fire between government and rebel forces in the east has eased hostilities, but Russia has complained that Ukraine is falling short on holding local elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Under the cease-fire, Ukraine was to rewrite its constitution to decentralize power and adopt a law recognizing the special status of rebel-held areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Russia's Foreign Ministry complained Tuesday that a draft bill presented to parliament by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had reneged on holding talks with representatives of areas under rebel control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Poroshenko, however, said Kiev would deal only with eastern representatives elected in line with international standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Peter Leonard in Kiev, Ukraine, contributed.</td></tr>
