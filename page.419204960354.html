<h3>Clinton to propose $350 billion college affordability plan</h3>

<tr><td>3</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Calling for a "new college compact," Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday will unveil a $350 billion plan aimed at making college more affordable and reducing the crushing burden of student debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At a town hall meeting in New Hampshire, the state with the highest average student debt in the country, Clinton will propose steps to reduce the cost of four-year public schools, make two-year community colleges tuition-free and cut student loan interest rates, according to campaign aides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The college affordability plan, a main plank of her policy platform, is an effort to address a major financial stress for many American families and satisfy a central demand of the Democratic party's liberal wing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The proposal centers on a $200 billion federal incentive system aimed at encouraging states to expand their investments in higher education and cut student costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>States that guarantee "no-loan" tuition at four-year public schools and free tuition at community colleges will be eligible to receive federal funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Clinton doesn't go quite as far as some more liberal politicians and party activists, who've made "debt-free college" an early litmus test for the presidential primary field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In May, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released his own plan that would eliminate tuition and fees for public universities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The $70 billion annual proposal would be funded by imposing a tax on transactions by hedge funds, investment houses and other Wall Street firms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While military veterans, lower-income students and those who complete a national service program, like AmeriCorps, would go to school for free in the Clinton plan, others would incur costs for their schooling and living expenses at four-year public universities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"For many students, it would translate into debt-free tuition," said Carmel Martin, executive vice president for policy at the Center for American Progress, who advised Clinton on that plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It will depend on the student circumstances and the institution they are going to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For most students, their families will still be expected to make a "realistic" contribution, say Clinton's aides, and students will contribute wages from ten hours of work per week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Those currently repaying loans would be able to refinance their outstanding debt at lower rates, a change Clinton's aides say will save an average of $2,000 for 25 million borrowers over the life of the loan - an amount that equal to just about $17 month over a ten year repayment period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>She would also expand income-based repayment programs, allowing every student borrower to enroll in a plan that would cap their payments at 10 percent of their income with remaining debt forgiven after 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Private universities with "modest endowments" that serve a higher percentage of low-income students, including historically black colleges, would also receive federal funds to help lower the costs of attendance and improve graduation rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The cost of Clinton's plan would be offset by capping itemized tax deductions for wealthy families at 28 percent, like those taken by high-income taxpayers for charitable contributions and mortgage interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That proposal, which has long been included in President Barack Obama's annual budget, would raise more than $600 billion in the next decade, according to the Treasury Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Clinton's plan would likely face a steep climb in Congress: A $60 billion Obama administration initiative for free community college has gotten little traction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Republican presidential candidates criticized the costs of Clinton's proposal on Monday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Every time you add more money and financial aid, (traditional colleges) raise their tuition rates," said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in an interview on Fox News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"That's what's going to happen here again unless they have competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, released a statement saying the proposal would "raise the cost of college even further and shift the burden to hardworking taxpayers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>College affordability has emerged as a major issue on the presidential campaign trail, as families face the highest debt burden in generations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>National student debt is near $1.3 trillion dollars and the average price for in-state students at public four-year universities is 42 percent higher than it was a decade ago, according to the College Board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Clinton aides believe their plan will help build enthusiasm for her candidacy with younger voters - whose support twice helped catapult Obama into the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The policy roll-out is timed for when students return to college campuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Clinton organizers plan to promote the plan at registration events and other gatherings kicking-off the school year, according to a campaign aide, in an effort to galvanize college students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has advocated to elevate college affordability to a top political issue, praised Clinton's "bold proposal" as "big and ambitious."</td></tr>
