<h3>Rescue teams reach cyclone stricken Vanuatu islands, official toll lowered</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Relief workers were still battling to reach many of the islands pummeled by Cyclone Pam's gusts of more than 300 kph (185 mph) on Friday and Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With communications cut off and reconnaissance flights revealing destroyed houses, shredded forests and damaged buildings, international aid agencies had been particularly worried about Tanna, which bore the full force of the storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A Reuters witness on the island of 29,000 people, about 200 km (125 miles) south of the capital, said that while damage was extensive, it appeared most of the population had survived by sheltering in schools, churches and other sturdy buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"People sheltered in school buildings. We were helping one another," Ropate Vuso, 67, told Reuters in Tanna township.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are running short of food, water, shelter and electricity. We have no communications, we are still waiting for the people from parliament, the chief and the president, but still nobody is coming."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There were unconfirmed reports of four deaths in and around the main town of Tanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Oxfam's Vanuatu country manager, Colin Collett van Rooyen, said an assessment flight over the island of Erromango, north of Tanna with a population of around 2,000, had revealed huge damage there too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"What we have seen is damage in some villages, at the upper range, of 70, 80, 90 percent, one village in particular 100 percent," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"These are small villages but massive destruction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Aircraft flying over other outlying islands had seen large white "Hs" marked out on the ground, or residents trying to signal for help with mirrors, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The United Nations said on Tuesday the official death toll from the cyclone was 11, revising down its earlier figure of 24, but many officials anticipate that number would rise once they are able to more thoroughly inspect the outer islands of the scattered archipelago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sweden said on Tuesday a Swedish man aged around 80 who had emigrated was among the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In Vanuatu capital Port Vila the clean-up was progressing after trees were uprooted and homes flattened, but there were worries about food scarcity and health after the main local food market was destroyed and the city's hospital severely damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Bishop said Australia was sending a 20-strong emergency medical assistance team of doctors, nurses, paramedics and a pharmacist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They plan to set up a temporary ward in the car park of the damaged Port Vila hospital capable of treating up to 40 patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Thousands are still staying in shelters overnight, with a 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew in place to prevent looting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The majority of locals rely on foods sold at the downtown market such as taro, island cabbage, bananas, kumara and yams for their staple diet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Shops selling tinned food were open and stocked in the capital, but many locals do not have the money to buy them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We have water, but the situation is very bad because people don't have local food," shop owner Colette Calvo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"All they can eat is food like bananas that they pick up off the ground and they can get sick."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Australia, which has already sent five planes with personnel and humanitarian supplies, dispatched another three planes on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It also began loading its emergency response ship HMAS Tobruk, which is capable of driving onto beaches, for possible deployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A French navy ship was also being sent from nearby New Caledonia, while a U.S Marine Corps-based Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief team was also being made ready, Australian defense officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Formerly known as the New Hebrides, Vanuatu, one of the world's poorest nations, is a sprawling cluster of more than 80 islands and 260,000 people, 2,000 km (1,250 miles) northeast of the Australian city of Brisbane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tourism, which accounts for about 40 percent of Vanuatu's economy, has been badly affected, with Port Vila closed to cruise liners indefinitely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Almost 200 people, most of whom were Australian tourists or workers, were evacuated on two Australian military flights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Australia had another plane on standby on Tuesday to evacuate the elderly, the sick, pregnant women and children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Aid officials said the storm was comparable in strength to Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people.</td></tr>

<h3>Tony Abbott offends Irish leader with St Patrick's Day message</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mr Abbott, who recently survived a move from within his own party to have him replaced, made the awkward video last week, where he alludes to Ireland's national day as one for parties and drinking Guinness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Perhaps true for many, but Ireland's Taoiseach Enda Kenny was not amused, rejecting the "perception" that Ireland and St Patrick's Day was synonymous with alcohol and heavy drinking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I've heard the prime minister's comments," Mr Kenny told the Irish Independent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"He made them. I don't agree with that. I think that it is perfectly in order for so many Irish people in Australia to have an enjoyable celebration of St Patrick's Day and St Patrick's week, and to do so in a thoroughly responsible fashion," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There has been a long-term view of a stage Irish perception. I reject that. I think it's really important that we understand that we have a national day that can be celebrated worldwide, St Patrick's Day."</td></tr>
