<h3>Senate passes GOP budget plan targeting 'Obamacare'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The U.S. Senate on Tuesday, May 5, 2015 narrowly passed a Republican budget plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Rep. Thomas "Tom" Price, a Republican from Georgia and chairman of the House Budget Committee, holds up a copy of the House Republicans' Fiscal Year 2016 budget proposal titled "A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America" during a news conference with other members of the budget committee in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, March 17, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The U.S. Senate on Tuesday narrowly passed a Republican budget plan that prescribes deep domestic spending cuts to eliminate deficits by 2024 and aids the party's goal of trying to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The first combined House-Senate budget in six years passed 51-48 with all Senate Democrats voting against it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, both presidential contenders, were the only Republicans who voted against the blueprint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, also seeking the White House, voted in its favor, as did Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a potential presidential candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>All Democrats voted in opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Senator David Vitter, a Republican who is running for Louisiana governor this year, did not cast a vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Senate Republicans hailed it as the first balanced budget plan since a 2001 surplus, hoping to score points among voters worried about mounting U.S. debt levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"American families know they can't live on borrowed money, and neither can the federal government," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi of Wyoming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This balanced budget shows these families that if they can do it, so can we."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Democrats blasted the measure for getting the bulk of its savings from cuts to programs that help the poor and middle class while leaving tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, including a proposal to eliminate taxes on multimillion-dollar inheritances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This is an absolute disaster for the working families of this country," said Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who's running for the Democratic presidential nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In fact, one of the problems that I have had in describing the Republican budget is that it is so bad ... that people don't even really believe you when you talk about what is in this budget."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The non-binding resolution does not go to Obama's desk to be signed into law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Instead, it helps guide Congressional consideration of government agency spending bills and serves as a Republican fiscal policy manifesto that will influence 2016 election campaigns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The blueprint would slash spending on the social safety net, education, infrastructure and other domestic programs by $5.3 trillion over 10 years with no tax increases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At the same time, it boosts defense spending next year by adding about $38 billion to an off-budget war operations account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The GOP document also lacks specifics about which programs would be cut, insulating the Senate's large crop of vulnerable incumbents from taking a more politically dangerous vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But most of the prescribed cuts will be ignored, as the new budget plan does not instruct congressional committees to implement them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Instead, the "reconciliation" instructions are focused on easing the way to repealing the Affordable Care Act, or "Obamacare."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The measure assumes Republicans will find about $1 trillion over 10 years to replace "Obamacare" taxes like the 3.8 percent surcharge on investment income paid by upper-bracket earners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It also retains large Obamacare cuts to health care providers such as Medicare Advantage plans even though Republicans criticized the cuts in past campaigns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest disparaged the budget plan for increasing money for defense but not for non-defense domestic programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In the wake of racial tensions involving police and low-income communities, Earnest specifically argued the Republican plan would jeopardize programs that provide criminal justice assistance to state and local governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Republicans have started talking the talk about issues like inequality and criminal justice reform, but their budget shows they are not walking the walk," Earnest said.</td></tr>
