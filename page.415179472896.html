<h3>Boris Nemtsov's funeral: Thousands of mourners gather in Moscow to view Putin critic's body</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The crowd that amassed was so large that even after the official four-hour public viewing of Mr Nemtsov's body at the Sakharov Centre ended, a queue of people running for hundreds of metres stood waiting outside the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Nemtsov, a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin and the former deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, was shot dead late on Friday as he and his girlfriend walked on a bridge near the Kremlin, in the heart of the Russian capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The killing has deeply impacted Russia's small opposition movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fears that his death was ordered by the Kremlin have been stoked by an unfruitful police investigation for suspects and a motive, which has entered its fourth day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>US ambassador John Tefft, former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, Russian deputy prime ministers Sergei Prikhodko all viewed Mr Nemtsov's body today, along with tycoon and New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov - who ran against Mr Putin in the 2012 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They probably know that if they don't come, then at some point people will be coming for them," Irina Khakamada, co-leader of a liberal party in parliament with Mr Nemtsov, said of the Russian officials' presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>However, Polish and Latvian politicians were unable to attend the event, after Moscow banned them from entering the country - a move condemned by the EU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Veteran human rights activist Lev Ponomarev said a re-awakening of nationalism and intolerance towards dissent that has emerged under Mr Putin has coarsened society and encouraged violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"In this atmosphere of violence and hate, these killings will only continue," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ordinary citizens touched by Nemtsov's death also lined the streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He was our ray of light. With his help, I think Russia would have risen up and become a strong country. It is the dream of all progressive people in Russia," said 80-year-old Valentina Gorbatova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I am here to show that aside from the 80% of Russians who don't watch anything but state television and don't think for themselves, there are ... us, who do think and see that the government system is unfair and that we need to change a lot in our country," said Marsel Shamsudinov, who had come from the city of Kazan, 700 kilometres (450 miles) to the east to pay his respects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>After the viewing, his body was buried at a cemetery on Moscow's western edge, as relatives and about 100 bystanders looked on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The authorities will now continue their investigation into Nemtsov's death, after Putin's spokesman called the killing a "provocation" aimed at tarnishing Mr Putin's image.</td></tr>

<h3>Katy Perry Reveals Why Snoop Dogg Wasn't in Her Halftime Show</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When Katy Perry headlined the Super Bowl last month, her guests included Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, it turns out Perry wanted to bring another guest on as well -- Snoop Dogg -- but the NFL nixed the idea, she claimed, because of the "hate" he'd allegedly bring to the party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Speaking to Elle magazine for its March issue, Perry said that the NFL said she couldn't have Snoop because of his feud with Iggy Azalea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Not that that was it -- that was just the tipping point," Perry added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"You can't have that kind of hate at the Super Bowl. They already have enough female-hate problems; they don't need any more."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Snoop and Azalea feuded last fall, when he dissed her appearance on Instagram and then posted an obscenity-filled video further insulting and threatening her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He later apologized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It's worth noting that Perry and Azalea are friendly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In fact, Perry even co-wrote Azalea's hit "Black Widow."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When asked for comment, an NFL spokesperson responded, "We're on to Super Bowl 50."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A rep for Snoop Dogg has not yet responded to a request for comment.</td></tr>
