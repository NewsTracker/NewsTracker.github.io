<h3>Bali nine: executions could be delayed months as judges re-examine Filipina maid's case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The decision is significant for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan because Indonesian authorities have consistently said they intend to execute all 10 drug felons simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Filipina maid Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Supreme Court spokesman Suhadi said a panel of judges would be appointed this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"After that the panel will examine and study her case. It will take months," he said in Kompas newspaper on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Filipina domestic worker Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso was sentenced to death in 2010 for attempting to smuggle 2.6 kilograms of heroin from Malaysia to Yogyakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Veloso maintains she was deceived by an acquaintance and did not know the drugs were in her suitcase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Her lawyer argued she deserved a case review because the translator during her trial was only a student who did not have a license from the Association of Indonesian Translators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Case reviews take up to three months to be determined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On March 12, Attorney-General spokesman Tony Spontana said Indonesian authorities would wait on the result of all legal processes lodged by the felons on death row before proceeding with the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said simultaneous executions were "more efficient and effective".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We don't want one to have to wait for another's execution before his own. That will affect the convicts' psychological state," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nine of the 10 drug felons are now understood to have launched legal proceedings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran will have an appeal against the rejection of their clemency plea heard on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Judicial Commission is also investigating claims the judges who sentenced them to death offered a lighter sentence in exchange for bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Meanwhile, the head of the Central Java Prosecutor's Office, Hartadi, warned Indonesia's sovereignty was at stake if the second batch of executions failed to take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In a speech at a ceremony to induct new officials, Hartadi reportedly said the president said the executions must go ahead despite foreigners manoeuvring to have the executions cancelled or at least delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The Prosecutor's office as part of the law enforcement system must not be daunted by the diplomatic approaches," Mr Hartadi said in Kompas.</td></tr>

<h3>Attorney for Ferguson suspect: Officers shot 'accidentally'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A man accused of shooting two police officers in Ferguson returned to court Tuesday over a claim that St. Louis County police used excessive force during his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A circuit court judge agreed to defense lawyer Jerryl Christmas' request to photograph Jeffrey L. Williams in the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Online court records indicate prosecutors took their own photos at the brief hearing, which came one day after Williams, 20, made his first appearance in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Christmas told The Associated Press on Monday that police roughed up his client and described bruises on Williams' back, shoulders and face and a knot on his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police spokesman Brian Schellman called the assertion "completely false" while noting that the suspect was seen by a nurse when he was booked into the county jail, standard procedure for all incoming inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He added that Williams did not resist arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Christmas also suggested that police coerced a statement by Williams in which he reportedly admitted to the shooting but said he wasn't targeting police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Schellman also rejected that assertion, noting the statement was videotaped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Williams, shackled at the waist and feet, was led into a jury room Tuesday, where he was photographed, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was then returned to county lock-up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Christmas said some of the injuries are visible in a police mug shot distributed Sunday, the Post-Dispatch reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said red marks can be seen on his client's throat and cheek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Williams is accused of shooting the two officers early Thursday outside Ferguson's police station, which has been the scene of protests since last summer's fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Williams was arrested Sunday on charges of felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In his interview with the AP on Monday, Christmas countered an earlier description by St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar of the March 12 shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"This wasn't any type of ambush shooting," Christmas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Those officers were shot accidentally."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Christmas later said in other media interviews that Williams didn't fire the shots at the officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He did not respond to several messages Tuesday seeking to clarify the discrepancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Police have said Williams told investigators he was aiming instead at someone with whom he had a dispute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But that assertion was met with skepticism by St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We're not sure we completely buy that part of it," the prosecutor said Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Christmas told the AP he wasn't aware of any details regarding a possible dispute that could have preceded the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The shooting happened as a demonstration began to break up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The protest followed the resignation of city Police Chief Tom Jackson in the wake of a Justice Department report that found widespread racial bias in the city's police practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Williams is jailed on $300,000 bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Ferguson Police Department has been a national focal point since Brown, who was black and unarmed, was killed by police officer Darren Wilson, who is white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A grand jury declined to indict Wilson in November, and Wilson was cleared of civil rights charges by a Justice Department report released March 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Wilson resigned in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A separate Justice Department report found widespread racial bias in the city's policing and in a municipal court system driven by profit extracted from mostly black and low-income residents.</td></tr>
