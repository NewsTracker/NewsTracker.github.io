<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this March 22, 2015, file photo, Michael Sam runs through a drill during the NFL Super Regional Combine football workout in Tempe, Ariz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Montreal Alouettes have signed defensive end Michael Sam, the first openly gay player drafted in the NFL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The club says the free agent has agreed to a two-year deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>MONTREAL (AP) -- Michael Sam has found a pro football job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sam, the first openly gay player drafted in the NFL, signed a two-year contract Friday with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>General manager Jim Popp considered Sam's sexuality a nonissue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''Michael Sam is a very good football player, and that's the reason we signed him,'' Popp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He also was unemployed after failing to stick with two NFL teams last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sam came out before last year's NFL draft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was selected in the seventh round by the St. Louis Rams and cut in training camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Dallas Cowboys signed him to their practice squad but released him in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sam then made another unsuccessful attempt at an NFL job at this year's veterans combine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I cannot wait to put on the pads, get back on the field and work hard each and every day with my teammates to bring a Grey Cup to the great fans here in Montreal,'' Sam said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The 25-year-old defensive end will be introduced at a news conference Tuesday in Montreal and report to training camp the following day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The regular season opens June 25 when Montreal hosts Ottawa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sam starred at Missouri in college, earning SEC Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>After he came out, his NFL jersey was an instant best-seller and President Barack Obama publicly congratulated Sam and the Rams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>CFL Commissioner Jeffrey Orridge did the same Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''Congratulations to the Montreal Alouettes on the signing of Michael Sam,'' Orridge said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''Our players come to us from different places, different walks of life and ultimately they take different paths to get to our fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Aware of Sam's celebrity, the team immediately put his No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>94 Alouettes jersey on sale on its website for $139.95.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Alouettes had Sam on their negotiation list, and Popp said he was in contact with him all along.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''Each time he was let go, there were discussions,'' Popp said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Popp said Sam was considered a ''tweener'' by NFL clubs, not quite the right body type to be a defensive end or an outside linebacker for that league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But he may fit perfectly in the CFL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Popp believes Sam can follow a path similar to that of Cam Wake, who was converted from linebacker to end when he joined the B.C. Lions in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Wake was the CFL Defensive Player of the Year in each of his two seasons before signing with the Miami Dolphins, where he has had a successful NFL career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''If he proves (NFL) people wrong it would be great for us, and I think he can do it,'' Popp said.</td></tr>
