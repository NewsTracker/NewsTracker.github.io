<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mourners attend funeral for Baltimore man who died in police custody Add to...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mourners lined up on Monday before the funeral of a Baltimore black man who died in police custody, a death that has led to protests in the latest outcry over U.S. law enforcement's treatment of minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The long line stretched out of the front door of the New Shiloh Baptist Church for the funeral of 25-year-old Freddie Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police say he died of a neck injury on April 19 after being arrested on April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I am here to show that Freddie's loss of life was not in vain," said Joe Jones, head of the Center for Urban Families, which provides aid to local residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There's a lot of frustration, a lot of disappointment," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is a microcosm of things that are happening" to young black men across the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Gray's body, clad in a white shirt, black tie and dark pants, lay in an open coffin at the head of the altar of the church, which holds 2,500 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A choir accompanied by a small instrumental group performed religious music before the funeral started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>President Barack Obama was sending Broderick Johnson, the head of his initiative for minority males, to attend Gray's funeral, the White House said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Protests in the largely black city have been mostly peaceful, but vandalism and violence flared during a march on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thirty-five people were arrested, six officers were hurt, and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and police blamed outside agitators for the unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The protest was the latest expression of a national outcry over a white-dominated U.S. law enforcement establishment that civil rights leaders accuse of routinely mistreating black people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gray was arrested when he fled from police in a high-crime area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was carrying a switchblade knife, and he was put inside a transport van to be taken to a police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At some point, Gray suffered the spinal injury that led to his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>City Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said on Friday that officers failed to give him timely medical attention while he was in custody and failed to seatbelt him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police have said they would conclude their investigation by Friday and forward the results to state prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Six police officers have been suspended, and the U.S. Justice Department is investigating the incident for possible civil rights violations.</td></tr>
