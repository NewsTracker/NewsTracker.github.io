<h3>Syria's Assad says Islamic State has expanded since start of U.S. air strikes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Assad, who has been fighting Islamist and other rebels since 2011, said in the interview aired on Sunday there were some estimates that Islamic State was attracting 1,000 recruits a month in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"And Iraq - they are expanding in - in Libya and - many other - al Qaeda affiliate organizations have announced their allegiance to ISIS. So that's the situation," Assad said, using another acronym for the militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Washington is seeking a negotiated settlement to Syria's civil war that excludes Assad, but has made clear its top priority in Syria is the fight against Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Asked under what circumstances he would leave power, Assad said: "When I don't have the public support. When I don't represent the Syrian interests, and values."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In reply to a question about how he determined what support he had among Syrians, he said: "I don't determine. I sense. I feel. I'm in contact with them."</td></tr>
