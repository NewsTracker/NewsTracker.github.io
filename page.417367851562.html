<h3>Sepp Blatter re-elected as head of scandal-plagued FIFA</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sepp Blatter during FIFA's elections on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ZURICH - Sepp Blatter was re-elected as FIFA president for a fifth term on Friday, chosen to lead world soccer despite separate U.S. and Swiss criminal investigations into corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 209 FIFA member federations gave the 79-year-old Blatter another four-year term after Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan conceded defeat after losing 133-73 in the first round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Prince Ali's promise of a clean break from FIFA's tarnished recent history was rejected despite the worst scandal in the organization's 111-year history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The election went ahead Friday after U.S. and Swiss federal investigations struck at the heart of Blatter's "football family" this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Two FIFA vice presidents and a recently elected FIFA executive committee member were still in custody Friday as the votes were counted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, soccer leaders worldwide stayed loyal to their embattled president of 17 years, even though Prince Ali pushed the election to a second round by getting a surprising 73 votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Before the second round started, Prince Ali stood before the congress and conceded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Blatter has blamed others for bringing shame and humiliation on the sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a pre-election address to voters Friday, Blatter said it was "impossible" for him and FIFA to "keep an eye" on everyone and be responsible for everything that happened in world soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Blatter won despite calls for his resignation from UEFA president Michel Platini and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Platini said Thursday that UEFA could pull out of FIFA and withdraw from the World Cup if Blatter was re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>FIFA's big-money sponsors have also called for change within FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Visa warned Thursday that it could pull out of its contract, which is worth at least $25 million a year through 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The defeated 39-year-old prince was a FIFA vice president for the past four years with a close-up view of Blatter's previous scandal-hit mandate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Blatter was re-elected unopposed in 2011 after promising to fight corruption and support key investigations of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding contests and a bribery scandal which removed his Qatari opponent from the presidential ballot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Those probes were conducted in-house by FIFA's own judicial bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The latest investigations promise deeper trouble for FIFA, with federal law enforcement agencies delving into soccer's affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Raids on FIFA's favorite luxury downtown Zurich hotel and its own headquarters were launched early Wednesday by Swiss police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Senior FIFA officials were among seven men arrested at the request of American federal prosecutors investigating bribery, money-laundering and wire fraud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The 2018 and 2022 World Cups - awarded to Russia and Qatar, respectively - are the focus of a separate Swiss federal probe of suspected financial wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Last November, Blatter and FIFA filed a criminal complaint with the Swiss attorney general's office against non-Swiss nationals.</td></tr>
