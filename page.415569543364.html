<h3>Yahoo pulls the plug on China office</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Beijing research centre is Yahoo's only remaining physical presence in the country after it sold its Chinese operations to Alibaba in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A spokesperson said "around 350 jobs" would be eliminated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We are constantly making changes to align resources, and to foster better collaboration and innovation across our business," Yahoo said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The news that Yahoo was closing its last remaining office in mainland China travelled fast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Outside the Yahoo research centre, an employment agency staged a guerrilla-style PR campaign offering the sacked staff new jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many Yahoo employees appeared unimpressed as they walked by men dressed up in silver, alien outfits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One employee said the news was "very sad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He added, "I had good relations with my colleagues and now I need to say goodbye."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The move by the internet giant, however, doesn't come as a huge surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Yahoo has been rapidly retreating from the Chinese market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In 2013, it stopped offering services to email users in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's had an often fraught relationship with the Chinese government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Controversially the firm handed over information to the authorities that led to the jailing of two Chinese dissidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But according to reports, this closure was nothing to do with government pressure or censorship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Instead it's been driven by the internet giant's desire to cut its global operating costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Yahoo has been struggling to maintain profit growth in the face of growing competition from rival online search portals like Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Sunnyvale, California-based firm has also been trying to adapt to consumers increasingly using mobile devices, which attract less advertising revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As a result, Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has made a slew of acquisitions in a bid to diversify business and add new revenue streams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Earlier this year, Yahoo also announced plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company, which is valued at more than $30bn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The tech giant also owns a lucrative stake in Yahoo Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Yahoo had a global workforce of about 12,500 workers at the end of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Yahoo is the latest US technology firm to exit operations in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Google partially withdrew in 2010 after clashing with Chinese authorities over censorship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Earlier this year gamemaker Zynga closed its office and shed more than 70 jobs after its products failed to gain traction against local competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Shaun Rein, managing director of consultancy China Market Research said it was very difficult for consumer-facing foreign internet players to find success in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Unlike rest of the world, they're facing well-funded, aggressive home-grown players," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"In China you have really strong entrepreneurship in the online space and they're able to react quicker to consumer trends."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mr Rein added that it makes sense for Yahoo to "cull through headcount and business lines that aren't making a profit".</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"When you're as weak as Yahoo globally, it doesn't make sense to have a research and development arm in China since its too expensive."</td></tr>
