<h3>Google+ profile no longer needed for YouTube,</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google begins to wane off mandatory Google+ profiles, YouTube first to make the change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google+ profile no longer needed for YouTube, other Google platforms Google begins to wane off mandatory Google+ profiles, YouTube first to make the change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Though it's been declared over more times than we can count, it looks like Google's social network is finally on death's door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The writing has been on the wall for a while now but Google is finally breaking up with Google+.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google+ profiles will no longer be the be-all and end-all identity for users across the company's platforms such as YouTube, Google said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bradley Horowitz, Google's vice president of streams, photos and sharing, wrote in a blog post Monday that although the company got certain things right with Google+, there were a few choices that, "in hindsight, we've needed to rethink."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Google+ launched in June 2011 as a social network to give users a single identity across all Google platforms, and offer some competition to rival Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But some users did not react well to the forced integration with Google+.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier," Horowitz said, "but we've also heard that it doesn't make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a bid to make a "more focused, more useful, more engaging" Google+, Horowitz said, over the next few months the company will unravel certain Google+ features and only require a Google account for access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Unlike the public Google+ profiles, Google accounts are not searchable or followable, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>With these changes, people who don't use Google+ will not need a public profile to use other Google products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The first platform to make the break will be YouTube, which previously required users to have a Google+ account to comment, share, or upload videos on the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Starting today, users will only need a Google account to engage on YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Comments made on YouTube will not appear on Google+, and vise versa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Google announced last week that it's shutting down Google+ Photos by Aug. 1 to make room for a stand-alone Google Photos app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>We have been liberated from Google+ YES!!!!!!!!!!</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Reports saying Google+ will be removed from YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>May be messy, but I am so damn happy right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Google Plus and Youtube are finally splitting up!</td></tr>
