<h3>Bali nine executions: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to learn Monday afternoon if final legal challenge allowed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A panel of three judges will rule at 3.30pm (AEST) on whether the State Administrative Court of Jakarta has the authority to examine a challenge to President Joko Widodo's rejection of the clemency pleas for the men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The court has ruled several times previously that presidential clemency falls outside its jurisdiction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However the Australians' Indonesian lawyer has vowed to keep fighting to save the men's lives if the appeal is rejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Professor Todung Mulya Lubis, a well-known human rights advocate, told Fairfax the legal team was "still trying to think outside the box".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We will have to find our way and ground to launch another legal action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran were sentenced to death over their roles in a foiled attempt to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin to Australia in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They appealed for mercy to Mr Joko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He rejected their clemency pleas - and those of 62 other drug felons on death row - on the basis Indonesia was in a state of emergency due to a drug crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Joko said the rejection of clemency served as "important shock therapy" for drug dealers, traffickers and users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If the Administrative Court appeal is allowed, the pair's lawyers will challenge this blanket refusal of clemency pleas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They will argue the president should have assessed each plea on its merits and taken into account the well-documented rehabilitation of Chan and Sukumaran in Bali's Kerobokan jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo has described the men'sappeal as a "weird legal process anyway, which is taken just to buy time to postpone their execution".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"One cannot challenge the president's decision on clemency because it is subject to the president's prerogative," he said in the Jakarta Post last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Asked how confident he was the appeal would be allowed on Monday, Professor Mulya said: "This is a very tough question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Legally I am very confident because granting or rejecting clemency should be made with reasons in accordance with the law and fairness. However, prevailing opinion seems to give a carte blanche to the president, namely, the president may use his rights according to his discretion," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The legal team has not ruled out launching legal action in the Constitutional Court but any decision would not be retrospective and therefore it could not save the lives of the Bali nine pair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Judicial Commission is also investigating claims by the men's previous lawyer that the judges who sentenced the men to death offered lighter sentences in exchange for bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I do not know to what extent the investigation has been completed. We will keep monitoring the process," Professor Mulya said.</td></tr>
