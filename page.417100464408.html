<h3>Barack Obama moves to demilitarise US cops after Baltimore and Ferguson protests</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>RAW VIDEO: President Barack Obama announces the end to a federal program that supplies local police departments with surplus military gear, saying it alienates the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Washington: President Barack Obama has barred police from using tracked armoured vehicles, bayonets, grenade launchers and large-calibre firearms, in response to accusations that US law enforcement has become too militarised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After controversy over the policing of high-profile protests in Baltimore, Maryland and Ferguson, Missouri, Obama said communities should not feel there is an "occupying force" in their neighbourhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Each of the demonstrations were met with police deployments, which Obama agreed appeared more like a military style operation - with tactical units in full combat gear atop armoured personnel carriers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>St Louis County Police tactical team fires tear gas into a crowd of people in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We've seen how militarised gear can sometimes give people a feeling like there's an occupying force as opposed to a force that's part of the community that's protecting them and serving them," Obama said in announcing the measures on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It can alienate and intimidate local residents and send the wrong message."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The protests in both cities were prompted by the killing of unarmed black men by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>According to US law, the use of deadly force by police is only justifiable if a suspect poses a credible threat to the officer or the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Obama's measures would bar the purchase of some military uniforms, firearms of .50 calibre or greater, grenade launchers and bayonets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Many of the recommendations have long been advocated by civil liberties groups, which say billions of dollars' worth of military equipment is transferred from the federal government to police departments every year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This equipment never belonged in our neighbourhoods," said Kanya Bennett of the American Civil Liberties Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She described the measures as "a critical step towards rebuilding trust".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But critics say the named weapons are rarely used by police, who will still be allowed under certain circumstances to use wheeled armoured vehicles, Humvees, drones and riot batons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Obama was speaking in Camden, New Jersey, which once had one of the country's highest violent crime rates.</td></tr>
