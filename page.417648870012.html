<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - This Jan. 15, 2015, file photo shows a view of the jury box, right, inside Courtroom 201, where jury selection in the trial of Aurora movie theater shootings defendant James Holmes was set to begin at the Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Three jurors in the Colorado theater shooting trial were dismissed Tuesday, June 9, 2015, amid concern they had been exposed to media coverage of the case and were discussing it among themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CENTENNIAL, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>(AP) - The judge in the Colorado theater shooting trial dismissed three jurors Tuesday after learning that one was exposed to news coverage of the case and discussed it with the others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. found the three women violated his orders to avoid outside information on James Holmes' death penalty trial and to not talk about the case with anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The first woman told Samour her husband called her and told her, on speakerphone, that the district attorney had sent a tweet during testimony, which had been in the news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The other two jurors sometimes socialized with the first juror on breaks, and they were dismissed because they likely overheard her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Samour and attorneys from both sides had concerns about whether the three jurors were being completely forthcoming about what they had heard and discussed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The judge refused a request to dismiss a fourth juror who informed him about the situation, saying she had been honest with the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And he also kept a fifth juror who said she heard the juror who got the phone call mention the word "mistrial" but didn't know what it was about.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A total of 21 jurors and alternates remain, with the trial more than halfway done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Last week, the judge scolded District Attorney George Brauchler for tweeting from the courtroom about a video that was shown to jurors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Brauchler told the judge it was an accident and apologized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The tweet and defense requests for mistrials were discussed while jurors were away from the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Jurors could know about them only from outside sources, such as social media or news reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to opening fire on a crowded theater in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He killed 12 people and injured 70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The judge was concerned that none of the other jurors came forward to report the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Under questioning from Samour, the first juror said she got the call from her husband during lunch last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She said the phone was on speaker at the time, and he asked her about Brauchler's tweet while another juror was sitting next to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The juror said she didn't ask what the tweet said and noted she and her husband argued because she knew she wasn't supposed to discuss the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>When asked why she didn't report the incident, she responded: "I just really don't pay attention to my husband most of the time. So it wasn't really important, at that time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The juror wiped away tears when Samour told her she was dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>During jury selection, the mother of three said she did not follow the news and said staying away from coverage about the trial would not be a problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A total of 24 jurors and alternates were seated in the case - a process that took nearly three months after 9,000 summonses were sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>None of them will know which 12 will decide the case until deliberations are about to begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>At that point, the remaining alternates will be dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The judge chose the large number of panelists so there would be plenty of alternates to replace anyone who has to be dismissed for health or other reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Jurors are allowed to go home every night, but they can't discuss the case with anyone or see or read anything about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>They are, however, allowed to use their phones on breaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>While being questioned Tuesday, some admitted they sometimes see headlines about the trial while online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Brauchler's tweet came shortly after the defense began cross-examining a state-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. William Reid, who conducted 22 hours of interviews with Holmes and concluded Holmes was sane at the time of the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Reid's testimony was interspersed video of his with interviews with Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The district attorney tweeted from courtroom: "I agree on the video. I hope the jury does too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Brauchler said he meant to send a text, not a tweet, and apologized to the judge.</td></tr>
