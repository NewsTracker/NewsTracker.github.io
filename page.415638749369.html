<h3>Protesters march against austerity measures in Madrid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sunday's vote in Andalusia, one of the poorest parts of the country, is seen as a test of the national mood ahead of Spain's most unpredictable general election in decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Bread, work, a roof and dignity" read a large banner as a group of demonstrators made their way through one of the richer areas of the capital before joining up with other protesters at the Plaza de Colon square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The demonstrators were voicing their discontent with the painful austerity policies that have led the government to make spending cuts to the tune of 150bn ($162bn) between 2012 and 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Education, public health, and social benefits have all been affected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Spain saw growth of 1.4% in 2014 but after an economic crisis that lasted six years, the economy remains battered with an unemployment rate of 23.7%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Half of all young people between the ages of 16 and 25 are without jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We have mobilised here for the young people because in Extremadura youth unemployment is almost 60%," said 28-year-old Antonio Laso who hails from the country's southwestern region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It is a day to claim our rights," said Antonio Colmenar, an activist with an anti-eviction organisation who said he had travelled from the Andalusian capital Seville to march in the rally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The 41-year-old had yet to decide whether he will on Sunday vote for the left-wing anti-austerity Podemos party or for Ciudadanos, a centre-right party which also rails against corruption and unemployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>These two upstarts are challenging the two-party system that has dominated Spanish politics for more than 30 years, with Podemos topping the latest opinion polls after riding a wave of popularity following the January election win of Greece's hard-left Syriza party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last year's inaugural "march for dignity" in Madrid descended into violence with dozens of protesters and police officers injured in clashes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Saturday's rally passed off peacefully although police said they had arrested 17 people for vandalism and public disorder.</td></tr>
