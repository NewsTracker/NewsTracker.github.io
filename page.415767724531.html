<h3>Airlines introduce two-person cockpit rule after Germanwings crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian aviation authorities are considering strengthening cockpit security rules following the Germanwings disaster, in which it's believed the pilot deliberately crashed the plane, killing all on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Transport Minister Warren Truss said on Friday authorities were reviewing information from the Germanwings crash, and aviation security and safety agencies were investigating if cockpit security and safety requirements needed to be strengthened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Regulations require the door must remain locked for the duration of the flight, except when necessary to allow a person to enter or leave the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Once an aircraft has taken off, entry to the cockpit must be authorised by the pilot in command.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The current regulations do not require airlines to replace a pilot who temporarily leaves the cockpit," Mr Truss said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Careful consideration needs to be made following thorough investigation to ensure that altering current procedures does not open other potential vulnerabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A more thorough review had been ordered to consider the findings of the investigation of the Germanwings crash, in which 150 people were killed when the A320 slammed into the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Australian review comes as airlines and aviation regulators around the world have begun taking steps to ensure there are always two people in the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Watch: How is it possible to keep someone out of a plane's cockpit?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>French prosecutors have said the most plausible explanation for the crash earlier this week was that the co-pilot locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately flew into the mountainside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The cockpit voice recorder, according to the Marseille public prosecutor Brice Robin, reveals the pilot's growing panic as the aircraft rapidly descends, but that his desperate pleas for Andreas Lubitz to open the door to the flight deck went unanswered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Qantas Group, which includes JetStar, said in a statement issued on Friday afternoon that it was also monitoring information coming out of the French investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have a comprehensive safety management system that guards against risks to our operations. This includes multi-layered systems to protect the flight deck on our aircraft," a Qantas Group spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>safeguards are needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The transport minister Warren Truss said Australia already had strict safety regulations to safeguard passengers and that the government's policy was to take a preventative, layered approach to aviation security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>To prevent hijacking of an aircraft, Aviation Transport Security Regulations require all aircraft used for regular passenger services to have a hardened cockpit door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The door must remain locked for the duration of the flight, except when necessary to allow a person to enter or leave the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But current regulations do not require airlines to replace a pilot who temporarily leaves the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Careful consideration needs to be made following thorough investigation to ensure that altering current procedures does not open other potential vulnerabilities," Mr Truss said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Our two major international and domestic airlines are undertaking their own safety and security risk assessments of cockpit procedures following the recent tragedy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Other countries have already moved to implement changes to cockpit rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>planes' cockpits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Air New Zealand on Friday said it was implementing changes to its cockpit procedures, effective immediately, to ensure at least two crew members would be on the flight deck at all times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Germany's aviation association BDL has also announced it plans to introduce a two-person cockpit rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Virgin Australia said it continuously undertook detailed risk reviews, and consulted with the relevant regulatory and industry bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Any updates regarding changes to our processes will be provided where appropriate," the airline said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Virgin's pilots underwent regular aeromedical exams, which included mental health assessment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The apparent actions of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz have raised questions about the security protocols for pilots and crew on board commercial airliners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Airlines rushed to change rules on Thursday to require a second crew member in the cockpit at all times, hours after French prosecutors suggested a co-pilot who barricaded himself alone at the controls of a jetliner had crashed it on purpose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The United States already requires two crew members to be in the cabin at all times, but many other countries do not, allowing pilots to leave the flight deck, for example to use the toilet, as long as one pilot is at the controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That is precisely what French prosecutors suspect happened on the Germanwings flight on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>They say Andreas Lubitz, 27, locked the captain out and appears to have set the controls to crash into a mountain, killing all 150 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Airlines including Norwegian Air Shuttle, Britain's easyJet, Air Canada and Air Berlin all said within hours that they had introduced a requirement that two crew members be in the cockpit at all times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Canada said it would immediately impose such a rule on all its airlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"We had a lot of concerned customers," an Air Berlin spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Airlines including Ryanair that already had such rules in place rushed to reassure customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Among the companies that did not announce such a policy change was Germanwings parent Lufthansa, whose CEO Carsten Spohr said he believed it was unnecessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"I don't see any need to change our procedures here," Spohr told journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"It was a one-off case. But we will look at it with the various experts at Lufthansa and the authorities. We shouldn't lose ourselves in short-term measures."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>His comments drew criticism on Twitter, with some people demanding the airline introduce the two person-rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>This is an undated image taken from Facebook of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz in San Francisco California.</td></tr>
