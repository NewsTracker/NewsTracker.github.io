<h3>European shares fall amid Greek impasse, weak euro zone data</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LONDON, May 29 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday, setting them on course for a weekly loss, as investors were unnerved by conflicting signals from Greece's debt talks and data showing private loan growth in the euro zone stalled last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Athens' benchmark share index fell 0.5 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 shed 0.7 percent to 1,603.86 points by 1023 GMT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The FTSEurofirst is down 0.9 percent so far in a week that has been marked by uncertainty surrounding Greece's negotiations with its international lenders ahead of a payment deadline for Athens looming next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The index is still up around 1.8 percent for the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece's government intends to reach an agreement on a cash-for-reforms deal by Sunday, its spokesman said on Thursday, even as euro zone officials suggested a deal was far from imminent and the head of the International Monetary Fund was quoted as saying the country could leave the currency bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The lack of clarity on the outcome meant some traders were reluctant to make strong bets on future market directions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's just Greece, Greece and Greece," David Madden, a market analyst at IG, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The lack of news in either direction tells you why traders are sitting on their hands."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>European indexes extended losses after data showed euro zone private sector loans stopped rising in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The lending data shows a lack of risk attitude among businesses," said Brenda Kelly, head analyst at London Capital Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Associated British Foods was the biggest gainer on the pan-European index, adding 2.4 percent to reach two-month highs after Goldman Sachs ramped up its rating to "buy" from "sell".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mergers & acquisition speculation boosted Swiss agrochemicals company Syngenta, which was building up defenses for a possible higher bid from U.S. peer Monsanto , according to a Bloomberg report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Syngenta shares were up 1.1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Swedish builder Skanska rose 0.8 percent after it said its LaGuardia Gateway Partners consortium had been selected as preferred bidder in a $3.6 billion project to build a new terminal at New York's LaGuardia Airport.</td></tr>
