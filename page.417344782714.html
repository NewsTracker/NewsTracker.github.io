<h3>Defiant Soccer Chief Resists Calls to Resign Amid Scandal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As defiant as ever, Sepp Blatter resisted calls to resign as FIFA president Thursday and deflected blame for the massive bribery and corruption scandal engulfing soccer's world governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We, or I, cannot monitor everyone all of the time," Blatter said in his first public remarks on the crisis that has further tainted his leadership on the eve of his bid for a fifth term as president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 79-year-old Blatter insisted he could restore trust in world soccer after a pair of corruption investigations brought "shame and humiliation" on his organization and the world's most popular sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We cannot allow the reputation of football and FIFA to be dragged through the mud any longer," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It has to stop here and now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Despite a tide of criticism and pressure on him to leave, Blatter is moving ahead with a presidential election Friday that is likely to bring him another four years in office as one of them most powerful men in sports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The events of yesterday have cast a long shadow over football," he said, his voice shaky at times, in a speech to open FIFA's two-day congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"There can be no place for corruption of any kind."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Blatter refused to back down after European soccer body UEFA demanded earlier Thursday that he quit following the latest - and most serious allegations - to discredit FIFA during his 17 years in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Enough is enough," UEFA President Michel Platini said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"People no longer want him anymore and I don't want him anymore either."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Platini met privately with Blatter and asked him to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I am asking you to leave FIFA, to step down because you are giving FIFA a terrible image," Platini said he told Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"In terms of our image, it is not good at all and I am the first one to be disgusted by this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Blatter, who is expected to win Friday's election against Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, is coming under increasing scrutiny amid U.S. and Swiss federal investigations into high-level corruption tearing at FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A U.S. Justice Department investigation accused 14 international soccer officials or sports marketing executives of bribery, racketeering, fraud and money-laundering over two decades in connection with marketing rights worth hundreds of millions of dollars awarded for tournaments in North and South America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Seven officials - including two FIFA vice presidents and members of its finance committee - remained in custody in Zurich on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Blatter was not implicated in the indictment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In addition, Swiss officials are investigating the FIFA votes that sent the World Cup tournament to Russia in 2018 and to Qatar in 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Both decisions were marred by allegations of wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>One of FIFA's major sponsors, Visa, warned Thursday that it could pull out of its contract, which is worth at least $25 million a year through 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Visa urged FIFA "to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organization."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>While acknowledging that many people hold him responsible for FIFA's tattered image, Blatter blamed the "actions of individuals" for harming the organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"If people want to do wrong, they will also try to hide it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I will not allow the actions of a few to destroy the hard work and integrity of the vast majority of those who work so hard for football."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Blatter said the crisis could mark a "turning point" for FIFA to clean itself up.</td></tr>
