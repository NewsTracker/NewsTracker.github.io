<h3>Why Tourism Advertising is More Powerful Than You Think</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He and his firm Longwoods International have been tracking the performance of the advertising campaigns of countries, states and cities for over 25 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>So when he called me up and said, "Can we get together? I've got some really interesting numbers to share with you," I readily agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bill had a simple question he wanted to answer: Is there a halo effect generated by tourism advertising?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Yes, we can survey consumers and directly see how a state or city's advertising campaign works in influencing perceptions of a destination's tourism product and ultimately in motivating travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But are there other benefits in boosting the community's overall image with the same audience?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>North Dakota is a case in point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>For the past decade, the state's "Legendary" campaign has been a successful branding statement connecting the state to potential travelers in an emotional and authentic manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The most recent ROI research shows that North Dakota's U.S. campaign generated over $100 in visitor spending for every dollar spent on advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>North Dakota's "Legendary" advertising campaign kicked-off in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tourism advertising helped boost the state's image in unexpected ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Longwoods asked the same six questions in assessing the impact of advertising campaigns for a number of other states, including North Carolina, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The findings couldn't have been more consistent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In each and every case, effective tourism advertising had the same impact, improving consumer perceptions of each state in accidental yet positive ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And while tourism marketing has been shown to generate significant economic impact by driving visitation, these results demonstrate the potential long-term benefits for broader economic development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Edward Thorndike, an early educational psychologist, first coined the term "the halo effect" in a 1920 article titled "A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Thorndike asked two commanding officers to evaluate their soldiers in terms of physical qualities (neatness, voice, physique, bearing, and energy) and personal qualities (including dependability, loyalty, responsibility, selflessness, and cooperation).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He found that if an officer liked one aspect of the soldier, he tended to have a positive predisposition toward everything about him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nearly one hundred years later, the same can now be said of tourism advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We've known for a long time that effective tourism advertising campaigns build positive feelings toward a travel experience and inspire travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But thanks to Bill Siegel and the Longwoods team, we now know that the same campaigns have other benefits that elevate impressions of a destination in an unintended yet positive manner.</td></tr>
