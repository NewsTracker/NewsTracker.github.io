<h3>Putin says Nemtsov assassination a 'disgrace'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Russian president Vladimir Putin has described the killing of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov as a tragedy that has brought disgrace on Russia, and warned against a rise in "extremist crime".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We must pay the greatest attention to crimes that prompt a major reaction, including those that are politically charged," he told interior ministry officials at a televised meeting on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We must rid Russia of disgrace and tragedies like the one we just saw... the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Nemtsov, a longtime Putin critic and anti-corruption crusader, was gunned down near the Kremlin on Friday night in an attack that sent shockwaves through the Russian opposition and the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Putin has previously described Mr Nemtsov's murder as a "provocation" and vowed that everything would be done to bring to justice those who committed a "vile and cynical murder".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Investigators have said they are examining possible motives for the murder, including Mr Nemtsov's opposition to Russian military actions in Ukraine and a link to his condemnation of the attack against the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly in Paris in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Putin also warned against a rise in "extremist crime", without directly linking it to Mr Nemtsov's murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Extremists poison society with militant nationalism, intolerance and aggression," he said, adding that unrest in Ukraine was a consequence of such extremism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's important to react instantly to any signs of extremist action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Kremlin has denied any involvement, saying that the killing was a "provocation" designed to discredit Mr Putin and strengthen his opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But Mr Nemtsov's friends say the Kremlin is to blame for fomenting an atmosphere of hatred towards its opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Who was Boris Nemtsov?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Look back at the career of Boris Nemtsov who served as a deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin before becoming one of the most prominent opponents of Russian president Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier on Wednesday, the director of Russia's federal security service said that an investigation had identified several suspects, without giving details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Russian news agencies reported that investigators were seeking a car in connection to the killing that may be connected to the finance ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters that the car, a Ford, did not belong to the ministry itself but was owned by a state enterprise responsible for providing security to government institutions, including the finance ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The vehicle drove past the spot where Mr Nemtsov was shot after the killing and when police patrol cars had already arrived at the scene, the statement said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Lake Bled - Castle Bled offers a more traditional view of Slovenia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Legend says that a husband who can carry his bride all 99 paces from the dock to the church is assured a happy marriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Skofja Loka - This year, 640 actors will perform "Skofja Loka Passion Play," the oldest Slovene drama ever written.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Maribor - The Old Vine in Maribor is said to be the world's oldest living grapevine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Triglav - As Slovenia's highest peak, the 2,864-meter Triglav remains a potent symbol of national identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sentrupert - Where else can you find a museum dedicated to ornate hay racks?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>(CNN)Slovenia's star is rising in 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The lakes and meadowlands of this small central European country have long been under-visited, but this year's anniversaries and cultural events are luring more travelers than ever before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The capital city Ljubljana is toasting a double anniversary: two millennia since its foundation and 120 years of renewal after a huge earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A rare performance of Slovenia's oldest literary work will bring drama to the town of Skofja Loka, while carnivals and wine festivities unfold in Ptuj and Maribor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This rich calendar, as well as the timelessly beautiful landscapes, makes Slovenia almost unmissable in 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At about 300,000 inhabitants, Ljubljana is small for a capital city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But its history is epic: Ljubljana is celebrating 2,000 years since its foundation as a Roman city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This year sees an additional anniversary, as locals toast 120 years of reinvention since Ljubljana was rocked by a huge earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The 1895 tremors destroyed 10% of the city's buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>During its rebuilding, the Vienna Secession period brought new architectural styles to this baroque city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Modern Ljubljana is beautiful enough to rival Vienna or Prague.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Its geranium-pink Franciscan Church in Preseren Square overlooks the interlacing Triple Bridge, with a backdrop of the Julian Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But Ljubljana's dragon emblem truly sets it apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Some folklore links the dragon to a monster subdued by Jason and the Argonauts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A more likely source is the dragon-slaying Saint George, patron of Ljubljana Castle's chapel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>These fire-breathing beasts glower from Dragon Bridge, adorn the city's coat of arms and top the castle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Saint George also points his lance in the northeasterly city of Ptuj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Near the entrance to the saint's namesake church there is a 14th-century statue of the saint slaying the dragon, which represents paganism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>So it's intriguing to see the strong pagan influence of Kurentovanje, a Shrove carnival and Slovenia's most popular springtime folklore event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In the days before Shrove Tuesday, locals clad in sheepskin, masks and grotesque prosthetic tongues symbolically scare away winter by processing through Ptuj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Children dive out of the way of a devil with a soul-catching net who leads the procession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>When the remarkable creatures of Postojna Caves were first recorded in the 17th century, locals called them baby dragons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Today, we know them as proteus, ghostly pale amphibians native only to this region of Slovenia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In Postojna, they're a huge tourism draw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>An underground train takes visitors through caverns dripping with stalactites to a vivarium full of these strange animals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Scientists are discovering that the proteus is more bizarre than any creature of myth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The proteus can survive without food for eight to 10 years, and live for up to a century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>They're blind, navigating via light-sensitive receptors and by perceiving weak electrical fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"Although proteus may be one of the best-researched cave animals, it still holds many secrets," say Dr. Liljana Bizjak Mali and Dr. Boris Bulog of the University of Ljubljana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"We do not yet know if proteus can regenerate like other salamanders, but if they do we could learn much about stem cells, tissue repair and perhaps even cancer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Just 15 kilometers shy of Slovenia's border with Austria, the Julian Alps and miles of forest halt abruptly for Lake Bled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>This small alpine lake, overlooked by a towering Romanesque castle, is startling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The lake's bright jade waters lap against dainty Bled Island (Blejski otok).</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Its most prominent building is the 17th-century Church of the Assumption, which is steeped in romantic tradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>According to regional lore, a happy marriage is assured to a husband who can carry his bride all 99 paces from the dock into the church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Some 55 wedding ceremonies took place in the island church last year, with many more couples visiting to toll its "wishing bell."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Boat rentals ply the lake for much of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Summer visitors can just as easily swim to the island -- thermal springs keep the water a toasty 26 C (79 F).</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Come winter, when the trees are dusted with snow, ice skaters swirl around the frozen surface of the lake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>In 2015, visitors to Skofja Loka have a rare chance to experience Slovenia's vibrant literary history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The medieval town is home to the oldest complete dramatic text ever written in the Slovene language, the Skofja Loka Passion Play (Skofjeloski pasijon).</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The original manuscript is closely guarded by the local monastery and only irregularly performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>This year 32,000 visitors are expected to watch a cast of 640 actors bring the play to life as a procession around multiple locations in the medieval town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"Local involvement is intense," says the play's project manager Matej Mohoric Peternelj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"We call it the Passion spirit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Performances will take place in the town from March 21 to April 12, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Tickets can be booked at pasijon.si.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Mercury and lace seem to bear little relation, but in Idrija they're cornerstones of local tradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Mercury mines brought Idrija wealth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>They're the reason for Idrija's spot on UNESCO's World Heritage list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>But it's the centuries-old tradition of lace making that's given area a thriving new voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>More than 400 children and 150 adult students have come to try their hand at crafting intricate bobbin lace in Idrija over the past half-decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Today, visitors are as likely to buy lace-embellished garters and jeans as more traditional souvenirs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>"Fashion was, and still is, important for lace making," says Metka Fortuna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>With 12 years as a lace-making teacher and now a head of the Idrija Lace School for nine years, Fortuna has watched the development of this intricate craft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>"Older lace makers now cooperate with students to create products interesting for younger generations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>You can experience both sides of Idrija's local pride with a descent of Anthony's Shaft and a visit to the lace making school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Slovenia's second largest city acquired polish as 2012's European Capital of Culture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>But Maribor's enduring attraction dangles at the end of a vine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>The Old Vine in Maribor's Lent neighborhood is said to be the world's oldest living grapevine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Maribor grew to prominence through a wine-growing trade that began in the Middle Ages, with a flourishing Jewish community at its heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>One famous vine has lasted throughout Maribor's vinicultural history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Wine pressed from the fruit of this 400-year-old vine is gifted to dignitaries as a symbolic key to Maribor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>A ceremony adds pomp to the harvesting of the vine annually in early October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Year-round, the Old Vine House welcomes visitors to savor wine and history in equal measure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Triglav National Park in Slovenia's northwest covers nearly 3% of the country's area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Two million visitors arrive annually to hike around Bohinj, Slovenia's largest glacial lake, and to waterfalls like 78-meter-high Savica.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>The crowning attraction is Mount Triglav.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>This 2,864-meter mountain in Slovenia's only national park is a recurring motif in Slovene art, film and music, and a cherished emblem of national identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>As Slovenia's highest point, Mount Triglav remains a symbolic lightning rod for national identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>It's from Triglav's summit that the Slovene flag was unfurled at the country's 1991 independence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>The country's former president, Milan Kucan, even declared climbing the mountain a duty for every Slovene national.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>There are trails around Triglav National Park to suit all abilities, but long hikes should only be undertaken with experienced guides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>The Slovenian kozolec has grown from being a simple agrarian tool into a symbol of national pride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Visitors are sometimes bemused by the local fondness for the kozolec, a distinctive hay rack found throughout Slovenia's meadowlands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>In 2013 a dedicated open-air museum in Sentrupert began to showcase the kozolec and its history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>To most local people they're much more than a farming tool: they're a tangible reminder of expert craftsmanship, eliciting powerful nostalgia for Slovenia's past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>Squeezed between Italy and Croatia, Slovene Istria has the vibe of the Italian Riviera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>The star attraction of this 43-kilometer stretch of coast is Piran, a grand coral-roofed city lapped by the Adriatic's navy blue waters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>Here in Slovenia's most southwesterly tip, Italian and Slovene are both official languages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Istria is known for rich olive oils and sweet Malvasia wine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>Italian flavors come through in pastas and risottos scattered with shellfish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Croatian staples are also popular, such as octopus salads and gulas (stew).</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>In this same region, salt is panned from the Mediterranean's most northerly salt flats in Secovlje in a method unchanged for seven centuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>As in so many places in Slovenia, tradition reigns supreme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Midsummer brings most of Piran's visitors, but shoulder season (April-May and September-October) has lovely weather without crowds.</td></tr>
