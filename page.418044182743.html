<h3>Sport24.co.za | 1000s sign up for Blatter's 'leaving party'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sepp Blatter is expected to be re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Zurich - A celebration of Sepp Blatter's departure as the head of world soccer's governing body has attracted more than 21,000 would-be guests via Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With FIFA mired in a corruption scandal, Blatter, 79, delighted critics this month by announcing he would stand down as president of the governing body and call a leadership election, due between December and February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We've been waiting for this moment for years! You're all invited to the headquarters of FIFA in Zurich! Give the man a good send-off!" wrote Dutch soccer fan Rodney Bouwhuizen, who has created the December 1 event with the Facebook page "Leaving Party for Sepp Blatter".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>So far, just over 21,000 people are down on the social networking site as "going", although there is no guarantee that many will attend, or that the event will even take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>FIFA, which Blatter has led since 1998, said it had no comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Blatter has not been charged with any wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A spokesman for Zurich police said they were aware of the planned party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"First of all we will try to get in touch with the organiser," the spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Often people aren't aware what they bring about with an event like this and then also withdraw the invitation."</td></tr>
