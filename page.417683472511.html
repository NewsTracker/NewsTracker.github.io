<h3>Educated Ukrainians flee east Ukraine for new lives in Kiev</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this May 13, 2015, photo, Alesya Bolot gestures during an interview in Kiev, Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bolot worked for a contemporary arts foundation that converted an abandoned factory into a mecca for young and bright people with daring ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She arrived in the capital Kiev a year ago with only a backpack, not planning a long-term stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But she decided to remain after she was told she was on the wanted list of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic, for alleged subversive activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Alesya Bolot worked for a contemporary arts foundation that converted an abandoned factory into a mecca for young and bright people with daring ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Vibrant and cosmopolitan, the 27-year-old would not look out of place in a gallery in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She was at the forefront of the avant-garde arts scene in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk when a pro-Russian insurgency took over and upended her life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When a rebel-controlled local television station portrayed creative people like her as the enemy, she decided it was time to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bolot arrived in the capital Kiev a year ago with only a backpack, not planning a long-term stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>More than 2.2 million people have fled their homes in eastern Ukraine since the war between government forces and Russia-backed separatists began in April last year, according to the United Nations, some to neighboring Russia, but about 1.3 million to Ukrainian regions under government control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Educated, middle-class people like Bolot, whose arts center was turned into a rebel training camp and prison, represent a big chunk of those who opt for Ukraine-controlled areas, especially the capital - a serious brain drain for Ukraine's east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There are so many of them in Kiev, the displaced say, that it often feels like their city has moved with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>According to the U.N., a total of 94,000 people from eastern Ukraine are now living in Kiev and its suburbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>More than 8,000 are subscribed to a "Donetsk people in Kiev" group on Facebook, set up by Vladimir Voronov, a 36-year old who created the brand for the glittering new Donetsk airport, which was transformed into an apocalyptic wasteland by months of heavy fighting there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For people who have left their careers, homes and often extended families behind, community outreach is vital for survival, Voronov says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Along with the war trauma, he explains, people from the east have to struggle with the dire financial realities of a recession, with the government offering a paltry 400 hryvnias ($20) a month in benefits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Because of the need to survive many people here have discovered new resources in them," Voronov says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's a seasoned community that has nothing to lose, has nowhere to go back to, all bridges burnt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Voronov's friend and business partner, Andrei Budyak, runs the informal Donetsk community in Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He says the community is helping newcomers to integrate, offering legal advice as well as a chance to simply "meet and chat, to have a good time to reminisce about the good old days."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The community trades advice, organizes picnics and offers free classes for children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The displaced long to return home but are afraid that the war has changed their homeland beyond recognition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some feel betrayed by those who stayed, regarding them as supporting the separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Bolot says she is certain that many people who stayed in Donetsk do not share the separatists' views - but still finds reconciliation difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I don't know how you can live and work alongside people who have supported what is going on there," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The population of Donetsk, the rebel region's largest city, is believed to have shrunk by a third from its pre-war 1 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A city that hosted the Euro 2012 football matches, with glittering store fronts and a vibrant restaurant scene, Donetsk is now eerily empty during what could be the rush hour, as if it's always a lazy Sunday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The exodus has drained the region of countless professionals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Viktoria Sosnina, a gynecologist from Donetsk who fled to Kiev, says roughly half the doctors at her once-prestigious hospital have left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>And so have many patients.</td></tr>
