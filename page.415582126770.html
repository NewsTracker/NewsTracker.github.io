<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GADSDEN, Ala.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - Closing arguments are set in the capital murder trial of an Alabama woman accused of making her granddaughter run until she died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A judge told jurors to return to court Friday morning so prosecutors and defense lawyers could sum up the case of 49-year-old Joyce Hardin Garrard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Garrard was the last witness, denying she meant to harm 9-year-old Savannah Hardin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Garrard says she made the girl pick up sticks after telling a lie, and she claims she was coaching the girl on running to improve her performance in races at school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But prosecutors say Garrard actually made the girl run for hours as punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They cite a surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jury deliberations will start after closing arguments.</td></tr>
