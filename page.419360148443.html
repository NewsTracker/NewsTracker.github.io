<h3>Tebow runs for a score, Eagles beat Colts 36-10 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Tim Tebow got a warm Philly welcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tebow threw for 69 yards and ran for a touchdown in his first game in two years, Kenjon Barner returned a punt 92 yards for a touchdown and ran for a score and the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Indianapolis Colts 36-10 Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tebow got a standing ovation when he entered midway through the third quarter and the crowd roared so loud when his name was introduced he had to quiet them down because he was taking the snap in a shotgun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It's very humbling, a blessing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>I appreciated it,'' Tebow said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tebow completed his first four passes and fans chanted ''Tebow!</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tebow!'' during his first series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He dove into the pylon on a 7-yard TD run late in the fourth quarter and finished with 15 yards rushing on four carries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He completed 6 of 12 passes and was sacked twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''I liked how Timmy threw it,'' Eagles coach Chip Kelly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tebow hadn't played since the 2013 preseason with New England until the Eagles (1-0) signed him to compete with Matt Barkley for the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>3 spot behind Sam Bradford and Mark Sanchez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Barkley was 12 of 20 for 192 yards and one interception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''Did some things decent and some things we have to work on,'' Tebow said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Quarterback Andrew Luck was 5 of 6 for 43 yards for the Colts (0-1).</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Playing their first game since losing to the Patriots in the AFC championship game that began the Deflategate saga, the Colts didn't seem as if they prepared much for Philadelphia's up-tempo offense and they were missing several defensive starters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But making sure players get reps is more important than scheming for a unique offense they're not going to see in the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Several Colts starters didn't play, including WR T.Y. Hilton, RB Frank Gore and CB Vontae Davis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Eagles were missing LBs DeMeco Ryans, Kiko Alonso and Mychal Kendricks along with Bradford and All-Pro running back DeMarco Murray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Colts: WR Phillip Dorsett had four catches for 51 yards, but lost a fumble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>RB Josh Robinson ran for 44 yards and one TD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Eagles: WR Nelson Agholor had three catches for 57 yards, including a 39-yard TD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He leaped to make the catch, spun around a defender and sprinted into the end zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>CB Eric Rowe forced a fumble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Colts: Matt Hasselbeck was 8 of 17 for 72 yards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Bryan Bennett was 4 of 16 for 35 yards and two interceptions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Eagles: Sanchez was 2 for 7 for 52 yards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He underthrew a wide-open Trey Burton on Philadelphia's first play from scrimmage and later overthrew Jordan Matthews on what would've been a TD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Colts RG Todd Herremans and LB Trent Cole returned to Philadelphia for the first time since they were released after playing 10 seasons for the Eagles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Both received a standing ovation when shown on the video screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>One fan carried a sign that read: ''Welcome back to Philly, Frank Gore.'' Gore had agreed to sign with the Eagles in free agency only to change his mind a day later and go to Indianapolis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Colts: WR Andre Johnson had one catch for 9 yards in the seven-time Pro Bowl pick's first game since leaving Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Eagles: WR Miles Austin had two catches for 41 yards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>RB Ryan Mathews had 18 yards rushing on two carries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Colts rookie CB D'Joun Smith sustained a concussion in the first half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Eagles LB Marcus Smith, a first-round pick who barely played last year, made his presence felt in the first quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In one series, he helped stuff a run, got his hand in the QB's face and forced an incompletion with solid coverage on a tight end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Eagles Pro Bowl K Cody Parkey missed one extra point and one field goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''Let's not hit the panic button,'' Kelly said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Sanchez looked like Michael Vick, eluding a sack and scrambling for 10 yards on third-and-5 to keep Philadelphia's first TD drive going.</td></tr>
