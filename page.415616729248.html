<tr><td>27</td><td>"We had to spend the first three days trying to get some form of coordination in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A woman looks on amongst the ruins of her home on the remote south-west coast of Tanna Island , Vanuatu.</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>"There are lots of book warehouses out there, you know in the western world books are going out of fashion, you can't sell your second-hand books, you can't get rid of them. Well, we need good books, good encyclopedias, reference books, all subjects, reading books." said Port Vila Central School headmaster Paul Alexander Hetyey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Australia's Medical Assistance Team is now set up at the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"This is still an unfolding story," AusMAT's Matthew Harper told SBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"We're seeing a fairly low casualty rate, we seeing trauma usually associated with cyclones, so blunt object injuries and broken bones."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Almost a week after the cyclone, relief missions are just now beginning to reach Vanuatu's devastated outer Islands.</td></tr>

<tr><td>63</td><td>Meanwhile, remote parts of Tafea province, like the islands of Futuna and Aniwa, are still to make contact with anyone, raising fears about how communities there coped with the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>The southern side of Tanna is also a black spot, with no assessment teams yet to reach the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Many UN and aid group officials arrived on Wednesday morning to help, but say it's almost impossible to direct aid before a full assessment is made.</td></tr>
