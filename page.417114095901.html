<h3>Facebook's Internet.org criticised as it 'violates principles of free speech'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It was launched as a positive initiative designed to connect the two thirds of people around the globe who are offline to the web.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Facebook's Internet.org scheme has suffered a substantial backlash from worldwide organisations who claim it violates the principles of net neutrality, freedom of expression, privacy and security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In an open letter to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, 67 institutions have explained their reservations about the scheme and have called on him to address their concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>These institutions and organisations include the Media Alliance in the US, Digital Rights Foundation in Pakistan, the EU's European Digital Rights and the global OpenMedia group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It reads: 'We share a common concern about the launch and expansion of Facebook's Internet.org platform and its implications for the open Internet around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'It is our belief that Facebook is improperly defining net neutrality in public statements and building a walled garden in which the world's poorest people will only be able to access a limited set of insecure websites and services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'We support the goal of bringing affordable internet access to the two-thirds of the world who currently lack it [and] we have always sought to provide non-discriminatory access to the full open internet, without privileging certain applications or services over others and without compromising the privacy and security of users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Internet.org launched in August 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is led by Facebook but is a collaboration between large technology companies including handset makers Nokia and Samsung, telecom giant Ericsson, and chip designer Qualcomm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The project was set up to connect two thirds of people globally who are offline and, in five to 10 years, it hopes to reduce the cost of providing mobile internet by 99 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Under the scheme, a selection of web services are made available to people - many in developing countries - to introduce them to how the web works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It is not designed to offer the entire web for free to everyone and is instead a stepping stone for people to see the benefits of being online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Once they have, those who can afford to buy a data plan will be able to from their country's existing mobile operators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>As a result, Facebook has been criticised for limiting which sites and services are offered, and therefore prioritised, in these regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A Facebook spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We and our critics share a common vision of helping more people gain access to the broadest possible range of experiences and services on the internet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'We are convinced that as more and more people gain access to the internet, they will see the benefits and want to use even more services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It isn't the first time the project has faced such criticism, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Earlier this month a number of news organisations in India announced they would withdraw from the program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They too claimed it violated the spirit of 'net neutrality', defined by the equal treatment for all services online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Facebook responded by saying Internet.org would operate as a free platform 'so anyone can build free basic services,' but that the full Internet would not be included.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Zuckerberg said the goal remains to give people a limited number of basic services for health, education and jobs, for example, arguing this is not in conflict with net neutrality principles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But he noted that access is offered as a partnership with local mobile operators, which agreed to offer certain services for free with an option to get the full Internet with a paid subscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'It's not sustainable to offer the whole Internet for free,' he continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In the recent open letter, the groups complained that Internet.org will endanger the security of users by not using HTTPS encryption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>This was also recently been addressed by Mr Zuckerberg when he said: 'We're going to support HTTPS and SSL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Elsewhere, the letter criticises Facebook's 'zero-rating' policy within Internet.org.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Zero rating is the practice by service providers of offering their customers a specific set of services or applications that are free to use without a data plan, or that do not count against existing data caps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It has been criticised for being 'inherently discriminatory' and is restricted in countries such as Canada, The Netherlands, Slovenia and Chile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The letter continued: 'Facebook is partnering with ISPs around the world to offer access to certain internet applications to users at no cost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Quartz commissioned Geopoll to survey a total of 1,000 people - 500 in each country - across Indonesia and Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In Indonesia, 37 per cent of the respondents were female and 63 per cent were male.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Ages were divided into three groups: 15 to 24-year-olds (37 per cent), 25 to 34-year-olds (39 per cent) and 35 and over (24 per cent).</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In Nigeria, the gender split was 47 per cent female and 53 per cent male.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The majority were in the lower age category (56 per cent), just over a third (34 per cent) were between 25 and 34, and one in 10 were 35 and older.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The surveys took place in December and were conducted over text message, so specifically targeted phone users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Quartz additionally commissioned surveys in India, Brazil and Indonesia using Jana, and studied Americans online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>On its 'Myths and facts' page, Facebook addressed the 'zero rating' claims and explained that it does not pay operators for the data that people consume.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It partners with them on the technical side and provides marketing support only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>But this doesn't categorically address the claims about endangering freedom of expression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>And in terms of Facebook 'wanting to keep people within a "walled garden" of free content,' the site said: 'Operators can't afford to invest in improving their infrastructure if new users never pay for data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>One criticism that isn't specifically mentioned in the open letter but has been raised in the past is that many people think Facebook is the entire internet, and that the site is trying to use Internet.org to reinforce that impression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>This stemmed from two studies, commissioned by Quartz, that studied how people perceive the concept of the web.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>When asked if they have the internet, and whether they use Facebook, people in Indonesia and Nigeria didn't make the connection between the two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>In fact, one in 10 users in both regions denied having access to the web, but said they use Facebook daily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Helani Galpaya at the think tank spotted a pattern of negative answers to questions about the web during qualitative interviews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>This suggested those asked weren't web users, but the same people also admitted to using Facebook on their mobile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>During these interviews, in Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand more people said they were Facebook users than internet users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>More than one in 10 Indonesians said they use Facebook, but not the internet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>A separate study from Flurry Analytics recently spotted a trend of people shifting away from the web browser in favour of apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>During 2014, 86 per cent of people used apps to access web services, compared to just 14 per cent who used a mobile browser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Gaming apps led the way on 32 per cent, and Facebook increased its share from 24 per cent to 28 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>But Facebook addressed these criticisms by saying: 'Internet.org introduces people to the value of the entire internet through a set of free basic services that total over 100 globally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>'Giving people a list that features a broader set of services is important for helping people experience the value of other online services, like women's health information and education services.</td></tr>
