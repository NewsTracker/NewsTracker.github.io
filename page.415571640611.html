<h3>Erroneous LAPD handwriting analysis set back Robert Durst probe, warrant claims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was arrested in New Orleans over the weekend and charged with murder in California for the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Durst's arrest came shortly before the finale of an HBO series about his links to three killings - that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose chopped up body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Authorities on Tuesday searched Durst's Houston home, and the warrant released Wednesday details the timeline of the Berman case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It shows that police focused in on Durst's handwriting early on after a note received by police tipped them to Berman's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The envelope and note, written in block letters, misspelled "Beverley Hills Police" and included the word "cadaver" along with Berman's Beverly Hills address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In 2001, Los Angeles Police Department document examiner William Leaver concluded it was "highly probable" that the envelope and note were written by Nyle Brenner, Berman's manager and friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The assessment was "rubber stamped" by Leaver's supervisor, who told detectives this past September that she had not performed her own technical review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Investigators had not initially analyzed examples of Durst's handwriting, and it wasn't until eight months later that a comparison was made to Durst's limited sample writings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Leaver said "similarities" were enough to request more exemplar writings, which police eventually obtained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In June 2003, Leaver concluded the handwriting was likely Durst's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>By then, Durst had been charged in Texas with murder for the death and dismemberment of Morris Black.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The conflicting assessments meant valuable time lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Eventually, the envelope, letter and writing samples were sent to the California Department of Justice and an investigator determined Durst as "probably the author of the cadaver letter and note."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Los Angeles case went dormant and wasn't revived until 2012, when law enforcement learned of the HBO documentary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The filmmakers say they shared tape with police months ago of interviews with Durst, including his reactions to handwriting analysis and what appears to be a confession to Berman's killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In October and November, the LAPD had two independent examiners analyze the documents and both concluded Durst was the author.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The LAPD has declined comment until Durst is in its custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He's being held in Louisiana on gun charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said the conflicting determinations on the handwriting "shows you what junk science really is."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He also questioned what evidence police expected to find in Durst's Houston home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Durst himself may have pointed to the home, in a recording made while talking to himself after a tense interview with the makers of the six-part HBO documentary "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst," which concluded Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Just before saying he "killed them all," he says, "I don't know what's in the house!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The search warrant affidavit showed authorities were concerned Durst, who has an estimated net worth of $100 million, might be preparing to flee the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He had withdrawn large sums of money from multiple bank accounts, including daily amounts of $9,000 for 35 days starting in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Durst was under FBI surveillance, and agents arrested him in a New Orleans hotel under the name "Everette Ward," finding nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his room, the affidavit says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press Wednesday that it was a kind of "old man mask" and investigators were looking at whether he had been using it to travel around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Durst could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Berman.</td></tr>
