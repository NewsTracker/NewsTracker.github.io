<tr><td>10</td><td>He said the PKK was still assessing the damage caused by the strikes, though they didn't appear to cause casualties.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>It said five areas were targeted, including the Qandil mountains, where the PKK's command is based.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The statement did not specify Islamic State targets that were struck in Syria in a second night of bombings, but described the airstrikes in both Syria and Iraq as being "effective."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hiwa said the jets struck villages on Qandil although the PKK base was not hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Turkey's military also shelled Islamic State and PKK positions in Syria from across the Turkish border, the government said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It vowed to press ahead with operations against the PKK and IS, saying it was "determined to take all steps to ensure peace and security for our people."</td></tr>
