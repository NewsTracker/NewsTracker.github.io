<h3>Google Founder Defends Accident Records of Self-Driving Cars</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google co-founder Sergey Brin says the Internet company isn't releasing the accident reports involving its self-driving cars to protect the privacy of the other motorists in the crashes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Brin's explanation came in response to a question posed Wednesday by a company critic during Google's annual shareholders meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Even if names were censored from the records, Brin says the documents filed with California regulators wouldn't reveal anything different from what Google previously disclosed about the self-driving cars' collisions in a summary posted online three weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Brin says the total number of accidents climbed to 12 within the past week when a self-driving car was rear-ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google says its self-driving cars have never been at fault, though in one accident a company employee controlling the car hit another vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This story has been corrected to clarify that Google says a company employee was in control of a self-driving in the only accident caused by one of the vehicles.</td></tr>
