<tr><td>2</td><td>Uploading the image on his Twitter account, Liam, 21, wrote: "#makinglightofasituation sorry for the laughs guys (sic)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Although some fans didn't see the funny side of the post, with one - Gorgia Rose - writing: "How dare you cover Zayn's face? Don't f**king do it again."</td></tr>
