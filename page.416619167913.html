<h3>Apple Pay rival CurrentC struggles, loses CEO</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The CurrentC application (app) is demonstrated on an Apple Inc. iPhone 5s for this arranged photograph in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 30, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CurrentC, the retailer-backed mobile-payment system touted as an alternative to Apple Inc.'s platform, was hacked during a test of the technology, resulting in some e-mail addresses being stolen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In this photo taken Friday, Oct. 17, 2014, Eddy Cue, Apple Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, demonstrates the new Apple Pay mobile payment system at a Whole Foods store in Cupertino, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple launched the payment system that sidesteps wallets, the latest way for people to use their phones instead of cash or plastic to pay stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple Pay rival CurrentC is losing ground even before it launches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Like Apple Pay, the mobile payment app plans to work with credit cards, allowing customers to make purchases with smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But CurrentC experienced a major setback Monday, when the nation's largest electronics chain, Best Buy - one of its early supporters - said it would accept Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A day later, the group behind CurrentC announced that CEO Dekkers Davidson is leaving the organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"CurrentC appears to be clutching at straws," said Jordan McKee, a senior mobile payments analyst at 451 Research.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>CurrentC has exclusive agreements with certain retailers, which might have given it an advantage over Apple Pay, released last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But when those agreements expire, McKee said, he expects those retailers will join Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There's a lot of internal conflict and turmoil on how CurrentC should look when it's deployed," McKee said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's a difficult time for them right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>CurrentC is being developed by the Merchant Customer Exchange in Boston, a retail group formed to create a "customer-centric and secure" mobile payment system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The app tracks coupons, connects with checking accounts and store credit and debit accounts, and has plans to one day accept credit cards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Meanwhile, Apple Pay has mainly concentrated on bank-issued credit and debit cards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>CurrentC began a pilot program last year, and there are plans to bring an early-stage version to a midsize market in the middle of this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The group said that the results from the pilot project have been positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We are in this for the long haul, and are taking the time to create the right solution, ensuring that CurrentC is a consumer- and merchant-friendly mobile payments network," the Merchant Customer Exchange said in an e-mail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>CurrentC said last year that there were more than 50 retailers supporting its app, including Walmart, arts and crafts chain Michaels and apparel stores including Old Navy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Apple Pay was initially available in more than 220,000 retail locations, including McDonald's, Petco and Macy's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In March, Apple said there were 700,000 locations participating in Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The two payment systems can co-exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>CurrentC said it believes there should be at least two to three mobile payment companies, and that it supports "our merchant partners' quest to do what's best for their customers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Best Buy said it is still part of the Merchant Customer Exchange and will continue to evaluate CurrentC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The electronics retailer has already started accepting Apple Pay on its Best Buy app and will take Apple Pay at retail stores later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Today's consumers have many different ways to spend their money and we want to give our customers as many options as possible in how they pay for goods and services at Best Buy," the retailer said in a blog post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Apple Pay works with near-field communication technology, allowing customers to hold their iPhone 6 devices or Apple Watches next to a sensor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>For every transaction, Apple gets a cut of the fee that goes to issuing banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>CurrentC still has large retail supporters, including Walmart, and creating a separate payment platform has its benefits - including more specialization for each retailer and stores potentially paying lower transaction fees, analysts said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>While stores like Macy's accept Apple Pay, store credit cards are not part of the Apple Pay program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But CurrentC has stumbled in its execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Two of the app's supporters, Rite Aid and CVS, starting accepting Apple Pay last year, only to suddenly stop, with some analysts speculating that had to do with its ties to CurrentC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Then, in October, a service that stored CurrentC related e-mail addresses was breached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>On Tuesday, Merchant Customer Exchange, named Brian Mooney interim CEO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He has served as CEO of Bank of America Merchant Services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The company said that Davidson is leaving to "pursue other opportunities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The fact that CurrentC isn't available yet and that Best Buy is joining Apple Pay could cause other retailers to reconsider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"That might be the proverbial break in the dam," said Burt Flickinger III, managing director of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>This holiday season could be a turning point for either payment system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Flickinger said that up to 35 percent of all credit, debit and mobile payment transactions happen in the last 10 weeks of the year.</td></tr>
