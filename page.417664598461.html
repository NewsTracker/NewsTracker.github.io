<h3>Spotify gets investment as it faces competition from Apple</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) - Music streaming company Spotify said Wednesday it has gotten a new investment from a Nordic telecoms company as it looks to compete globally, particularly with a rival service that Apple is due to launch this month.</td></tr>
