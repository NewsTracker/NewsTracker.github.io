<h3>Pro- and anti-Netanyahu protesters cry out from Capitol Hill</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"Netanyahu is here to send a message to prevent a nuclear holocaust, a nuclear proliferation throughout the Middle East," said one pro-Netanyahu protester.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Brian Becker from the Answer Coalition pointed out that Israel has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Iran is within the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. They have the right to develop nuclear power for civilian use as does every other country on the planet. The IAEA inspects Iran more than any other country in the world. Israel, on the other hand, refuses to sign the treaty with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), because Israel, in fact, has nuclear weapons," said Becker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Despite Israel's nuclear programme being an open secret, the official Israeli position is that it does not confirm or deny its existence.</td></tr>
