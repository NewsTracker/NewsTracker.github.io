<h3>Ricciardo in love with Montreal's F1 track</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Daniel Ricciardo is in love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He can't get enough of the curves, kisses and screams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Of Montreal's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, that is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The track was the site of his maiden Formula One victory and is the venue for this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Winning has made me love it a little bit more, but really I've loved it since my first lap back when I was driving for Toro Rosso," the Australian said in his race preview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I remember coming back into the pits and saying `what a circuit'. I was amazed at how good it was - and I'd only done an install (lap)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The ability to jump across the kerbs and bounce the car around makes it a "ridiculous" amount of fun, Ricciardo says, which reminds him of his go-kart days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"And I love that," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"You can get aggressive with it, and aim to just brush the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Some guys will play it safe and sacrifice half a 10th (of a second) to get through there cleanly; others will take a risk and go flat out trying to find a little bit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The nearer you are, the faster you'll go. Give the wall a kiss and you feel pretty good; kiss it too hard and that's it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's unlikely Ricciardo will be in contention for a second straight win at the venue, given Red Bull's form in 2015.</td></tr>
