<tr><td>71</td><td>One Nepalese team had begun combing the rubble in Tamang's neighborhood, a place they had found another survivor Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>They cried out and knocked on broken concrete slabs, and then listened closely for any response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Mostly there was silence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>But when an officer named L.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Bahadu Basnet, shouted "Is anyone there?" he was shocked to get a reply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>"Who is there? Brother, I am here!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Tamang shouted weakly back from a hole in the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>The team used a jack to help support the rectangular entrance, and Basnet took off his helmet, put on a headlamp, and crawled on his arms 10 feet (3 meters) inside, pushed in by his colleagues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>He could see Tamang wedged lying down in a crevice behind a motorcycle, and was shocked how responsive he was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>"He thanked me when I first approached him," Basnet said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>"He told me his name, his address, and I gave him some water. I assured him we were near."</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>It took nearly hours to carefully clear the way for Tamang to be lifted out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Members of the U.S. Agency for International Development's Disaster Assistance Response Team brought in equipment to help and lowered a pole-mounted rotatable camera into the hole, said one of the team's members, Andrew Olvera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Looking at a pair of huge, ripped concrete floors hanging precariously like curtains on the side of the destroyed building, just above the rescue site, Olvera said the operation was dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>But, "it's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we'll risk almost anything."</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>At the Israeli field hospital, doctors X-rayed Tamang and injected him with glucose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Lt. Libby Weiss of the Israeli Defense Forces said he was dehydrated but lucid and "in remarkably good shape," with no other injuries except scratches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Naryan Pandey was standing on the main street outside when a dazed Tamang was carried on the stretcher, blinking at the sky in a dark shirt with the New York Yankees logo and the words "New York Authentic."</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>"I'm surprised he's still alive. We've seen dead bodies coming out of the rubble for five days," Pandey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>"But it doesn't change what we are going through. I've barely eaten. We don't have enough water. I'm hungry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>And then he added, eyeing the rubble beyond: "My friend is still in there. He was a cook. He's still there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>People watch as Nepal policemen and US rescue workers prepare to pull out Pemba Tamang, a teenage boy from the rubble of a building five days after the earthquake in Kathmandu, Nepal, Thursday, April 30, 2015.</td></tr>
