<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - Defense lawyers are asking a jury to spare the life of an Alabama woman convicted of running her granddaughter to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jurors will be back in court in Gadsden on Wednesday for a sentencing hearing for 49-year-old Joyce Hardin Garrard.</td></tr>
