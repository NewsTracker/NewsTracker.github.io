<h3>After Cyclone Pam, Vanuatu revives, rebuilds and rethinks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>She's now living with two other staff members in the only classroom that's still habitable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And she's running low on the rice she had before Cyclone Pam tore through Vanuatu a week ago, upending her life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Uhi is moving forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She's helped organize a community cleanup of the Manua Centre School grounds on the main island of Efate on Monday, and is determined that her 314 students will return to school as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A week after the cyclone tore through the South Pacific archipelago with winds of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour, people are focused on the task of rebuilding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The signs of progress are everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The road that rings the main island is now accessible to all vehicles following temporary repairs to bridges, and the cell network that's vital to keeping people connected is gradually being restored on Efate and some other islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On the sides of roads, crews have been repairing electricity lines and residents cutting tree trunks into fire-sized slices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The task remains enormous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Many of the outlying islands still don't have any way to communicate with the outside world, while tourism, vital to the economy, has taken a huge hit, with many operators fielding call after call to cancel bookings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Throughout Vanuatu, many people remain worried about the most basic necessities: water, shelter and food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Around 65,000 people across Vanuatu are in need of temporary emergency shelter, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which raised the death toll from the cyclone to 16 on Saturday, after confirming three more casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Vanuatu and other small island nations face unique challenges in recovery due to their remote location and scattered populations, said Osnat Lubrani, the United Nations' Humanitarian Coordinator for Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Delivering services even when there isn't a crisis is hard and expensive, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"So certainly in a time of disaster, that makes things very difficult," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"On the positive side, I think people are extremely resilient."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Lubrani said the total price tag for the rebuild is still unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Neighbors New Zealand and Australia quickly committed millions of dollars toward the relief effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There's also been millions more committed by other countries, including France, the U.S., the United Arab Emirates and South Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Relief agencies are also moving enormous resources into the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But for people like Uhi, the school principal, the response can't come quick enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She's been given some tents by World Vision, but needs much more help, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mothers have been coming by every day to ask when their children can return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"There's a little bit of heartbreak," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I really want the children to be able to go back to school."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The government has canceled all classes across the nation until March 30, although there's no guarantee the Manua school will be ready to open then.</td></tr>

<h3>Tunisia arrests suspected militants after museum attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tunis: Tunisian authorities have arrested more than 20 suspected militants following the Bardo museum attack when gunmen killed foreign tourists, leading to a nationwide security crackdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hundreds of Tunisians gathered for a mass in the cathedral in Tunis on Saturday, lighting candles to remember the victims - 20 foreign tourists, including one Australian, and three Tunisians - in a ceremony attended by government ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Outside, there was a heavy police presence along the capital's central Habib Bourguiba boulevard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Wednesday's assault - the most deadly attack involving foreigners in Tunisia since a 2002 suicide bombing in Djerba - came at a fragile moment for a country just emerging to full democracy after its pioneering popular uprising four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mourners attend a Mass held for victims of the Bardo museum attack at St Vincent de Paul Cathedral in Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The government said the two gunmen had trained in jihadi camps in Libya before the attack at the museum inside the heavily secured Tunisian parliament compound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Australian, Japanese, French, Polish, and Colombian visitors were among the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Authorities have arrested more than 20 suspected militants, including 10 believed to be directly involved in the Bardo attack, Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui said on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There is a large-scale campaign against the extremists," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The government plans to deploy the army to major cities to increase security following the shootings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the attack, but social media accounts tied to an al-Qaeda-affiliated group in Tunisia have also published details purportedly about the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Whoever was responsible, the Bardo attack illustrates how Islamist militants are turning their attention to North Africa, especially in neighbouring Libya where two rival governments battle for control allowing Islamic State to gain a foothold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The United States is increasingly worried about the growing presence of Islamic State militants in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>US officials said that because of its strategic position, Libya has become a springboard for would-be fighters from across North Africa wanting to link up with Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They could travel from there to Syria for frontline experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Four years after a popular revolt toppled autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has completed its transition to democracy with free elections, a new constitution and compromise politics between secular and Islamist parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The country is heavily reliant on foreign tourists to its beach resorts and desert treks.</td></tr>
