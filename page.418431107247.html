<h3>Review: Microsoft Office navigates a world of multiple devices</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK -- Microsoft's new Office apps do a good job of helping us navigate a world in which we frequently switch from one device to another -- from a Mac to a Windows PC, with a smartphone or tablet along the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company released Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac on Thursday and new apps for Android phones two weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>New ones for Windows phones and tablets are coming this summer and for Windows PCs this fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They join apps for iPads, iPhones and Android tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An Office 365 subscription gets you all this -- $70 for a single Mac or Windows PC at a time, or $100 for five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mobile apps are free, though a subscription unlocks advance features that most people won't need.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mac and Windows versions are sold the traditional way, too, with a one-time payment, though you can't use Office on another PC without buying it again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This product image provided by Microsoft shows Microsoft Word for Mac, part of the new Microsoft Office 2016 Mac suite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It took five years, but the Mac version of Office no longer feels second-class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The new Office 2016 for Mac is very similar to the existing Windows version, which will get its own Office 2016 update this fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tabs such as "Home," "Insert" and "Design" are in the same order in both versions, unlike Office 2011 for Mac.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Mac gets various keyboard shortcuts I'm used to on Windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>No longer do I have to navigate menus to get to things I use often.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>New to Office 2016 is a quick-access sharing button to collaborate more easily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>If you keep files on Microsoft's OneDrive storage service, changes made by others will sync with your copy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>No more looking for the latest version of a file in email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Again reflecting the multi-device nature of our lives, the "Recent" button will get you the files you recently opened, regardless of the device (at least if you use OneDrive).</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And with one click in Word, you can jump to where you left off on the previous device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>For spreadsheets, the new version brings a "Recommended Charts" feature from Windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>You're shown previews of charts that make the most sense for a given data set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>For presentations, the Mac gets advanced transitions and other animations previously restricted to Windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Those with an Office 365 subscription can get the Mac Office starting Thursday at http://office.microsoft.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Microsoft will sell Office for a one-time payment starting in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Prices haven't been announced; previous versions started at $140 for a base package that doesn't include Outlook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Word for writing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, Outlook for email and OneNote for organization are available for the Mac and all other devices, while less-used apps such as Publisher and Access are for Windows desktops and laptops only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>This product image provided by Microsoft shows Microsoft Excel for Mac, part of the new Microsoft Office 2016 Mac suite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>There will be two versions of Office for Windows -- PC and mobile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>You can run both at once, but I don't recommend it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sometimes a document will open in one version when I really want the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Choose one and stick with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>-- Office 2013, to be replaced by Office 2016 this fall, is designed for desktops and laptops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>While it can also run on tablets, it is better for devices with keyboards and mouse controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>-- Mobile versions are designed for tablets and optimized for touch screens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But they can also run on desktops and laptops -- at least those that get Windows 10 when the free update comes out July 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>(Windows 10 phones will also get new mobile apps.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Mobile apps are complementary rather than substitutes for the PC versions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>They have limits, regardless of whether you use Windows, Android or Apple's iOS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>For instance, you can open only one document at a time, making cutting and pasting between documents cumbersome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>They aren't meant for writing novels, at least without a physical keyboard accessory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Phones have even fewer features than tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But mobile is great for proofreading and editing existing documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>You can add comments and sync changes across devices through OneDrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>I've turned to the tablet on trains and planes, even when a laptop is in my backpack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>This product image provided by Microsoft shows the new PowerPoint app for Android devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Android versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint are now available in the Google store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Documents preserve fonts, formatting and page breaks from device to device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Text is tiny when fitting a full page on a phone's screen, but there's a "Reflow" button to temporarily reformat text for the smaller display.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Some devices require manual saving, and locations change for tasks such as search and Excel text wrap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The iPad app is the most complete, though the upcoming one for Windows tablets comes close.</td></tr>
