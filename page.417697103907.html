<h3>Teen pleads guilty to helping friend join Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ALEXANDRIA, Virginia (AP) - A 17-year-old pleaded guilty Thursday to terrorism charges for helping another teen travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ali Shukri Amin pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to terrorists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Before his arrest, Amin was an honor student at a local high school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The teen, who now faces up to 15 years in prison, appeared in federal court Thursday in a blue prison jumpsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Juveniles rarely face federal criminal charges, and the case remained under seal for several months while prosecutors navigated the process to have the charges moved into adult court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Amin admitted that he helped 18-year-old Reza Niknejad to travel to Syria to join the group in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FBI Assistant Director Andrew McCabe said that after taking Niknejad to the airport, Amin delivered a letter and thumb drive to Niknejad's family informing them that they would likely never see him again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>U.S. Attorney Dana Boente said Niknejad made it to Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Charges against Niknejad were unsealed Thursday in Alexandria outside Washington, alleging he conspired to provide material support to terrorists and conspired to kill and injure people abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Amin also admitted to using Twitter to provide advice and encouragement to the Islamic State and its supporters, according to a statement of facts filed with the plea agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Through his Twitter handle Amreekiwitness - Amreeki translates to "American" - Amin provided instruction on how to use Bitcoin, a virtual currency, to mask funds going to the group and helped supporters seeking to travel to Syria to fight with the group, court documents said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Last year, Amin's Twitter feed drew the attention of the State Department, which under its "Think Again Turn Away" social media campaign sought to counter Amin's glorification of the Islamic State and debated him directly online, at one point telling AmreekiWitness to "join reality."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Court documents say that beginning in September, Amin began efforts to convert Niknejad, who was born in Tehran, Iran, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen at age 6, to a radical form of Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The court documents indicate Amin referred to Niknejad as "ex-Shia" in his contacts facilitating Niknejad's travel - the Islamic State organization is dominated by Sunni extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Amin used code words online, substituting "Syracuse" for "Syria" and "basketball" for "jihad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Charges against Niknejad were unsealed Thursday in Alexandria, alleging he conspired to provide material support to terrorists and conspired to kill and injure people abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He is still believed to be in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>McCabe said the case illustrates the danger of online propaganda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said Amin was "brought into this seductive, destructive ideology by the material he consumed online."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Authorities said Amin was a sophisticated user of social media and that he also helped people make anonymous financial contributions to the Islamic State using Bitcoin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Defense lawyer Joseph Flood said Amin was motivated by sincere religious beliefs and outrage at the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.</td></tr>
