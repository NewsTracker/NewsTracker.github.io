<tr><td>4</td><td>SOCHI, Russia (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin with an eye on easing badly strained relations over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kerry laid a wreath at a World War II memorial in the Black Sea resort city Tuesday before holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Later, he was to meet Putin on the brief visit, his first to Russia since May 2013 and the advent of the Ukraine crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The top U.S. diplomat plans to test Putin's willingness to push pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine to comply with an increasingly fragile ceasefire agreement, according to U.S. officials traveling with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kerry will also seek to gauge the status of Russia's support for embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose forces have been losing ground to rebels, and press Moscow to support a political transition that could end that war, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In addition, Kerry will make the case to Putin that Russia should not proceed with its planned transfer of an advanced air defense system to Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Kerry's trip comes at a time when relations between Washington and Moscow have plummeted to post-Cold War lows amid the disagreements over Ukraine and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a sign of the considerable strains, the Kremlin said Monday that the Putin meeting was not confirmed, although U.S. officials insisted it was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A senior State Department official brushed aside the non-confirmation of the meeting from the Russian side, saying tersely, "We usually don't go to Sochi to see Foreign Minister Lavrov."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Tuesday morning, the Kremlin finally confirmed that Putin will meet with Kerry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Putin's spokesman welcomed Kerry's decision to travel to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We have repeatedly stated at various levels and the president has said that Russia never initiated the freeze in relations and we are always open for displays of political will for a broader dialogue," Dmitry Peskov told journalists in Sochi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Russia's Foreign Ministry had previewed the talks by blaming Washington for the breakdown in relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The Obama administration chose the path of scaling back bilateral relations, proclaimed a course of isolating Russia on the international arena and demanded that those states that traditionally follow the lead of Washington support its confrontational steps," it said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ukraine's crisis, it said, "was largely provoked by the United States itself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The rhetoric hardly augured well for a breakthrough on any of the many issues dividing the U.S. and Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Nevertheless, both sides stressed the importance of trying to work through some of the rancor that buried President Barack Obama's first-term effort to "reset" ties with Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged the "complicated" relationship between the former foes, but insisted they could cooperate on "interests that benefit the citizens of both our countries."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Much hinges on violence decreasing in Ukraine, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Western-backed government in Kiev continues to be embroiled in a sporadic conflict between government and separatist rebel forces in its eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk despite a cease-fire agreement sealed in mid-February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Russia was party to that deal; although the U.S. was not, one State Department official said it is important for Putin "to hear directly from the United States that we are firmly committed to (its) implementation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Western nations say Russia supports the separatists with arms and manpower, and even directs some battlefield operations - all claims Moscow denies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In return, the Russians bristle at Washington's provisions to Ukraine of military assistance in the form of hardware and training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Diplomats in Moscow and Washington are at odds over a range of other issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Russia last month announced it would lift a five-year ban on delivery of an air defense missile system to Iran, drawing a hasty rebuke from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The White House said the missile system would give the Islamic republic's military a strong deterrent against any air attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Kremlin argues that the S-300 is a purely defensive system that will not jeopardize the security of Israel or any other countries in the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>On Syria, Russia has defied a chorus of international condemnation to remain allied with Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Following his stop in Sochi, Kerry will travel to Antalya, Turkey, where he will attend a meeting of NATO foreign ministers Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Kerry will then return to Washington to attend meetings Thursday with Obama and top officials of the Persian Gulf Arab states, who are concerned about the possibility of a nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
