<h3>Greece in 'final stage' of bail-out talks as bank shares collapse for a third day</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As shares in Greece's benchmark index continued to plummet, Alexis Tsipras said meetings between the government and Greece's creditors had made good progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We are in the final stretch," said Mr Tsipras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Despite the difficulties we are facing we hope this agreement can end uncertainty on the future of Greece."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greek bank shares plunged for a third day on Wednesday, after the end of a five-week shutdown sparked the biggest stock market drop on record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bank shares have fallen close to the maximum 30pc allowed for two straight days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Discussions between Greece and representatives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Central Bank (ECB), European Commission (EC) and the European Stability Mechanism, or bail-out fund, started in the last week of July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Tsipras suggested that the European Parliament should also be involved in talks, describing it as a "democratic" and "accountable" institution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said: "It should at some point be under the control and monitoring of the European Parliament, a democratic institution which has accountability," Mr Tsipras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the EC, echoed Mr Tsipras's comments on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He told reporters that an agreement on a third bailout for Greece was likely to be agreed this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"All the reports I am getting suggest an accord this month, preferably before the 20th," when Greece must repay some &#x20ac;3.4bn due to the ECB, Mr Juncker said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greece's ruling party also urged its members on Wednesday to back a third bail-out deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Nikos Filis, a spokesman for Syriza, said Athens was seeking a full agreement so that it could receive a first payment of &#x20ac;25bn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He rejected the idea of a second bridging loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Good progress?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We are seeking to have a deal," he told state television station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The deal will have tough measures. What is important is that the financing of the Greek economy starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We will not accept new [reform conditions] in order to have a small bridge loan," Filis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We want one final deal to be signed and then we will see what is needed to have a disbursement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece's finance minister, said on Tuesday that talks to privatise &#x20ac;50bn worth of Greek assets - a condition of the agreement - had also made good progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We have submitted a proposal to [the creditors]," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"There were small divergences in views. I don't think there will be a problem. Discussions have gone better than I expected."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A deal must be must be settled by August 20 - or a second bridge loan agreed - if Greece is to pay off a &#x20ac;3.5bn debt owed to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It came as the ECB reportedly decided on Wednesday to leave its emergency credit lifeline for Greece unchanged for the next two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Last month, the central bank raised its Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) for Greece's struggling banks by &#x20ac;900m to &#x20ac;90.4bn, after Athens and its creditors reached an in-principle agreement for a third rescue package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A separate survey of eurozone businesses showed growth accelerated at the end of last month as companies largely put the Greek debt crisis behind them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>With conditions and sentiment improving in the bloc after the deal, Markit's July final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 53.9, beating an earlier estimate of 53.7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"The eurozone economy showed reassuring resilience in the face of the Greek debt crisis in July," said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>However, an earlier gauge this week showed Greek manufacturing output fell to the lowest level ever recorded as capital controls strangled Greek businesses.</td></tr>
