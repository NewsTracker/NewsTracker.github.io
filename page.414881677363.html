<h3>Signs of tensions emerge among Islamic State militants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Signs of tension and power struggles are emerging among the ranks of its foreign fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The extremists remain a formidable force, and the group's hold on about a third of Iraq and Syria remains firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it appears to be on the defensive in Syria for the first time since it swept through the territory last year and is suffering from months of U.S.-led coalition air strikes and the myriad factions fighting it on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They are struggling with new challenges that did not exist before," said Lina Khatib, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kurdish forces dealt the Islamic State its heaviest setback by driving it from the border town of Kobani in northern Syria last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Since then, those forces have joined with moderate Syrian rebels to recapture about 215 villages in the same area, Kurdish commanders said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The militants are also finding themselves bogged down in costly battles with the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is too early to call the shifts a turning point, but they represent the slow grind of the international campaign against the group, which long seemed unconquerable as it seized territory stretching from outside the city of Aleppo in northern Syria's at one end to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad at the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Since the loss of Kobani, signs of fissures within the group have emerged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Bari Abdellatif, a resident of al-Bab who has fled to Turkey, said friction between Chechen and Uzbek militants recently led to clashes in which two senior figures were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Several other activists confirmed recent clashes between factions from different national backgrounds within Islamic state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While foreigners from around the globe have joined Islamic State, many disillusioned new recruits have left or are trying to leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militant group has killed more than 120 of its own members in six months, most of them foreign fighters hoping to return home.</td></tr>
