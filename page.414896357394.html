<h3>Kiev accuses Russia of sending more tanks to east Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Fighting persisted in east Ukraine on Friday despite new European efforts to ensure a ceasefire takes hold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>DEBALTSEVE, Ukraine/KIEV (Reuters) - Kiev accused Russia on Friday of sending more tanks and troops into eastern Ukraine and said they were heading towards the rebel-held town of Novoazovsk on the southern coast, expanding their presence on what it fears could be the next battlefront.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Russia did not immediately respond to the accusation which, if confirmed, would go further to kill off a European-brokered truce that was met by relentless rebel advances after it came into force on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Moscow has always denied accusations in the past that its forces are fighting in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nevertheless, there were signs that the rebels may be prepared to halt their advance, having achieved their main military objective this week by seizing the strategic town of Debaltseve in defiance of the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Reuters journalists in the battle zone, including Debaltseve itself now firmly in rebel hands, said it was quieter than it had been for days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kiev and the rebels both announced a new agreement, signed by Ukrainian generals and separatist leaders, to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line, one of the main requirements of the truce deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kiev's biggest worry is that rebels will continue their advance to threaten Mariupol, a highly strategic port of 500,000 people that is the biggest city still under government control in the two rebellious eastern provinces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Novoazovsk, where Kiev said Russia was reinforcing, lies 40 km (25 miles) to the east along the coast near the Russian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In recent days, despite the Minsk (ceasefire) agreement, military equipment and ammunition have been sighted crossing from Russia into Ukraine," military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said more than 20 Russian tanks, 10 missile systems and busloads of troops had crossed the frontier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The United States, which is considering tightening sanctions against Russia and arming Kiev, also says it has sighted Russian reinforcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The State Department said Russian support for the rebels was undermining international diplomacy and would bring "costs" on Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Western nations have held out hope they can revive a peace deal brokered by France and Germany in the Belarussian capital Minsk on Feb. 12, even though the rebels ignored it to seize Debaltseve, a town on a strategic railway hub, inflicting one of the worst defeats of the 10-month-old war on Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We are more convinced than ever that they must be applied - all the agreements, nothing but the agreements," French President Francois Hollande said in Paris alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In Debaltseve, where Kiev was forced to withdraw thousands of besieged troops this week, the black, blue and red flag of the rebels' self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic flew over the town hall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Artillery could be heard in the distance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Walls were pock-marked by bullets or had huge holes blown in them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Burnt-out hulks of tanks and military trucks lay abandoned on the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Heavily armed rebels and tanks patrolled the streets on the outskirts, where bridges had been blown up and the railway appeared to have suffered major damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A separatist fighter picked out ammunition left by fleeing government troops from the rubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"These are ours now, and we'll use them against them. We have to expand," said the rebel who refused to give his name, straightening up while a dozen others continued their search for arms and ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The town held around 27,000 people before the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Most fled during the battle, but thousands remained trapped inside, sheltering in cellars during days of relentless bombardment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Several hundred lined up for food in the centre of town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Many were weeping as they stood in the queue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We're waiting. They should bring dry meals in blue packaging since the pasta is already finishing," said Yulia, 28, a teacher, holding her 10-year-old niece by the hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In the capital Kiev, the military setbacks darkened the mood as crowds gathered for the first anniversary of an uprising that toppled the Moscow-leaning president Viktor Yanukovich and culminated in war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko accused a top aide to Russia's Vladimir Putin of being behind the sniper killings of 100 Ukrainian protesters on the streets of Kiev during the uprising a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Just a few days ago, the head of state security told me that special forces operatives gave evidence that the Russian presidential aide Vladislav Surkov led the organisation of groups of foreign snipers on the Maidan," Poroshenko told some of the relatives of those killed, according to his website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Russia's Foreign Ministry called the accusation "madness".</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Crowds headed to observe the anniversary at Independence Square in the heart of the capital, known locally as "the Maidan" and revered by Ukrainians as platform of a revolution that turned the country away from Russia and towards Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"We have shown the world, we have shown everyone that we can stand against the regime without weapons, that we are free people and we will fight till the end, till victory," said Mykola Tokar who travelled from the Lviv region in the west to attend the ceremonies in Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Some people wore combat fatigues showing allegiance to pro-government militias that have fought alongside Kiev's troops against pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The mood was sombre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>More than 5,600 people have been killed in fighting since mid-April last year, soon after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine following Yanukovich's overthrow.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine says rebels continue attacks despite ceasefire deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Amid the tensions, Moscow sternly warned the cash-strapped Ukraine that its pay for Russian gas would only last for a few more days, raising the specter of another gas war with potential repercussions for Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A Ukrainian military spokesman said the Russia-backed rebels fired on Ukrainian positions nearly 50 times in the past 24 hours and that Russia sent more tanks into Ukraine despite a cease-fire that was supposed to begin Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The rebels, meanwhile, claimed that Ukrainian forces had violated the cease-fire more than 20 times Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The government claims, which followed the rebel seizure of the key rail hub of Debaltseve, raised the question of whether weeks of high-level diplomacy aimed at producing a cease-fire and a peace plan had simply allowed the rebels to redouble efforts to grab more territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The village of Kurakhovo, west of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, was hit by Grad rockets and the village of Berdyansk, near the key port city of Mariupol, was hit overnight by artillery and mortar fire, Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Anatoliy Stelmakh, a Ukrainian military spokesman, told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russia is still moving military equipment into Ukraine, including 10 tanks brought into Novoazovsk, near Mariupol, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>French President Francois Hollande, who brokered the peace deal last week together with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Friday he did not have confirmation about Russian tanks entering Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"That doesn't mean this doesn't exist," he said, underscoring the need for the cease-fire to take hold and halt the risk of escalation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Vladislav Seleznyev, a spokesman for Ukraine's military general staff, said two soldiers had been killed in the past day and 110 were being held prisoner by the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both sides were supposed to begin drawing back heavy weapons from the front lines Tuesday, but international monitors say they have seen no signs of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>CBC News correspondent Nahlah Ayed is in eastern Ukraine with producer Tracy Seeley and cameraman Richard Devey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ayed sent this report Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Donetsk is a city on pause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Despite the ceasefire, it still suffers the symptoms of war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Many shops are shuttered, some people live without electricity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Others must rely on humanitarian aid to survive, and still live in basement shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The buses are running, but the ATM's long ago ran out of cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Credit cards are no longer accepted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Factories are mostly idle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A significant proportion of the population has left altogether, and to return, must run a gauntlet of three Ukrainian military and four rebel checkpoints.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Gone are the tires and razor wire of the sit-ins at Donetsk's administrative buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They're now protected by armed rebels in uniform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The masks are gone too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But they are firmly in charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As of yesterday, Donetsk is supplied with Russian gas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And except for the shelling which goes on all day, Donetsk is a city beyond Kyiv's control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Concerns are rising that the rebels are still gunning to take Mariupol, a government-held city on the Sea of Azov that could allow them to create a land bridge between Russia and Crimea, which Russia annexed last March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Crimea has no physical link to Russian territory now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>On Thursday, the rebels celebrated their victory over Ukrainian forces in Debaltseve, a key transport hub linking the two largest rebel strongholds in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Rebel fighters roamed the town's debris-littered streets, laughing, hugging and posing for photos, although the death of one fighter when his vehicle hit a land mine was a sharp reminder of the dangers that still lurked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Ukrainian soldiers who made it out of Debaltseve alive on Thursday described weeks of harrowing rebel shelling, followed by a chaotic, hasty retreat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Ukrainian officials said 13 soldiers had been killed and 157 wounded in the fighting, but the shell-shocked soldiers themselves spoke of many more casualties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Starting at night, they would fire at us just to stop us from sleeping. They did this all night," a Ukrainian soldier named Andrei said after fleeing Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Then in the morning, they would attack, wave after wave."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>While fighting continued in the east, Ukraine raised the pressure on the separatists Thursday by cutting off shipments of natural gas to the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The national gas company Naftogaz linked the cutoff to damaged gas transit infrastructure and said supplies were resumed later in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Friday that Ukraine has still failed to restore gas shipments to the east, "putting people's lives and health under threat."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Medvedev reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he ordered the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom to provide supplies directly to the east, which will be counted as part of the overall volume of Russian gas exports to Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Following a bruising price and debt dispute last year, Russia now requires Ukraine to pay in advance for gas shipments, and Medvedev warned that its latest pay would only be good for another three to four days at the current level of consumption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The statement raised the prospect of a cutoff in supplies that could affect European customers, who receive the bulk of Russian gas via pipelines crossing Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The war in eastern Ukraine has killed more than 5,600 people and forced over a million to flee their homes since fighting began in April, a month after Russia annexed Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Russia denies arming the rebels or supplying fighters, but Western nations and NATO point to satellite pictures of Russian military equipment in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>In Kyiv, nationalists criticized the government for allowing Debaltseve to fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Friday was a key anniversary for the months of anti-government protests in 2013-14 that brought down Ukraine's previous, Kremlin-friendly government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>A year ago, sniper fire tore through crowds of protesters on Kyiv's main square, killing more than 50 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Dozens more died in earlier clashes with police or were beaten to death under mysterious circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>On Friday evening, President Petro Poroshenko was to be among those honouring them at a memorial ceremony in Kyiv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Hollande and Merkel, who oversaw marathon peace talks last week between the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, warned Friday that more EU sanctions could be levelled if the peace accords to stabilize Ukraine are not respected.</td></tr>
