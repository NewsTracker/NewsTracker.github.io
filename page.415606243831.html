<h3>Israeli Arabs say they feel more excluded after election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>RAMLA, Israel (AP) - Israeli Arabs emerged from this week's parliament election with more political clout but also a greater sense of exclusion, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rallied his supporters by suggesting a high turnout of Arab voters would put his rule in danger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The election, in which Netanyahu eventually secured his fourth term, highlighted the fraught relationship between Israel's Arab citizens and the Jewish state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Arabs voted in larger numbers than before and turned the main party representing them, the Joint List, into the third-largest in parliament, signaling they are more willing to work within the political system to seek equality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But some also said the campaign, which has polarized Israeli society, reflected an increasingly hostile atmosphere toward Arabs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I felt like someone stuck a knife in my heart because I am always pushing for equality between Arabs and Jews," Zuhair Bahloul, a veteran Arab sportscaster known for his pitch-perfect game commentary in Hebrew, said of Netanyahu's election day remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There is a bit of a feeling of despair because the prime minister is not the prime minister of all citizens, and the right is trying to push the Arabs aside," said Baloul, 64, who will enter parliament for the center-left Zionist Union, which failed to unseat Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In what was seen as an attempt to galvanize his hard-line supporters during Tuesday's election, Netanyahu had warned that "Arab voters are going in droves to the polls," with the help of "left-wing" activists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A posting on his Facebook page at midday during the balloting said the high turnout by Arab voters was putting right-wing rule "in danger."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Israeli leader has since said in interviews with U.S. media outlets that he had been misunderstood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He told NBC that he hadn't been trying to suppress Arab voting rights, but to "counter a foreign-funded effort to get the votes that are intended to topple my party."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Asked by NPR if he would engage in fence-mending, given how his remarks were received, Netanyahu said: "Well, I certainly will make sure that everybody understands that I'm the prime minister of all of Israel's citizens, and I really believe that. It's something that my actions have shown. It's not a question of fence-mending, it's a question of real belief, and it's there. I don't have to fabricate it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Earlier, White House spokesman Josh Earnest criticized the original comments as a "cynical election day tactic (that) was a pretty transparent effort to marginalize Arab Israeli votes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, told The Associated Press that anti-Arab rhetoric by Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman - who regularly accuses Arab politicians of representing terrorist groups - pose an "existential threat" to Arab citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Odeh said his party, which won 13 seats in the 120-member Knesset, will respond by fighting to improve the lives of 1.7 million Arabs, who account for just over 20 percent of Israel's population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He has said his party will work on shared issues with center-left Jewish opposition parties and seek membership in key parliamentary committees.</td></tr>
