<tr><td>15</td><td>DANNEMORA, N.Y. (AP) - Two convicted murderers who used power tools to cut their way out of a prison near the Canadian border could be nearby or "in Mexico by now," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The intense manhunt focused on the fields and Adirondack woods near the prison in upstate New York after the inmates' escape was apparently hampered by a prison employee's decision to back out as their getaway driver nine days ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The inmates, David Sweat and Richard Matt, planned to have the now-jailed prison worker drive them about seven hours away to an unknown destination, District Attorney Andrew Wylie told CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But prison tailor shop instructor Joyce Mitchell backed out of the plan at the last minute, Wylie said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"One of the reasons that she didn't show up was because she did love her husband and didn't want to do this to him," Wylie said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Even as hundreds of law enforcement workers stalked the rural area about 20 miles from Canada, Cuomo said it was unclear the men were still nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We don't know if they are still in the area or if they're in Mexico by now," Cuomo said in response to a question at a news conference on school aid in the New York City suburbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Roads on the western edge of Plattsburgh were open only to local traffic and a state police helicopter was parked in a field where 24 hours earlier a contingent of 40 officers had marched into the adjacent woods on yet another grid search.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>While many local residents remained locked in their homes at the advice of authorities, the outpouring of appreciation for the search effort continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A restaurant was urging people to tie blue ribbons around trees and mailboxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But residents were very much on edge, with some saying they were keeping firearms handy just in case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Both men are considered extremely dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Sweat was serving a life sentence for killing a sheriff's deputy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Matt was serving 25 years to life for the 1997 kidnap, torture and hacksaw dismemberment of his 76-year-old former boss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The men used power tools to cut through the back of their cells, shimmied down a six-story catwalk, broke through a brick wall then cut into a steam pipe they used to reach a manhole outside the prison walls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mitchell, 51, was arraigned Friday on a felony charge of promoting prison contraband and a misdemeanor count of criminal facilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>She is accused of befriending Sweat, 35, and Matt, 48, and smuggling in hacksaw blades, chisels, a punch and a screwdriver bit to help the men escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Her lawyer entered a not guilty plea on her behalf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Mitchell's son Tobey told NBC that she would not have helped the inmates escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Cuomo said there will be "zero tolerance" for any assistance the escapees may have received.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"If an employee was facilitating or an accomplice to this escape, they will be fully prosecuted," Cuomo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Associated Press video journalist Joseph B. Frederick in Cadyville, New York, contributed to this report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>This story has been corrected to show David Sweat's age as 35.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>His birthday is June 14.</td></tr>
