<h3>Google flips out for April Fool's Day</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Web screenshot: http://com.google on April 1, 2015 (Google Inc.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The net firm played an April 1 prank with a TLD trick ending in .google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Sometimes it's important to reflect," remarked Google's Twitter account, kicking off a day of levity and cunning across the web.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Using its own Top Level Domain, all-comers were invited to visit com.google instead of the usual google.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That's just the tip of the iceberg, as the internet giant's various branches rolled out their own variations on the theme, including a game of Pac-Man that runs on Google Maps, and a hands-free keyboard integrated into a paper party horn.</td></tr>
