<h3>Russia will have to sharply lower gas price, Ukraine says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Volodymyr Demchyshyn was speaking after gas supply talks in Brussels on Friday with Russia and the European Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As expected, the meeting stopped far short of a deal, but the three sides said the atmosphere was constructive and they would meet again next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Under the current agreement, Ukraine pays $329 per thousand cubic metres for gas in the first quarter and Russia has said the price will rise to $348 after that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Russia understood that "in order to be competitive they need to go below $250," Demchyshyn told Reuters in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I estimate the reasonable price that we will end up (at will be) between $240 and $250."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With energy prices falling, he said he expected the gas price to fall to $210 to $220 in the third quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russia has cut off gas supplies to Ukraine three times in a series of price disputes over the past decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Demchyshyn said increased imports from the EU, together with falling gas consumption in Ukraine and weak energy prices, had strengthened Kiev's bargaining position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The Russian side understands that they need to be price-competitive. As long as their price will be higher than the market price - the price for the gas that we can get from Europe - we won't need Russian gas," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Commission, the EU executive, brokered an accord last October to keep gas flowing over the peak-demand winter months despite icy relations between Kiev and Moscow over the war in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Russia and Ukraine are discussing a new pricing arrangement once the current package expires at the end of March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ukraine and the Commission hope for an agreement that would include next winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The EU relies on Russia for about a third of its gas, some 40 percent of which is shipped via Ukraine, meaning any disruption to Kiev's supplies can affect the EU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Demchyshyn said Friday's talks made "fairly reasonable progress" and his next meeting with Russian counterpart Alexander Novak would probably be in Berlin in mid-April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said Ukraine had increased the volume of gas it could import from EU countries under so-called reverse flow arrangements "so now ... Ukraine can get through the winter without any specific large volume to be required from the Russian side."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last year, Ukraine greatly reduced its use of Russian gas, but the European Commission believes it cannot do without Russian gas altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ukraine estimates its needs for next winter at 15 billion cubic metres but plans to build up its stocks to 19 billion before the winter, Demchyshyn said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ukraine is demanding that Gazprom increase transit fees it pays to Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ukraine and Moscow must also discuss the thorny issue of who pays for gas supplies to separatist-held areas of east Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Asked if reaching a long-term agreement would improve relations with Russia, Demchyshyn said: "It won't impact geopolitics but geopolitics will definitely impact this deal."</td></tr>
