<h3>Royals remain unbeaten with 12-3 romp over Twins (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The defending American League champions improved to 7-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's the second-best start in Kansas City's history, behind the 2003 club that won nine in a row to begin the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Detroit, which had been the only other undefeated team in the big leagues, lost 5-4 at Pittsburgh earlier in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Duffy (1-0) went 6 1/3 innings, giving up three runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He's 4-1 with a 2.37 ERA in his career against the Twins and is undefeated in four starts at Target Field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Twins lost their fourth straight opener, but on a sunny 61-degree day they still packed the place with an over-capacity crowd of 40,123.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Minnesota Timberwolves icon Kevin Garnett, who hasn't played in a game since March 7 for the NBA team that plays across the street, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to his longtime friend Torii Hunter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hunter, who returned to the Twins this season after seven years away, tipped his helmet during a brief step out of the box to acknowledge the standing ovation during his first at-bat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The cheers were scant the rest of the afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Morales, who failed to hit a home run in 67 plate appearances at Target Field during his stint with the Twins last summer, sent a pitch from Trevor May (0-1) in the second inning into the upper deck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The scary part for the rest of the league is that the Royals, last in the majors in home runs last season, have gone deep 10 times already.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The bullpen hasn't been scored on yet, with 21 strikeouts in 19 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain on his 29th birthday and Eric Hosmer each drove in two runs for the Royals, who had five players tally two hits apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Brian Dozier scored after each of his two doubles, and Trevor Plouffe took Duffy deep in the seventh to take over first place on the ballpark's all-time home run list with 36.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the Twins needed four pitchers to finish a six-run eighth inning by the Royals, who did their damage on only two singles to accompany three walks, two hit batters, an error and a passed ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hunter was charged with a throwing error in the sixth, too, letting a run score on another shaky day for Minnesota's defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Shortstop Danny Santana let a bases-loaded ground ball bounce out of his glove with no outs, allowing another run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Royals: Alex Rios was hit on the left hand by J.R. Graham's first pitch in the eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He stayed on base and eventually scored but was removed as a precaution for Jarrod Dyson on defense in the bottom of the inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Twins: RHP Casey Fien, who has logged only one inning this season because of shoulder stiffness, was available to pitch, general manager Terry Ryan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The setup man threw in the bullpen before the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>There's no game Tuesday, with the series resuming Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Edinson Volquez will take the mound for the Royals, looking to match a sparkling debut with his new team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The right-hander needed only 95 pitches to finish eight innings and beat the White Sox last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He has faced the Twins only once, in 2007 when Joe Mauer homered against him in a no-decision at the Metrodome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Kyle Gibson will start for the Twins, coming off a rough first turn at Detroit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The right-hander equaled his career high with five walks and failed to record a strikeout for the third time in 42 major league starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Gibson, however, has beaten the Royals more than any other team, carrying a 3-0 record and 1.40 ERA in three starts against them.</td></tr>
