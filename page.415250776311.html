<h3>Kelly Clarkson Fires Back at Fat Shamer</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kelly Clarkson doesn't care what anyone thinks about her weight, not even Britain's "most hated woman."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Journalist and reality star Katie Hopkins, known as "the most hated woman in Britain," blasted Clarkson's size on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"What happened to Kelly Clarkson?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hopkins wrote on Feb. 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Did she eat all of her backing singers? Happily I have wide-screen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She went on: "Darling, if you had a baby a year ago, that is not baby weight. It is fat. Quit calling it cute names to make yourself feel better."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hopkins, who gained her reputation as the villain on "The Apprentice UK," didn't leave it there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In an interview with "Entertainment Tonight" on Wednesday, she said, "Kelly Clarkson is now a chunky monkey, if we're putting it kindly. She does look like she's eaten her backup singers. My advice: she needs to get out there with her stroller and do some pushing and get some of that weight off."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clarkson, who gave birth to daughter River Rose last June, was unfazed -- even puzzled -- by the fat-shaming comments when first asked about them by Heat magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I don't have a clue what you're talking about," she told the magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Someone tweeted something about me?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>After the reporter explained who Hopkins is and what she'd said, Clarkson laughed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Oh, and she's tweeted something nasty about me? That's because she doesn't know me," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I'm awesome! It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Added Clarkson, "I've just never cared what people think. It's more if I'm happy and I'm confident and feeling good. That's always been my thing. And more so now, since having a family -- I don't seek out any other acceptance."</td></tr>
