<h3>Netanyahu claims victory in Israel election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party has won 30 seats in the 120-member Knesset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed a come-from-behind victory in the country's general election, erasing his centre-left rivals' lead with a hard rightward shift, including abandoning a commitment to negotiate a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With nearly all the votes counted, Mr Netanyahu's Likud party had won 30 seats in the 120-member Knesset, comfortably defeating the Zionist Union opposition on 24 seats, Israeli media said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Central Elections Committee website said Likud had garnered just over 23 per cent of the vote and the Zionist Union almost 19 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israel's opposition leader, Isaac Herzog, said he had spoken with Mr Netanyahu to congratulate him on his victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"A few minutes ago I spoke with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck," Mr Herzog told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The result has amounted to a dramatic and unexpected victory - the last opinion polls published four days before the vote showed the Zionist Union with a four-seat advantage over Likud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Whatever the outcome of Israel's election, the questions for Israel's next prime minister are as vexed as they come, Tim Mayfield writes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a statement, Likud said Mr Netanyahu intended to form a new government within weeks, with negotiations already underway with the pro-settler Jewish Home party led by Naftali Bennett, as well as with religious groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Reality is not waiting for us," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The citizens of Israel expect us to quickly put together a leadership that will work for them regarding security, economy and society as we committed to do - and we will do so."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The critical party for Likud to get on-side will be centrist Kulanu, led by former Likud member Moshe Kahlon, who won 10 seats, making him a kingmaker given his ability to side with either Mr Netanyahu or the centre-left opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a four-day pre-election blitz, Mr Netanyahu made a series of promises designed to shore up his base and draw voters from other right-wing and nationalist parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This included a pledge to go on building settlements on occupied land and saying that there would be no Palestinian state if he was re-elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) responded to the election result, saying Israelis had chosen "occupation and settlement building" over peace talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Israel chose the path of racism, occupation and settlement building, and did not choose the path of negotiations and partnership between us," said senior PLO Yasser Abed Rabbo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If he manages to pull together a workable coalition, it would give Mr Netanyahu a fourth-term in office, putting him on track to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister, a label held by the country's founding father, David Ben-Gurion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While Likud is the largest party, the process of forming a coalition is likely to be difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The party needs 61 seats in the Knesset and crossing that threshold will be challenging given the amount of division across Israel's political landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's victory was also likely to prolong the country's testy relationship with US president Barack Obama, especially after his strident words on settlements and his backing away from the long-stated international goal of arriving at a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Photo: An Israeli supporter of the centre-left Zionist Union party waits for a result in Israel's parliamentary elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Despite the numbers stacking up in Mr Netanyahu's favour, Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog said "everything is still open" and that he already had spoken to party leaders about the possibility of forming a government, although the arithmetic for him is much harder to achieve than for Mr Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>During much of the campaign, Mr Netanyahu had focused on security issues and the threat from Iran's nuclear program, a message that appeared to gain little traction with voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Zionist Union's focus on socio-economic issues, including the lack of housing and the high cost of living in Israel, appeared to be generating much more momentum, at least as far as opinion polls went.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But Mr Netanyahu's tack to the right, playing up fears of the spread of Islamist groups, promising no concessions to the Palestinians and raising alarm about growing support for Arab-Israeli parties looks to have spurred his base into action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>From the Palestinian point-of-view, the results are a deep concern, raising the prospect of more settlement expansion on land they want for their own state in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as in Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>If Mr Netanyahu follows through on his pledges it would put him on a collision course with the Obama administration and the European Union, which has been weighing steps including trade measures to sanction Israel for its settlements policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Palestinians will formally become members of the International Criminal Court from April 1 and have said they will pursue war crimes charges against Israel over its 48-year occupation of the West Bank and last year's Gaza war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Pre-empting those steps, Israel has suspended the transfer of tax revenue it collects on the Palestinians' behalf, holding back around $120 million a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That has crippled the Palestinian budget and led to deep pay cuts for state workers.</td></tr>
