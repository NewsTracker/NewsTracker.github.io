<h3>Greece's deputy finance minister sues German newspaper Bild over money transfer claim</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - Greece's deputy finance minister has sued Germany's tabloid Bild newspaper over a story that appeared this month alleging he sent tens of thousands of euros to a bank account in Luxembourg at a time when his government had been appealing to Greeks to keep their savings in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dimitris Mardas filed the case against Bild in a Greek court Friday "for the restoration of the truth, his honor and his reputation," according to a finance ministry statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bild named Mardas in a May 6 publication as being the anonymous deputy minister who a newspaper in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki claimed had sent 80,000 euros to Luxembourg in March, long after the new radical left government won January elections.</td></tr>
