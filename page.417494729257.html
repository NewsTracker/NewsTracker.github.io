<h3>Yahoo to live-stream Bills-Jaguars game from London</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yahoo Inc will broadcast the Oct. 25 National Football League game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars in London in the first live-stream of an NFL game.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>The on-demand version will include commercials that viewers would not be able to skip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yahoo was hopeful of more such partnerships in the future, Cahan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The company has been trying to fight stalling revenue growth by turning towards video ads as its once-hot Web portal and email service lag those of rivals such as Google Inc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It bought automated advertising service BrightRoll for $640 million in November, saying the deal would make its video ad platform the largest in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Oct. 25 game will also be telecast in the Buffalo (WIVB-TV) and Jacksonville (WTEV-TV) markets.</td></tr>
