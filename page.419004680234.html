<h3>Egypt postpones al-Jazeera retrial verdict to August 29</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Troy Lulashnyk (R), Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, sits with other diplomats at a court in Cairo, Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Egyptian court on Sunday postponed for the second time the verdict in the retrial of Al Jazeera television journalists who have been charged with aiding a terrorist organisation, a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood, to August 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An Egyptian court on Sunday postponed delivering its verdict in the retrial of three al-Jazeera journalists, a decision a defence lawyer said was to avoid bad publicity during a visit by US Secretary of State John Kerry and other dignitaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was the second time the verdict in the internationally sensitive case has been postponed, this time to August 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The journalists deny the charges and Egypt's high court ordered a retrial in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Amal Clooney, one of Mr Fahmy's lawyers, said the adjournment appeared aimed to avoid clashing with Mr Kerry's visit to Cairo on Sunday as well as a lavish inauguration planned on Thursday for a second Suez Canal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The verdict may be coming later; but the world will still be watching," Mrs Clooney said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri said during a news conference with Mr Kerry that no journalists in Egypt were in jail over their reporting.</td></tr>
