<h3>AP source: Cavs trade Haywood, Miller to Blazers (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLEVELAND (AP) -- A person familiar with the trade says the Cavaliers have traded forward Mike Miller and center Brendan Haywood to Portland to create salary-cap room and save luxury-tax money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Cavs have been shopping Haywood's expiring $10.5 million contract deal for weeks and worked out a deal with the Blazers, who will also get two second-round picks from Cleveland, said the person who spoke Monday to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal is pending league approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Blazers are expected to cut Haywood, who barely played for Cleveland last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Miller was signed last summer, bringing playoff experience and 3-point shooting to the Cavs, but he was hardly used in the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The moves will allow the Cavs to create trade exceptions for $10.5 million and $2.85 million to sign players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yahoo! and ESPN previously reported the trade.</td></tr>
