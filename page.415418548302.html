<h3>IS accepts Boko Haram pledge of allegiance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamic State militants have accepted a pledge of allegiance by the Nigerian-grown Boko Haram extremist group, a spokesman for the Islamic State movement said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BEIRUT (AP) - Islamic State militants have accepted a pledge of allegiance by the Nigerian-grown Boko Haram extremist group, a spokesman for the Islamic State movement said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The development comes as both movements, which are among the most ruthless in the world, are under increasing military pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Islamic State seized much of northern and western Iraq last summer giving it control of about a third of both Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But it is now struggling against Iraqi forces seeking to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, while coming under fire from U.S.-led coalition air strikes in other parts of the country and in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Boko Haram, meanwhile, has been weakened by a multinational force that has dislodged it from a score of northeastern Nigerian towns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But its new Twitter account, increasingly slick and more frequent video messages and a new media arm all were considered signs that the group is now being helped by IS propagandists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Then on Saturday, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau posted an audio recording online that pledged allegiance to IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Thursday, the Islamic State group's media arm Al-Furqan, in an audio recording by spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, said that Boko Haram's pledge of allegiance has been accepted, claiming the caliphate has now expanded to West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Al-Adnani had urged foreign fighters from around the world to migrate and join Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We announce our allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims ... and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity, in hardship and ease, and to endure being discriminated against, and not to dispute about rule with those in power, except in case of evident infidelity regarding that which there is a proof from Allah," said the message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Peter Pham, director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, noted the Islamic State group's quick acceptance of Boko Haram's allegiance and said that the bond highlights a new risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Militants finding it increasingly harder to get to Syria and Iraq may choose instead to go to northeastern Nigeria and internationalize that conflict," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Boko Haram pledge of allegiance to IS comes as the militants reportedly were massing in the northeastern Nigerian town of Gwoza, considered their headquarters, for a showdown with the Chadian-led multinational force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Boko Haram killed an estimated 10,000 people last year, and it is blamed for last April's abduction of more than 275 schoolgirls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Thousands of Nigerians have fled to neighboring Chad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The group is waging a nearly 6-year insurgency to impose Muslim Shariah law in Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It began launching attacks across the border into Cameroon last year, and this year its fighters struck in Niger and Chad in retaliation to their agreement to form a multinational force to fight the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Boko Haram followed the lead of IS in August by declaring an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria that grew to cover an area the size of Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Islamic State had declared a caliphate in vast swaths of territory that it controls in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Nigerian group has also followed IS in publishing videos of beheadings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The latest one, published March 2, borrowed certain elements from IS productions, such as the sound of a beating heart and heavy breathing immediately before the execution, according to SITE Intelligence Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In video messages last year, Boko Haram's leader sent greetings and praise to both IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and leaders of al-Qaida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But Boko Haram has never been an affiliate of al-Qaida, some analysts surmise because al-Qaida considers the Nigerians' indiscriminate slaughter of Muslim civilians as un-Islamic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Recent offensives have marked a sharp escalation by African nations against Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>An African Union summit agreed on sending a force of 8,750 troops to fight Boko Haram.</td></tr>

<h3>'Ruth, Mantle, Will Ferrell'; Ferrell storms spring training</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PEORIA, Ariz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - Will Ferrell stormed through his Arizona spring training odyssey and emerged - well - just like Will Ferrell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Ruth, Musial, Mantle, Will Ferrell," he said, addressing the crowd at his final stop Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Who would have thought that one day those names would be synonymous? Show of hands - scratch that, never mind."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The star of "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," ''Elf" and many other movies started in an Oakland Athletics uniform at noon, then was off to four other ballparks, playing for each team, and at every position along the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ten teams, five ballparks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"'When I embarked on this journey way back at breakfast," Ferrell said, "I thought to myself, 'Could I do it?' The answer is yes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He hugged a guy in an elf suit as he left Mesa, held up a sign saying "Remember These Games Don't Count' as impromptu third base coach for the Chicago Cubs, struck out twice on three pitches each, watched two home runs sail over his head, and chased the ball around the outfield during a challenging stint in left field for the Arizona Diamondbacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ferrell wore No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>19 for every team except his last one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He didn't want to wear the late Tony Gwynn's number, so donned No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>20 for the Padres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When it was over, he took the public address microphone to the infield and recounted his day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There's no doubt I turned some heads today, even if it was just for a moment," Ferrell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'I brought passion to the field, dedication, ability and a lot of ignorance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The ball moves fast out there, a lot faster than it looks on television.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It's like a speeding bullet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His caravan took him from Mesa to Tempe to Scottsdale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>From there, he rode by helicopter across north Phoenix to Glendale, making a triumphant landing in the nick of time in center field at the Camelback Ranch ballpark where the San Francisco Giants and Chicago White Sox were entering the ninth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And in his final stop, in Peoria, he took the mound for the Los Angeles Dodgers and got San Diego's Rico Noel, the only batter he faced, to bounce out to the pitcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Then he walked off the mound toward second base in dismay when manager Don Mattingly came out to replace him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Mattingly already cut me," Ferrell told Hall of Fame manager Tommy Lasorda outside the dugout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Eight and one-half hours after he first took the field at shortstop for the Oakland A's, Ferrell played in right field for San Diego in the ninth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He had done it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>As he walked off the field, Ferrell waved his cap and gave a security guard a high five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"They say there's nothing more American than grabbing a hot dog, heading to the ballpark, and watching nine guys from the Dominican Republic," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"... But you know what, today I learned that was wrong. They had eight Dominicans, and one guy from Irvine, California."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The entire tour was being chronicled by HBO for a special.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Memorabilia from his journey is to be sold at auction on MLB.com with proceeds going to Cancer for College and Stand Up to Cancer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Ferrell introduced the Craig Pollard, founder of Cancer for College, saying the organization had given 2,000 scholarships to children with cancer over the past 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"On a serious, real note, what a day," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Thank you all, thanks to MLB, thanks to my family, to our production team and especially to Craig Pollard."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>When he took the field as A's shortstop, the crowd cheered when he fielded a warmup grounder.</td></tr>
