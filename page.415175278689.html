<h3>Two teachers who 'had boozy beach party with five male students' now charged with having sex with the teens and giving them COCAINE</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, from the Los Angeles suburb of Covina, were both originally only charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor over allegations that they gave booze to the students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Monday, prosecutors hit them with a slew of new, much more serious, charges, KTLA-TV reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lippert, who allegedly organized the trip, was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse and furnishing a controlled substance to a minor, both felonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ghirelli now faces charges of unlawful sexual intercourse, furnishing a controlled substance to a minor and oral copulation of a minor, all of which are also felonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prosecutors had initially said there was not enough evidence to file sex abuse charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The teachers, from South Hills High School in Corona Valley, California, allegedly went on a camping trip to San Clemente Beach with five students from December 27 through 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had previously met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to KCAL-TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The pair then met up with five students of the same group on the non-school sponsored camping, spending a night on the beach.</td></tr>

<h3>Nigeria's Boko Haram releases beheading video echoing Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>People stand by the wreckage of a car that has been blown up by suspected Boko Haram militants in Nigeria's northeastern city of Maiduguri on March 25, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nigeria's Islamist sect Boko Haram released a video purporting to show it beheading two men, its first online posting using advanced graphics and editing techniques reminiscent of footage from Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The film, released on Monday, shows militants standing behind the two men who are on their knees, their hands tied behind their backs, with one man standing over them, holding a knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One of the men is made to tell the camera that they had been paid by authorities to spy on the militant group, before the film moves to another scene showing their decapitated bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was not possible to confirm the film's authenticity or date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The footage will stoke concerns that Boko Haram, which evolved out of a clerical movement focused on northeast Nigeria, is expanding its scope and seeking inspiration from global militant networks including Al Qaeda and Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The militants who have killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in their bid to carve out an Islamist state in their homeland, have in recent months stepped up cross-border raids into Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan has said Boko Haram is allied to both Al Qaeda and its offshoot Islamic State, though that has not been confirmed by the group itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Boko Haram film's use of graphics, the footage of black-clad militants with a black flag, and the editing to show only the aftermath of the beheading, were particularly reminiscent of footage from Islamic state, which has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria and killed several hostages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the film, one of the men says he comes from Baga in Borno state, and the other says he is from Michika in Adamawa state, both areas where the army says it has recently recaptured territory from Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Past Boko Haram films have been much cruder affairs, often featuring a man identified as leader Abubakar Shekau talking more about local gripes than global jihad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A number of recent releases have included much more gruesome footage of beheadings.</td></tr>
