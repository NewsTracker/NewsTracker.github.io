<h3>5 key findings from AP's story on WHO and the Ebola outbreak</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>4, 2014 file photo, people watch as a health worker, right, sprays a man suspected of dying from Ebola with disinfectant chemicals in Monrovia, Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a delay that some say may have cost lives, the World Health Organization resisted calling the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a public health emergency until the summer of 2014, two months after staff raised the possibility and long after a senior manager called for a drastic change in strategy, The Associated Press has learned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>GENEVA (AP) - In the aftermath of the world's biggest outbreak of Ebola, the World Health Organization acknowledged it was too slow to act, blaming factors including a lack of real-time information and the unprecedented nature of the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But an investigation by The Associated Press has revealed the U.N. health agency knew from the start how unusual the outbreak was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>WHO officials privately floated the idea of declaring an international health emergency in early June, more than a month before the agency maintains it got its first sign the outbreak merited one - in late July - and two months before the declaration was finally made on August 8, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>WHO blamed its slow response partly on a lack of real-time information and the surprising characteristics of the epidemic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In fact it had accurate field reports - including scientists asking for backup - and it identified the unprecedented features of the outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The agency was also hobbled by a shortage of funds and a lack of clear leadership over its country and regional offices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Politics appear to have clouded WHO's willingness to declare an international emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Internal emails and documents suggest the U.N. health agency was afraid of provoking conflict with the Ebola-stricken countries and wary that a declaration could interfere with the economy and the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Ebola-infected WHO consultant in Sierra Leone violated WHO health protocols, creating a rift with Doctors Without Borders that was only resolved when WHO was thrown out of a shared hotel.</td></tr>
