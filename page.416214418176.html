<h3>IBM joins with Apple, J&J in health data venture</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>International Business Machines, deepening its partnership with Apple to make use of health information gathered by millions of Apple devices, is creating a unit dedicated to providing data analytics to the healthcare sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Its new Watson Health unit plans to aggregate health information from a large number of devices and providers in the cloud and offer insights to health companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, which can then integrate results into services they sell to healthcare companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>IBM said it will create headquarters for the unit in Boston with 2,000 employees, including about 75 medical practitioners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>IBM also said it bought two health technology firms, Explorys and Phytel, for an undisclosed amount, to add to its skills in health data analytics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>IBM already has an arrangement to work with Apple on numerous enterprise applications, but is extending its co-operation in the area of health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Watson Health-named for IBM's artificial intelligence creation, which beat previous champions of the U.S. quiz show Jeopardy-will bring cloud services and analytics to Apple's latest forays into the health business, HealthKit and ResearchKit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>HealthKit centralizes a user's health data provided by any number of fitness and health apps on a device, while ResearchKit is an open-source platform that lets researchers create diagnostic apps for use on the iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One example is mPower, which measures hand tremors as a test for Parkinson's Disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both services generate millions of points of data, and with customers' consent, IBM is looking to turn that anonymous data into meaningful signals for the treatment of illnesses or rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Johnson & Johnson, for example, said it will work with IBM on mobile-based coaching systems to help patients before or after surgery and will launch new health apps targeting chronic conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Medical device maker Medtronic said it will use insights from Watson Health and work with IBM on personalized care plans for people with diabetes.</td></tr>
