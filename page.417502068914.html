<tr><td>30</td><td>A few hours later, Versteeg rejoined his teammates in Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has few major problems with his league as the Stanley Cup Final gets underway in a model Sun Belt market, but he took time in his state-of-the-league news conference to address perceived problems with two other warm-weather clubs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Bettman said he believes the Florida Panthers ''are on the absolute right track'' under owner Vincent Viola, dismissing rumors of relocation or bankruptcy as complete fiction.</td></tr>

<tr><td>42</td><td>-The Blackhawks have 17 players who have won a combined 24 Stanley Cup titles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The Lightning have just six players who have appeared in the final, with Valtteri Filppula the only one to win a Cup, with the 2008 Red Wings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>It's about 75 minutes before the opening faceoff of the Stanley Cup Final, and the visiting team's tunnel at Amalie Arena is surrounded by several dozen fans in red Blackhawks jerseys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The same jerseys and their black counterparts already are all over the arena, which just opened its doors several minutes ago.</td></tr>

<tr><td>47</td><td>None of it stopped the Blackhawks' fans from turning out in droves, a development that surprises nobody - not even NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, who has no problem with the policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>''I believe that the Lightning are attempting to create as good a home atmosphere as possible,'' Bettman said before the opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>''The interesting thing is they apparently have the luxury of knowing that the building is sold out, even if they try to limit tickets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Now having said that, any Blackhawk fan that really wants to get into the game can figure out a way to do it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Rocky Wirtz, the Chicago Blackhawks' principal owner and chairman, just arrived at Amalie Arena for the Stanley Cup Final opener along with team President John McDonough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>They stopped to watch a group of Blackhawks playing soccer in the arena hallway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Wirtz is widely credited for kicking off the Blackhawks' current renaissance by abandoning many of his father's longtime policies after Bill Wirtz's death in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>It's almost time for the opening faceoff in Tampa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>The streets and plazas around Amalie Arena began filling with hockey fans several hours before the Lightning took on the Chicago Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Final opener Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Downtown Tampa is festooned with banners, flags, sidewalk stickers and fans supporting the Eastern Conference champions, who are in their first final since 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Dozens of people gathered around a merchandise trailer before it even opened outside the arena on a humid afternoon, hoping to purchase souvenir pucks before they were out of stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Yet dozens of fans in red Blackhawks jerseys already were roaming the Tampa streets on the morning of Game 1, and their numbers will only multiply despite the Lightning's ticketing policies designed to limit the number of road fans in the arena.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Chicago has one of the NHL's best traveling fan bases, and thousands of transplants live within easy driving distance of every Sun Belt NHL city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>''You can't stop Blackhawks fans, so why even try?'' asked Jennifer Smythe, a Schaumburg, Illinois, native now living in Tampa.</td></tr>
