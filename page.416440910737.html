<tr><td>3</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL suspended defensive end Greg Hardy for 10 games without pay Wednesday for conduct detrimental to the league after concluding there was ''credible evidence'' he roughed up his ex-girlfriend nearly a year ago when he was a member of the Carolina Panthers.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Hardy plans to appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Goodell cited ''sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects and with aggravating circumstances.'' His assault case had been dismissed in a North Carolina court because his accuser refused to cooperate with prosecutors, but an NFL investigation concluded that Hardy used physical force against his ex-girlfriend, Nicole Holder, in at least four instances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''The net effect of these acts was that Ms. Holder was severely traumatized and sustained a range of injuries, including bruises and scratches on her neck, shoulders, upper chest, back, arms and feet,'' Goodell wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 26-year-old Hardy was on the commissioner's Exempt List last season and did not play for Carolina, although he was paid his $13.1 million salary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''This suspension is something that we anticipated prior to Greg's signing, and we respect the commissioner's ruling,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Wednesday in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''Our organization understands the very serious nature of this matter.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>-used physical force to shove her against a wall in his apartment's entry hallway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The NFL also concluded that Hardy failed to provide complete and accurate information to investigators and members of the league staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The league said Friel's investigation involved interviews with witnesses and experts; a review of hundreds of pages of court records, documents and exhibits, photographs, police reports, medical records; and reports and opinions of medical experts retained by Hardy's attorneys and by the NFL office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Hardy and his legal counsel, along with representatives of the players' union, met with NFL staff and investigators on March 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hardy and his attorneys also met on March 10 with independent investigators, when, the league said, he had the opportunity to discuss and respond to questions about the events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Holder was not interviewed by the league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Goodell also directed Hardy to have a clinical evaluation conducted and, should counseling or treatment be recommended, Hardy will be expected to comply.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>''You must have no further adverse involvement with law enforcement and must not commit any additional violations of league policies,'' Goodell wrote.</td></tr>
