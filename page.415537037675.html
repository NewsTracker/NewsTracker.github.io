<h3>Tech Fails: What Annoys You Most About Technology</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>We received a few hundred responses via email and social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It turns out many of you have some of the same complaints.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Waiting for Windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Whether it is an update or reboot or whatever, Windows [7] makes you wait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>My time has value but Microsoft doesn't seem to understand that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Updates that slow down your phone, printers that you want to beat with a baseball bat, low battery warnings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>WSJ Personal Technology columnists Geoffrey A. Fowler and Joanna Stern vent their frustrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I've never been able to set up a wireless home network without multiple tech-support calls to both the router manufacturer and ISP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This is why I now pay Time Warner an exorbitant amount of money to set up the network and lease the router.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Notifications!</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It is SO HARD to turn off all of the notifications, and sometimes they inexplicably turn themselves back on, so your phone starts beeping and buzzing in the middle of the night and waking you up!</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>-Linda Bliss, Sandwich, Mass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I would like a clean phone in which I pick the apps, with none pre-installed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I probably use 10% to 15% of the apps/programs on my phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I don't want VZ Navigator, book readers, newsstands, "hangouts," three different browser options, four email options, three app stores, Let us pick at time of purchase what we want on it and skip the rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Apps you can't delete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>You can only bury them deep in a folder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>We know how to download apps already.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Why does Apple need to put a Watch icon on every device [via iOS 8.2 update] months before launch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Unnecessary complexity: Most software programs and devices are built in a sort of nuclear-arms race of features by engineers and business people who seem to have no idea normal people only use 10% of the functions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The ability to automatically block junk and robocalls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It seems odd that one can "white list" and block email addresses but not be able to "white list" telephone numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>When people leave the click noise on so you hear them typing on their phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Websites that don't let you talk to a real person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Makes me nostalgic for the days of being put on perma-hold when I called customer service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>When I am responding to a text message with the letter "k" [as in, "ok"] auto correct replaces the "k" with a capital "I" because it believes I am beginning a sentence and accidentally pressed "k" instead of "I."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Each of my doctors uses his or her own "patient portal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Instead of getting a call or email directly from my doctor's office, I get an email notification that tells me to log in (with a password I never remember!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>and retrieve a message, that more often than not tells me to call their office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Voice mails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Don't leave them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Don't make me stop what I'm doing to listen to a message that I could have read in an SMS or email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>-Greg Schrage, Lenexa, Kan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Why does Apple not give us the ability to mass-delete emails from iPhones and iPads?</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>My wife's niece has a backlog of well over 20,000 emails accumulated on her iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>She is too busy to sit around deleting mails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Nothing makes me more upset when friends or family use their phones at restaurants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The fact that they can't be away from their email or social-media outlets for one to two hours is absolutely absurd!</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Life moves so fast, take moments to actually enjoy real life, NOT virtual life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Obtuse instructions for use of hardware and software is proof of alien life on earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The gaps in critical steps; frustrating help topics; unanswered and ambiguous comments in "FAQ" files; etc. waste more time than any of the [Journal's tech] pet peeves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The help sites that are written by pros who know where everything is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>They refer you to a feature without telling you how to get to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>-Ross Whistler, Needham, Mass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>No one goes through a day without major tech problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>But in gadget ads, someone is on a desert island using all devices and features, all smiles, no glitches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Companies should be required to post a link to the online product forums and state the top problems-just like in drug ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>-Leonard Singer, Overland Park, Kan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The one everyone seems to have missed is the people who think it is some kind of intellectual achievement to be able use the extraneous functions on these idiot proofed devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Is there anything more maddening?</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>For this problem: "Notifications! It is SO HARD to turn off all of the notifications, and sometimes they inexplicably turn themselves back on, so your phone starts beeping and buzzing in the middle of the night and waking you up!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>This seems like an Android problem that is solved with an app called Silence -- and particularly 'Silence Premium', enabling setting of all notifications to shut off and startup based on a calendar/time of day and of week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>@Catherine Marenghi How old is your version of Word?</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>In Word 2010, when you paste you get a pop up box that allows you to select between keeping source formatting, merging formatting, or copying the text only and using the current formatting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Tech Support, in general, is*&^%.I am usually more knowledgeable than the technical "expert" who is seeking to talk me through something I have already done 7 times with no good result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>My favorite was an Amazon call (I have usually found Amazon to be pretty good) wherein the tech support person sent me a link to get the info I needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The link didn't work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>We tried it several times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>I asked if the link was to a public website, or an intranet accessible only to Amazon employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>It took a few minutes, but yes, that link is not open to the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Great. Very helpful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>That's 15 minutes of my life gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Having to charge the mobile devices daily is the most incovenience I have with mobile device technologies: all the speedy hardware and powerful software seem consuming more power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>I'm not as technology literate as I would like to be but a few of these complaints remind me of PEBCAK - Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Seriously, the "take it or leave it" lack of user permission control for Android apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>@Jeffrey Ihnen You buy an Adobe product and then purchase Creative Cloud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Now they make you sign in to use the products you have already paid for.Now you can't use the products you paid for while some other computer is using Creative Cloud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Boo!!</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Hiss!!</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Windows help.Has it ever helped anyone?</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>For wifi and other local network problems, hire a local tech guy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Much simpler and more effective than relying on the service provider.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>The guy you hire is focused on you alone, whereas the help desk is focused on getting rid of you as quickly as possible.</td></tr>
