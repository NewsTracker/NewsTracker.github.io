<h3>After 2 nights of tension, a peaceful protest in Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this Aug. 9, 2015, frame from surveillance video provided by the St. Louis County Police shows the 18-year-old black suspect, center in light colored clothes, minutes before he fired a gun at plainclothes officers, according to police in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tyrone Harris Jr. was shot late Sunday after police say he opened fire on an unmarked police van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The shooting happened as protesters nearby were marking the anniversary of the shooting death of Michael Brown, who was killed by a white police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FERGUSON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police outnumbered protesters along West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson on Tuesday night, signaling the demonstrations around the anniversary of Michael Brown's death could be starting to fade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The crowd of around 100 demonstrators was mostly calm and peaceful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Occasionally a few people would march or chant, but they spent most of several hours milling around and chatting with one another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was a far cry from the violence and tension that marred the previous two nights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Larry Miller, 58, organizer of the protest group Ferguson Freedom Fighters, said it was clear the latest round of demonstrations was dying down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He wasn't convinced much had been accomplished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We already know what needs to be happening is not happening," Miller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We're still bothered over the killing of Mike Brown because we still need police reform, criminal justice system reform."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A tense moment came Tuesday when a few dozen people briefly blocked traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But several officers in riot gear, along with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, quickly moved to break it up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Police said they made no arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The St. Louis suburb has seen demonstrations for days marking the anniversary of Brown's killing on Aug. 9, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Brown, a black 18-year-old, was fatally shot by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice cleared Wilson, but Brown's death spurred a national "Black Lives Matter" movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The events had largely been peaceful until Sunday night, when gunfire erupted and 18-year-old Tyrone Harris Jr. was shot by officers after they say he fired at an unmarked police van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Harris is hospitalized in critical condition and has been charged with 10 felonies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>St. Louis County police on Tuesday released a 13-second clip of security camera footage they say shows Harris minutes before he fired at plainclothes officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The clip shows a person police identify as Harris grabbing a handgun from his waistband and running toward a parking lot, police say in response to the other shots being fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Harris' father disputed the police account Monday but declined to discuss his son's shooting Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The gunfire and Harris' shooting set the city on edge and had protest leaders worried that tensions would escalate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The St. Louis County executive declared a state of emergency Monday, a move that gave Belmar - instead of interim Ferguson Police Chief Andre Anderson - control of security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>On Monday night, the police presence was far greater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Officers lined several blocks of West Florissant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Unlike Sunday, there was no gunfire, no injuries and no reports of looting or property damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Still though, more than 20 people were arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Police never deployed smoke or tear gas, though they were at times pelted with water bottles and rocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>By Tuesday night, there was far less tension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Police said in a statement that at one point, officers reported rocks being thrown at them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>They took no action, and the rock-throwing stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Even when armed members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right anti-government activist group whose presence Belmar has called "both unnecessary and inflammatory," appeared, there was little conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>While one member was being interviewed by media, several protesters gathered around and chanted loud enough to drown him out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Later, several Oath Keepers and protesters argued, but eventually shouting gave way to conversation, and the group parted ways with a pat on the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>John Karriman, an Oath Keepers leader from southwest Missouri, said members plan to remain in Ferguson at least through the end of the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Belmar said the de-escalation over the past two nights was largely due to police work that has been learned in Ferguson since last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"It comes back to experience," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"We look at it as we've seen it before."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>County Executive Steve Stenger said the state of emergency could be lifted as soon as Wednesday.</td></tr>
