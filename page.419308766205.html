<h3>Greece's euro partners approve billions in new loans</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>French Finance Minister Michel Sapin talks to Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos, left, during a meeting of eurozone finance ministers at the EU Council building in Brussels on Friday, Aug. 14, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Finance ministers of the 19-nation euro single currency group on Friday approved the first 26 billion euros ($29 billion) of a vast new bailout package to help rebuild Greece's shattered economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Djisselbloem said that "of course there were differences but we have managed to solve the last issues."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ten billion euros will be made available to recapitalize Greece banks, while a second slice of 16 billion euros will be paid in several installments, starting with a 13 billion euro installment by Aug. 20 when Greece must make a new debt payment to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"On this basis, Greece is and will irreversibly remain a member of the euro area," said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker after the deal was sealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The final rescue package would eventually give Greece up to 86 billion euros ($93 billion) in loans over three years in exchange for harsh spending cuts and tax hikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The deal must still be approved by some national parliaments, including Germany, but that is largely considered to be a formality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some nations, such as Finland, have already given their approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The move saves Greece from a disorderly default on its debts which could have come as soon as next week and helps to cement its membership of Europe's single currency, but means more hardship for ordinary Greeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The approval came after Greece's parliament passed a slew of painful reforms and spending cuts after a marathon overnight session that divided the governing party, raising the specter of early elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The bailout bill passed through the parliament thanks to support from opposition parties, with 222 votes in favor, 64 against, 11 abstentions and three absent in the 300-member parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Although approved by a comfortable majority, the result was a blow to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who saw more than 40 of his 149 radical left Syriza party lawmakers vote against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He has come under intense criticism from party hardliners for capitulating to the creditors' demands for budget cuts - austerity measures he had promised to oppose when he won elections in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The bill includes reforms increasing personal, company and shipping taxes, reducing some pensions, abolishing tax breaks for some groups considered vulnerable and implementing deep spending cuts, including to the armed forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>State television said Tsipras was expected to call a vote of confidence in his government, but that was not confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said any action would come after Aug. 20, when Greece has to make a large debt repayment to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tsipras has maintained his public popularity in Greece despite his U-turn on austerity policies, and consistently leads opposition parties in opinion polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>An election would allow him to remove the hard line elements from his party, but it is not a risk-free option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"An election in the next few months would create more political uncertainty, delay economic recovery and impede reform implementation and the possibility of opening talks on debt relief as desired by the (International Monetary Fund) as a condition of its involvement in funding the program," said Joan Hoey, analyst for Europe at the Economist Intelligence Unit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"However, it appears to be unavoidable if Greece is to have a government capable of implementing the agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Syriza dissenters angrily challenged the government during the all-night parliamentary session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I feel ashamed for you. We no longer have a democracy ... but a eurozone dictatorship," prominent party member and former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis said before the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Lafazanis signed a declaration with another 12 left-wing politicians Thursday saying they would start a new anti-austerity movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He stopped short of quitting Syriza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The terms of the new bailout were agreed earlier this week with creditor negotiators from the European Central Bank, European Commission and IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We took a painful decision of responsibility, and took a step back," Tsipras said in his defense of the bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The IMF still considers Greece's debt to be unsustainable and says the country needs debt relief of some sort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The fund has said it will decide on whether to participate in the new bailout once it has been set up and Greece's European partners have decided on how to ease its debt burden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Many of Greece's euro partners have ruled out a cut to what the country owes them, preferring instead to consider lower interest rates and longer repayment dates on the bailout loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The issue will not be discussed, however, before a first positive review of the new deal is made in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb described it as "a bit of a Catch 22 we need to solve."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The IMF will be involved but only with debt relief, and we want the IMF to be involved but we don't want debt relief," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>OPINION: Did Alexis Tsipras sign his Treaty of Versailles?</td></tr>
