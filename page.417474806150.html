<h3>Microsoft building 2 cloud data centres in Canada</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kevin Turner, COO of Microsoft, with Toronto Mayor John Tory and Ontario Deputy Premier Deb Matthews at an announcement of a new cloud computing centre opening in Toronto Tuesday June 2, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>TORONTO - The Microsoft Cloud is coming to Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Microsoft announced Tuesday that it will build two "Cloud" data centres - one in Toronto and one in Quebec City - next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The data centres will be the physical home to the technology that powers Microsoft's cloud services for businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>How much money is this investment worth and how many jobs?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Microsoft wouldn't say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Where will the data centre be located in Toronto?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>For security reasons, Microsoft wouldn't reveal the actual location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>How does the Microsoft Cloud help a small business?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They don't have to procure data centre space, procure servers or lease servers or run fibre or worry about power or any of those things," explained Kevin Turner, Microsoft's worldwide chief operating officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"All they have to do is begin immediately writing applications and the speed at which to do so is very, very quick. So in a matter of minutes, in an hour, you can be up and developing. You can put a website out there or put applications out there that you can then make available across all platforms in a very, very rapid rate in a very elegant timeframe. It totally takes the responsibility of worrying about internal IT and allows people to innovate on the exterior where people connect with consumers or citizens or businesses and being able to do that and bring it to a global scale."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Why does Microsoft want to locate the cloud in Canada?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Because the centres will be located on Canadian soil, Microsoft will comply with data storage compliance rules that may have kept financial services, governments and health-care organizations from signing up for the services in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>What does Mayor John Tory think?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"When a global company of the reputation of Microsoft chooses to make additional investments in Toronto, that's a happy day," Tory said at the announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He estimated 14,000 jobs in Toronto are connected to cloud computing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It opens up a world of possibilities not just for business and for innovators but also for governments to look at ways in which they can make their expenditures more efficient and frankly provide better service to people by using cloud technology," he said.</td></tr>
