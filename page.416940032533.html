<h3>Nurse in Italy tests positive for Ebola; was in Sierra Leone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ROME (AP) - Italy's health ministry says a nurse who came to Italy from Sierra Leone last week has tested positive for the Ebola virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ministry said a blood sample was sent to Rome for testing Tuesday from Sardinia, where the nurse had arrived on May 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The nurse, who wasn't identified to protect his privacy, worked for the non-governmental aid group Emergency in Sierra Leone, one of the African countries hardest hit by often-fatal Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The ministry said the nurse noticed the first symptoms on Sunday evening and was admitted to the infectious disease ward of Sassari hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He will soon be transferred to Rome's Spallanzani infectious disease hospital, which last year successfully treated an Italian doctor who contracted Ebola after working in Sierra Leone, also for Emergency.</td></tr>
