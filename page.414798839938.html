<h3>Here's Why Surveyors Just Discovered That The Washington Monument Is Shorter Than They Thought</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Government surveyors have determined a new height for the Washington Monument that's nearly 10 inches shorter than what has been recorded for more than 130 years, officials said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new measurement puts the monument at 554 feet, 7 and eleven-thirty-seconds of an inch, as measured from the floor of the main entrance to the top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ever since the stone obelisk was completed in 1884, however, the historic height has been recorded at 555 feet, 5 and 1/8 inches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It's a number circulated for decades on tours of the capital and in civics classes about the monument honoring the nation's first president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>So could this be a case of an incredible shrinking monument?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Has it sunk into the ground more than previously thought?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>No, not even close, said the chief scientist at the National Geodetic Survey, which conducted the measurement with accuracy to within one millimeter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Modern international standards from the Council of Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat - an official guideline for building measurements - call for a different base point than what was likely used in the 1880s, said Dru Smith, chief geodesist with the National Geodetic Survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This standard measures from the lowest open-air pedestrian entrance to the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The building didn't change height because of anything; it is just where you start from," Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The original measurement conducted in 1884 by Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Thomas Casey is believed to have used four brass markers as a base for measurement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Those markers remain in place about 9 inches below ground off each corner of the monument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's possible the markers were at ground level in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A new plaza was installed around the monument more recently, and "it's clear that what was ground level has changed over the years," Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Measurements from the brass markers to the top in 1999 and 2014 essentially reconfirmed the original measurement, showing the 1884 measurement was done with "incredible accuracy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The only observable height change was the pyramid-shaped tip had been rounded off over time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Surveyors in 1934 also noticed the peak had been rounded and believed it was due to frequent lightning strikes that melted the aluminum tip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Well, this time around, we took very careful measurements," Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We were able to determine about 3/8 of an inch had been melted off from the very top."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That means the original 1884 measurement, completed with much less sophisticated equipment, was within of an inch of the findings from the newest survey, using the original brass markers as a base point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It's remarkable, quite honestly, that they had the ability to get such an accurate measurement back in that time," Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>When the monument was completed in 1884, it was the world's tallest structure until 1889 when the Eiffel Tower was built.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It remains by far the tallest structure in the nation's capital, which strictly restricts building heights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Most buildings are shorter than the U.S. Capitol dome, which rises 288 feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The new survey was conducted while the monument was wrapped in scaffolding for restoration work following a 2011 earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Earlier survey results showed the monument did not sink any further into the ground as a result of the 5.8-magnitude earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The monument was built on land that used to be underwater, and it has sunk about 2.2 inches since 1901.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Lest anyone be confused by the changing measurements, the National Park Service as caretaker of the monument has no intention of changing its brochures or description of the height to reflect the new numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"For our purposes we'll still use the historic height rather than the architectural height, since they're measured from different places," said spokeswoman Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The extensive survey will give the Park Service new data as a baseline to track any changes in the monument's height, tilt or compression in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The National Geodetic Survey and National Park Service revealed the survey results on Presidents Day, which also celebrates Washington's birthday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I think we can all agree the significance of the Washington Monument is really far greater than the architectural qualities or even its height," said Mike Commisso, a cultural resources specialist for the National Mall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"It continues to serve as a memorial to one of the most influential and prominent public figures in our nation's history."</td></tr>

<h3>A look at the Islamic State group's reach into North Africa</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Militants in several countries - including Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Yemen and Saudi Arabia - have pledged allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, although the degree of coordination and operational planning between IS leadership and the group's affiliates remains unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- The country has been in free-fall since the end of the civil war that ousted longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Libya's elected government has relocated to the far eastern part of the country, while a loose alliance of militias have set up a rival government in the capital, Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fighting between government forces and Islamic militias rages in the second largest city of Benghazi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, embassies have shuttered and diplomats have fled the country, along with hundreds of thousands of foreign laborers, many of them Egyptian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This chaos has proven fertile ground for IS, which has received pledges of allegiance from several extremist factions in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>IS-affiliated groups divide the vast, oil-rich country of 6 million people into three regions: Tripoli, Barqa or Cyrenaica in the east, and Fazzan in the south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The interior minister of Libya's elected government, Omar al-Sinki, has said that al-Baghdadi appointed a Tunisian named Abu Talha to lead the IS faction in Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Al-Sinki also has said that the bulk of IS militants in Libya are Tunisian and Yemeni.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to postings on jihadi web forums, groups claiming allegiance to IS control the coastal cities of Sirte and Darna, and have a presence in at least three other locales, including Tripoli and Benghazi, the birthplace of Libya's 2011 uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Egyptian warplanes struck suspected IS targets in Darna on Monday, following the killing of the 21 Coptic Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Militants claiming allegiance to IS have battled Libyan troops in Benghazi, often using suicide bombers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Last month, fighters loyal to IS claimed responsibility for a deadly and complex attack on a hotel in Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>- The Egyptian government is battling a burgeoning insurgency centered in the strategic Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel and the Gaza Strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>North Sinai has seen a spike in militant attacks against security forces, particularly after the military ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The area has been under a dusk-to-dawn curfew since October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some militants there have declared their allegiance to IS, with one such group calling itself Sinai Province of the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It claimed responsibility for a sophisticated and multi-pronged set of attacks late last month on Egyptian military positions that killed 32 troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Last October, another major attack killed more than 30 troops, and last month Sinai Province militants claimed responsibility for the capture and killing of a police captain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Sinai Province, which grew out of the al-Qaida-inspired group known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, has not attacked civilians directly, although some have died as a result of its violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Extremist groups in Sinai rely heavily on weapons smuggled across the porous desert border with Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Despite more than a year of massive military operations in northern Sinai, which have included home demolitions along the frontier, the government has not been able to stem a daily stream of militant attacks there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>- The Islamic State group's successes in Syria have inspired a number of radical Islamist groups to splinter away from the dominant North African branch of al-Qaida, known as AQIM, and declare allegiance to al-Baghdadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Most prominent has been the Algerian Soldiers of the Caliphate (Jund al-Khilafah) led by a veteran al-Qaida commander that kidnapped French hiker Herve Gourdel in September and then put out a video showing his beheading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Algeria unleashed a massive operation against the group last fall, and most of its known members have since been captured or killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In Tunisia, the radical Oqba ibn Nafaa brigade has long had good relations with AQIM, but has also issued statements in support of IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>More importantly, however, there has been a steady flow of Tunisian recruits to al-Baghdadi's group, most passing through Libya for training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Increasingly, they have stayed there and fought with an alliance of Islamist militias as well as the Islamic State, and report have emerged of several Tunisian "martyrs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>WHAT THREAT DOES THIS POSE TO EUROPE?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>- European states have looked on with growing alarm as militants with links to IS have risen in prominence across North Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Italy, which is just 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the Libyan coast, has been perhaps the most concerned by the extremists' surge in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Italian authorities fear that Islamic militants might slip into the country on Libya-based smuggling boats crowded with refugees and migrants from Syria, Africa and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Italian Premier Matteo Renzi has even gone so far as to press for U.N. intervention to stem the violence in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>On Sunday, Italy repatriated by sea its personnel from its Tripoli embassy and advised other Italians, many of whom work in oil or construction businesses, to leave Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Fears about the IS threat are also running high in France, which has seen more people join extremists in Syria and Iraq than any other European country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Some 1,400 French citizens or residents have been identified as linked to jihadi networks in recent years, hundreds of whom have traveled to Syria or Iraq, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>French authorities are particularly concerned that IS-linked extremists will stage attacks at home, and are trying to toughen counterterrorism laws and tools to stop them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>A Frenchman who killed four people at a Paris kosher market last month, Amedy Coulibaly, claimed ties to IS, and the group said last week that Coulibaly's girlfriend has joined IS in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Another Frenchman with ties to IS, Mehdi Nemmouche, is the chief suspect in a deadly attack on the Brussels Jewish Museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>IS in recent months has started a monthly online magazine in French and have released multiple online videos in French urging French Muslims to join jihad in the Mideast - and if they can't, to stage attacks at home.</td></tr>
