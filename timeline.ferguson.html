<li>Year later, AP reporter recalls origins of Ferguson movement</li>
<li>ST. LOUIS (AP) - EDITOR'S NOTE - A year ago, most Americans had never heard of the St. Louis suburb called Ferguson.</li>
<li>Until August 2014, Ferguson, Missouri, wasn't the kind of place that generated much news.</li>
<li>My wife's grandmother lived in Ferguson until she died in 1991, so I spent some time there as a young man.</li>
<li>But since joining the St. Louis office of The Associated Press in 1993, I had never been to Ferguson as a reporter.</li>
<li>The next day, as Ferguson police prepared for a news conference to explain what happened, I was among a crowd of reporters who heard distant chanting.</li>
<li>Never before had the anger been as intense as in Ferguson.</li>
