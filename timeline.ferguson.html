<li>The investigation into the police department began in August after the shooting of unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson sparked national protests.</li>
<li>The department will use the findings to negotiate policy changes with Ferguson officials and enter a consent decree, or to sue the city to force change.</li>
<li>The report's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in Ferguson.</li>
<li>But they are unlikely to restore full trust in the Ferguson police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict Brown's killer, officer Darren Wilson.</li>
<li>Civil rights attorney Jerryl Christmas, who has represented people who have clashed with Ferguson police and city officials, said he was not surprised by the findings, and he hopes to see Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson fired.</li>
<li>The official said that in Ferguson's court system, African-Americans were less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and made up 95 percent of people held longer than two days in the Ferguson jail.</li>
