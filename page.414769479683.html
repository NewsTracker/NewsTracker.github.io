<h3>Family of three - and their dog - ditch rental home for 800sq ft tiny house that costs just $20,000 and can barely fit a microwave oven</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Their diminutive home on wheels, which is nearing completion, will hardly leave room to stretch out for Cori Cox, 37, his wife Angel Tyra, 33, their eight-year-old daughter, Amelia, and Dexter, their 60lbs dog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The dwelling, which measures eight feet by twenty feet, features living space, bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen, but minimized to the extreme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The change has seen Tyra throw out her shoe collection, and Amelia donate most of her toys to charity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The family has thrown out their beds, TV and any bulky furniture that would not survive the downsizing, according to the Indiana Star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It has cost them just $20,000 to build the house, which is nearing completion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Their kitchen will have space for a shrunken refrigerator and an oven the same size as a microwave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tyra said she was skeptical at first, but came round to the idea later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She said: 'When [Cori] first brought the idea to me, I said, "you're totally out of your mind... nobody lives like that. We can't do that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But she came round to the idea - and the family is now expected to reap a huge saving from it - with their montly utility bill slashed to just $50 and the price of the property itself shrunk dramatically thanks to their own hard work building it.</td></tr>
