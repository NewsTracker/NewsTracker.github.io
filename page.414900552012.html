<h3>Undertaker says no word on Bali Nine pair</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran remain on death row in Bali after plans to move them to Nusakambangan island for their executions stalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo says no new date for the move has been set, with agencies still planning the movement of prisoners for the mass execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Besides the Bali Nine duo, seven other drug offenders on death row are in line for execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attorney-general's department says also that Nusakambangan island, home to several prisons off Central Java, does not have adequate isolation cells.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And the funeral director at Javanese Christian Church in Cilacap, the nearest mainland town to Nusakambangan, says he has not yet been told to prepare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Suhendro Putro says he's ordering extra coffins anyway after having to scramble to fill the police order last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Five drug offenders were executed on January 18, but Mr Suhendro had only three coffins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was also asked to find more people to help prepare the bodies for burial, including one familiar with Buddhist funeral rites, and ambulances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As of Friday, he hadn't been told to get ready for more executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"What can I say? I haven't been told. I am usually told," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The coffins are ordered from the city of Yogyakarta and it takes time, Mr Suhendro said, "so they can't tell me all of a sudden".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There has been speculation that the executions could be delayed for up to a month, after a spokesman for Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla was quoted in local media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Kalla took a phone call on Thursday from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the transfer, enabling Chan and Sukumaran to spend more time with family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>According to his spokesman, Husain Abdullah, Mr Kalla told Ms Bishop the executions had been delayed "three weeks to one month" because of technical issues, some local media reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, Ms Bishop and Mr Prasetyo deny the length of the delay was discussed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At Kerobokan jail on Friday, meetings to plan the transfer to Nusakambangan jail continued, but no date was set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"As soon as Nusakambangan is ready, we'll send them immediately," Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told reporters.</td></tr>
