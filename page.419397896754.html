<h3>Greek government relaxes some restriction on money transactions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - The Greek government has relaxed slightly its restrictions on banking transactions, allowing small amounts to be sent abroad for the first time in about two months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The finance ministry's amendments, published in the government gazette overnight Monday to Tuesday, include allowing Greeks to send up to 500 euros ($555) abroad per person per month, and allowing up to 8,000 euros per quarter to be sent to students studying abroad to cover accommodation costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greeks can now also open new bank accounts that will have no withdrawal rights, in order to repay loans, social security contributions or tax debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The government restricted banking transactions in late June to prevent a bank run after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced a referendum on creditors' terms for a new bailout.</td></tr>
