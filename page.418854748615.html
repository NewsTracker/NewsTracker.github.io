<h3>Trial set for New Mexico man who threw banana peel at Dave Chappelle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This Sunday, July 6, 2014 file photo Dave Chappelle performs at the Essence Festival in New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>SANTA FE, N.M. -- The man accused of throwing a banana peel at comedian Dave Chappelle during a New Mexico performance is headed to court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Assistant District Attorney Anastasia Martin told the Santa Fe New Mexican Monday that jury selection is scheduled for Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>23 for the trial of Christian Englander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Englander, 31, who is white, has been charged with disturbing the peace and battery after the fruit-throwing disturbance in March while Chappelle was onstage at the Lensic Performing Arts Center in Santa Fe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Englander had acknowledged throwing a peel from a banana he had eaten earlier because he took offence to jokes that Chappelle, who is African-American, made about his companion, according to police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The friend reportedly was drawing in a sketchbook during the show when Chappelle noticed and asked the man his name, which he gave as "Johnny Appleseed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chappelle then made jokes about the moniker, and police say that's why Englander got upset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If I can, I would like to avoid a trial," Englander said Monday following a brief hearing before Judge Donita Sena in Magistrate Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I'm not afraid of the end result, but it's a waste of human resources."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Englander said there are "real criminals out there that they can try. If there is a plea offering, I'll take it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Englander's attorney, Roderick Thompson, said while there is always the possibility of a plea bargain, he could not say more about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The case has taken on racial overtones and attracted widespread attention after Chappelle said throwing the banana peel was a racist act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Englander said Monday that after the police apprehended him on March 30, Chappelle came to the police station to interrogate him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There Chappelle asked him, "Don't you know bananas are racist?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Englander said he told Chappelle, 41, he did not agree and that Chappelle then responded with profanity-laced insults about Englander and his mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Lt. Andrea Dobyns of the Santa Fe Police Department confirmed that Chappelle appeared at the police station that night to talk to Englander.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A representative of the Gersh Agency, which represents Chappelle, declined comment Monday.</td></tr>
