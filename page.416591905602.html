<h3>Australia recalls ambassador to Indonesia over Bali Nine executions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australia will recall its ambassador from Jakarta in the first official reaction to the overnight execution of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan by an Indonesian firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The bodies of the Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have left the Indonesian island where they were executed overnight, leaving their families to contemplate a lifetime of grief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Just after midnight (0325 AEST), on the prison island of Nusakambangan, the Australian men were shot dead alongside six other drug offenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Australian men's families say they are broken, and Indonesia's steadfast refusal to spare the men has sentenced them to endless pain and grief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The futility of years of legal appeals and challenges was evident in the words of Chan and Sukumaran's Indonesian lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis, who tweeted: "I am sorry. I failed. I lost."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The killings have sparked rage and grief in Australia, amid reports some of the families gathered at Cilacap, across the water from Nusakambangan, heard the shots that killed their loved ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Australia will recall its ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Grigson, in an unprecedented move to convey its anger to its northern neighbour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"These two families have suffered an appalling tragedy," Prime Minister Tony Abbott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the families had been left in a "devastating position".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Their deaths are senseless," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A grim convoy of ambulances arrived on a ferry in Cilacap, before heading to Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Empty coffins sent over a few days ago have returned carrying the bodies of the eight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Australian officials are with the Chan and Sukumaran families, and Ms Bishop said it would be their job to see the bodies returned, with the respect and dignity they deserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer Peter Morrissey said the Australians had died with dignity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's awful, I know, but the two boys died well. They made their preparations, they were dignified. They're strong against the death penalty, they were supportive of their families," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They tasted how awful this would be," he said, referring to executions carried out in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The others executed were Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, Nigerians Sylvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Raheem Agbaje Salami and Okwudili Oyatanze, and Ghanaian Martin Anderson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The executions have sparked a wave of international condemnation, and Australian politicians are vowing to use the deaths of Chan and Sukumaran to push all nations to abolish the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The international community must renew its resolve to rid the world of this barbaric practice, and Australia should stand ready to lead this work," Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and shadow foreign affairs minister Tanya Plibersek said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Amnesty International has called on Indonesia to understand the world's majority position on the death penalty has shifted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"End the death penalty and join the international trend to abolish the inhuman, cruel and degrading practice," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott has sought to tread a fine diplomatic line as he expresses Australia's official anger at the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Bali Nine ringleaders were among seven foreign nationals and one Indonesian shot dead by firing squad on the island of Nusakambangan early Wednesday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>With Foreign Minister Julie Bishop by his side at Parliament House in Canberra hours later, a grave Mr Abbott described the executions as both cruel and unnecessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>While he respected Indonesia's sovereign right to uphold tough domestic laws against drug smugglers, the prime minister said it could not be business as usual between Canberra and Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>For that reason Australia's ambassador Paul Grigson will be recalled for consultations with the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The husband of pastor Christie Buckingham says Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran sang songs of praise as they walked onto the killing field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A ferry carrying the bodies of the eight men executed by Indonesia early on Wednesday has returned to Cilacap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the executions of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were cruel and unnecessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Flowers have been laid outside the home of Andrew Chan's parents in Sydney just hours after the two Australian Bali Nine drug smugglers were executed.</td></tr>
