<h3>Europe pushes Greece in bogged-down debt talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>RIGA - European ministers heaped pressure on Greece on Friday to speed up negotiations to unblock critically needed bailout funds and avert a dangerous default, showing frustration after months of bogged down talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The eurozone's 19 finance ministers ended a meeting in Riga without a breakthrough to unlock 7.2 billion ($7.8 billion) in bailout cash, with the threat of a messy exit by Greece from the euro still hanging in the balance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It was a very critical discussion," said Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem after the talks ended, with eurozone ministers angry at the lack of progress as a hefty payment of 200 million to the IMF stands due on May 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There remain big, big problems to be solved for Greece," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Athens is fast running out of money to pay its creditors and carry out everyday government duties, raising the risk of a default as a long series of huge loan repayments to the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Friday, Greece's parliament adopted a controversial decree ordering all public institutions to hand over their cash reserves to the central bank to help Athens pay civil servants' wages and service its debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But increasingly irate eurozone ministers have refused to release any cash without a comprehensive list of reforms that the hard-left Syriza government has so far refused to accept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greece's Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said the talks in Riga were heated but pointed the finger to mixed messages from his European partners, all while adding that a deal was within reach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The cost of not finding an agreement would be enormous," Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Emphasizing the dangerous line Athens is walking, ECB chief Mario Draghi, also at the talks, again evoked the possibility of pulling back emergency financing to Greece's crippled banks, a lifeline to the Greek economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greek officials and Athens' international creditors have been locked in technical discussions over the reforms Greece must adopt in exchange for the funds, with a deadline originally set for the end of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However, ministers said this process was showing its limits and that the negotiations needed a new approach, which some reports said would mean relocating the talks back to Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Varoufakis dismissed the idea, arguing the Greek people would interpret it as a return of the dreaded "troika" of auditors who oversaw the bailout program before the radical leftists took power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The notion that we go back to the troika is simply groundless," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Greece's radical-left Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras swept to power in January on a promise to break with austerity demanded by its EU and IMF creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Defying his paymasters, Tsipras pushed welfare laws through parliament last month and has continued to refuse measures agreed on by the previous government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The anti-austerity measures have angered creditors, but in a blog posted on Friday, Varoufakis said differences with the eurozone could be resolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The current disagreements with our partners are not unbridgeable," Varoufakis said, adding a list of potential compromises on some of the thorniest issues such as pension reforms and privatizations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At an EU summit on Thursday, Tsipras and Chancellor Angela Merkel of economic powerhouse Germany briefly discussed the standoff, though little emerged from the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>With no deal in Riga, expectations now shift to the next Eurogroup talks on May 11, on the eve of another hefty debt repayment by Greece to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>However, European officials are increasingly floating the end of June as the true deadline for Greece, when the current 240 billion euro program expires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"The crucial moment is the end of June. No one believes in prolonging the current program," said French Finance Minister Michel Sapin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The real question is what happens afterwards."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But Dijsselbloem said it was too early to look that far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It's very hard to talk about the future if you can't get through the next four months," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>For now, the idea that Greece will crash out of the eurozone remains the less likely scenario for officials, though the tense talks will increase fears of major problems ahead.</td></tr>
