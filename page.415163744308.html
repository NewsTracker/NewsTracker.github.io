<h3>Security cameras at Boris Nemtsov murder scene 'switched off'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Roland Oliphant reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A makeshift memorial at the site where Boris Nemtsov was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Moscow: Security cameras did not record the assassination of Boris Nemtsov because they were being "repaired", it was claimed on Monday, as his Ukrainian girlfriend complained that she is now effectively under house arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Cameras overlooking the murder scene on the Bolshoi Moskvoretsky bridge in Moscow could have provided crucial evidence about the killer, the getaway vehicle, and about how the attack was planned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Russia's Kommersant newspaper reported that cameras, in a heavily policed area of Moscow just outside the Kremlin, happened to have been switched off for "repair work" when Mr Nemtsov was shot on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Moscow city authorities later denied the accusations, and said that their cameras were in working order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Federal Guards Service, the agency responsible for Kremlin security, said none of its cameras had captured the crime because they faced inwards towards the Kremlin walls, not outwards to where Mr Nemtsov was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Nemtsov, 55, an opposition politician who had once been deputy prime minister, was murdered as he walked home from dinner with his 23-year-old Ukrainian girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Boris Nemtsov's girlfriend Anna Duritskaya was with him when he was murdered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In her first public comments, Ms Duritskaya said she was effectively under house arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Describing the attack, in which she was unharmed, she told Russia's independent Dozhd television station: "I did not notice anything suspicious. I do not know [where the murderer came from]. I did not see because it happened behind me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She said she was being made to stay in Moscow by investigators, who had warned her it could be dangerous to leave even though she had given all the evidence she had to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I do not understand why I am still on Russian territory," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In a further twist, Kommersant also reported that details about the murder weapon had led investigators to consider the possibility that the killers were amateurs, not the highly professional assassins as first thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Six empty 9mm cartridges fired at the scene were from different manufacturers and the oldest dated back to 1986, the newspaper reported.</td></tr>
