<h3>Islamic extremist group al-Shabab suspected in northern Kenya attack that kills 1, wounds 3</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The official, who insisted on anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak with the media, said the victims were believed to be non-Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attack comes two days after gunmen attacked the convoy of Mandera Gov. Ali Roba, killing four people including two policemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Roba survived the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Adan Duale, a Kenyan Somali who is majority leader in parliament, was quoted on the BBC Somali Service on Saturday telling al-Shabab to leave Kenya alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"If you wish to, we shall send you elders, religious leaders and politicians. We shall come, tell us your whereabouts. Leave Kenya alone," Duale said in a statement that many in Kenya interpreted as a call for negotiations with al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Duale said Sunday on his Twitter account that Kenya will never negotiate with "terrorists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Al-Shabab, based in Somalia, has vowed to inflict violent attacks on Kenya because it has contributed troops to the African Union force supporting the Western-backed government in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kenya has experienced a string of attacks since it sent troops into Somalia in October 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Police said last month that 312 people have been killed in extremist attacks since 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In October, Roba's convoy was hit by an improvised explosive device as he was being driven to work, injuring one of his guards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In November, al-Shabab fighters hijacked a bus near Mandera, singled out non-Muslims and non-Somalis, and shot dead 28 passengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Twenty-two of those killed were teachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ten days later, al-Shabab massacred 36 quarry workers who were non-Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hundreds of teachers in parts of northern Kenya that border Somalia have refused to return to work, fearing attacks despite government reassurance of increased security.</td></tr>

<h3>?On the Twentieth Century' review: Blissful Broadway revival</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>That's where the Roundabout revival of "On the Twentieth Century," directed with verve by Scott Ellis, takes you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But that's nothing compared to the practically nuclear glow that comes off Kristin Chenoweth, whose singular talent and skills are tailor-made for a role originated on Broadway in 1978 by Madeline Kahn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chenoweth is a stick of blond dynamite, a virtuoso comedian and singer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She uses her petite body, ample bosom and middle finger for a laugh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She hits every high C in the joyous and eclectic score that pushes the plot along expertly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>As Mildred Plotka, Chenoweth is a nobody, an audition pianist plunking out a living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She morphs into Lily Garland, an Oscar-winning glamour girl ever-fetching in stunning gowns - trimmed with lace and wit by William Ivey Long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She gets there with help from the powerful theater producer and sometime lover Oscar Jaffe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Now Oscar, played by Peter Gallagher with just the right egomaniacal spin and scary glint in his eye, is broke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He needs Lily for his next project about Mary Magdalene, so he books a neighboring compartment on the train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But a rival producer, Max Jacobs (James Moye) wants Lily for his project about high society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Which will Lily choose?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That sets up one of a few elaborate and hysterical production numbers ingeniously choreographed by Warren Carlyle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Four tap-dancing porters add their own percussive and precise delight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Lending sterling support as Oscar's right-hand "musketeers" are Mark Linn-Baker and Michael McGrath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mary Louise Wilson lets her inner rascal out as a fanatical, off-kilter millionaire who promises to back Oscar's movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And Andy Karl (remember him as the best thing about "Rocky"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the show's title song, it comes out that the Twentieth Century famously gives passengers "nothing but the best."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This production, fizzy and dizzy entertainment, does likewise.</td></tr>
