<h3>Islamic extremist group al-Shabab suspected in northern Kenya attack that kills 1, wounds 3</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The official, who insisted on anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak with the media, said the victims were believed to be non-Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attack comes two days after gunmen attacked the convoy of Mandera Gov. Ali Roba, killing four people including two policemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Roba survived the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Adan Duale, a Kenyan Somali who is majority leader in parliament, was quoted on the BBC Somali Service on Saturday telling al-Shabab to leave Kenya alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"If you wish to, we shall send you elders, religious leaders and politicians. We shall come, tell us your whereabouts. Leave Kenya alone," Duale said in a statement that many in Kenya interpreted as a call for negotiations with al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Duale said Sunday on his Twitter account that Kenya will never negotiate with "terrorists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Al-Shabab, based in Somalia, has vowed to inflict violent attacks on Kenya because it has contributed troops to the African Union force supporting the Western-backed government in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kenya has experienced a string of attacks since it sent troops into Somalia in October 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Police said last month that 312 people have been killed in extremist attacks since 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In October, Roba's convoy was hit by an improvised explosive device as he was being driven to work, injuring one of his guards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In November, al-Shabab fighters hijacked a bus near Mandera, singled out non-Muslims and non-Somalis, and shot dead 28 passengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Twenty-two of those killed were teachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ten days later, al-Shabab massacred 36 quarry workers who were non-Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hundreds of teachers in parts of northern Kenya that border Somalia have refused to return to work, fearing attacks despite government reassurance of increased security.</td></tr>
