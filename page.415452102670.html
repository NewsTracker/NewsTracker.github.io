<h3>Mayor says NYC jail change years away amid multiple reforms</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Since those interviews, the full depth of the problems plaguing the sprawling Rikers Island jail complex - from guard brutality to shoddy treatment of the mentally ill - have been exposed by reporters, prosecutors and regulators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But officials say before true reform takes root even more structural shortcomings must be addressed: At the top of the list is the fact that nearly half of the 9,000 correction officers have fewer than five years on the job - and the entire workforce needs to be retrained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Sustained change, obviously, will take several years," de Blasio said last week at a Rikers news conference dedicated to curbing inmate violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"But I think you're going to see progress soon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The mayor and his jails commissioner, Joseph Ponte, who is credited with overhauling disorderly lockups from Massachusetts to Memphis, declined to identify specific benchmarks of reform but acknowledged there is plenty of work to be done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In addition to retraining a largely inexperienced workforce, Ponte has said that all 35 members of the gang intelligence unit need to go through a new 80-hour training course so that they're as competent as top police detectives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Such training is designed to help guards understand jailhouse gang feuds and root out contraband, including drugs and surgical scalpels that have been used in many slashings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The department's workforce is so inexperienced in large part because of years of a virtually nonexistent recruitment policy combined with high turnover rates among frustrated staff as the neglected department deteriorated over the years, officials say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A recently recruited class of 400 jail guards is the most well-vetted in years and an even larger class is currently being recruited to be hired this summer, Ponte said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Our focus has been one facility at a time," Ponte said of his reforms at the 10-jail complex last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 11,000-inmate jail system first came under scrutiny after The Associated Press detailed the horrifying deaths of two mentally ill inmates at Rikers last year, highlighting the difficulties of treating the surging numbers of the mentally ill who occupy the jails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In New York, about 40 percent of all inmates have a mental health diagnosis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More attention has since been paid to violence as well as the use of force against inmates by jail guards which has continued to rise despite a scathing federal review last summer that found a "deep-seated" culture of violence in a Rikers youth jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>De Blasio said this week Rikers' problems were decades in the making but won't take as long to undo, invoking the scandals of police corruption in the 1970s exposed by the Knapp Commission and eventually solved over time with increased resources, oversight and new leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Eugene O'Donnell, a former NYPD officer and prosecutor who now teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the comparison rings true in at least one respect - reforming the culture of a top-down paramilitary agency from the outside will require tackling the groupthink of officers and managers alike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Sometimes the people inside the organization don't realize that their logic is illogical and what they've come to believe is a bedrock truth, an outside observer then comes in and marvels at," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"There's a benefit of having outsiders come in but there's also a cost which is that solutions can have unintended consequences."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That's a point some union officials make when discussing de Blasio's efforts to eliminate solitary confinement for 16- and 17-year-old inmates and phase out its use for 18- to 21-year-olds by the beginning of next year, arguing they've been deprived a key tool to manage unruly inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Inmate advocates similarly argue that a new restrictive housing unit for violence-prone inmates and potential restrictions to visitors will only fuel jailhouse tension.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt sacks 41 judges for supporting the Brotherhood: sources</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian disciplinary court ordered 41 judges into compulsory retirement on Saturday for supporting the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, judicial sources said, the latest move in a sweeping crackdown on political dissent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The government has implemented a harsh crackdown on Islamists and secular political opponents since July 2013, when then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi following mass protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Disciplinary Council headed by Nabil Zaki, a judge, did not immediately release the reason for its decision, but the judicial sources said 31 of the judges were sent into compulsory retirement for signing a statement condemning Mursi's removal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Another 10 were removed from their posts for joining the "Judges for Egypt" group, which supported the Brotherhood even before Mursi's removal, the sources added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egyptian law prohibits judges from engaging in politics, but critics and human rights groups say the judicial disciplinary court has turned a blind eye to judges who openly support the government of Sisi, who was elected president last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The government says the judiciary is independent and it never intervenes in its work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The decision is shocking and it is a massacre of the judges," Ahmed El-Khatib, one of the punished judges, told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He made no comment about whether he supported the Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The judges have the right to appeal the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Separately, security forces arrested 63 middle-level Brotherhood leaders who face charges of attacking police headquarters and inciting violence, Egypt's interior ministry said in a statement on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Another 13 Brotherhood supporters were arrested on suspicion of possessing arms and ammunition, it added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The government has banned the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, and Sisi says it is a threat to national security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The group says it is committed to peaceful activism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Egyptian security forces face a militant insurgency that has killed hundreds of soldiers and police since Mursi was ousted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The attacks are mostly concentrated in North Sinai, the center of an insurgency by militants seeking to topple the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But frequent small-scale attacks in Cairo and other regions have damaged Egypt's efforts to project an image of stability after four years of turmoil triggered by the 2011 uprising that deposed veteran ruler Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A homemade bomb wounded four people outside an HSBC bank branch east of the coastal city of Alexandria on Saturday morning, security sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Another bomb later exploded outside a courthouse in the center of the port city, wounding two people and damaging the front of the building, security and medical sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The attacks came on the second day of a three-day investment conference in the resort town Sharm el-Sheikh that Egypt hopes will project an image of stability and attract billions of dollars.</td></tr>
