<h3>Guy Who Gets Paid to Say Obamacare Doesn?t Work Can?t Find a Single True Fact to Support His Case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Measured by volume, the right-wing backlash has diminished severely, as great roaring waves of furious anger have given way to irregular ripples of discontent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But measured by its content, very little has changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Conservatives are talking much less than they used to about Obamacare, but they are saying more or less the same things, treating the law as a costly and obvious failure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What's most striking is how oblivious most of them remain not only to measures of the law's success, but even to the broad parameters of its objectives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>To take a typical example, here is Stephen Moore, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, making his case, such as it is, that Obamacare has failed to meet its cost targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Perhaps the most revealing aspect of Moore's column is the fact that, five years after its passage, the chief economist of the most influential conservative think tank in the United States lacks even a passing familiarity with its fiscal objectives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Obamacare has two fiscal goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The first is to pay for its expanded coverage with a combination of spending cuts and higher taxes, so that the net effect is to reduce the deficit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The second, and more ambitious, goal is to change the incentives of the health-care system to gradually bring down health-care inflation (a goal health-care wonks have called "bending the curve").</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Moore's column, which I am excerpting in its entirety, makes clear he does not understand either target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If there were a contest for the biggest lie in Washington over the past 30 years, it would be hard to compete with President Obama's boast that he would put 30 million more Americans on Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies, and this would reduce the budget deficit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That's got to be right up there with President Clinton declaring, "I did not have sexual relations with that woman."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A new Congressional Budget Office report has blown the lid off the Obama whopper fib.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Keep in mind what Moore is claiming here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Obama promised that the ACA would reduce the deficit, and according to Moore, the Congressional Budget Office has a new report showing this promise was false.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If true, this would be enormous news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In fact, no such finding exists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>CBO originally estimated that Obamacare would reduce the deficit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It correspondingly estimated for the next several years that repealing the law would increase the deficit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>CBO stopped issuing cost estimates of the overall law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It did, however, report that its estimate of the law's gross costs - the spending on coverage - has been falling, rather than rising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Congressional Budget Office reports that through the first four months of fiscal 2015, federal spending is rising at an 8.2 percent clip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Most components of spending are relatively flat and national defense outlays - the most important function of government - are falling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Still, one area accounts for almost the entire budget blowout: Obamacare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Medicaid spending is up a stratospheric 23 percent so far this year thanks to massive new enrollments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In addition, the $7 billion in Obamacare "exchange subsidies" so far this year brings the rise in costs of the "Affordable" Care Act to nearly 30 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In one year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>And in an era of almost no inflation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Obamacare has turned out to be, just as feared, the largest expansion of government since the Great Society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Notice the switch here?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Moore began his column by claiming that the CBO has proven that it's a "lie" that Obamacare would reduce the deficit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But the data he provides does not remotely prove this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It merely shows that federal spending on Medicaid and exchange subsidies - that is, Obamacare - is up in 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That is completely different than saying Obamacare has increased the deficit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Indeed, the design of Obamacare all along was to spend money to cover the uninsured, and to cover the cost of this new spending with a combination of spending cuts and higher taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>There is nothing in Moore's column to indicate he even understands this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>This stampede of rising health costs was so predictable that most budget experts acknowledged - even liberals, privately - costs would spike when the new health law insurance subsidies kicked in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It had to happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>How could we possibly put tens of millions more Americans on Medicaid and other taxpayer assistance and also save money at the same time?</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It was a laughable claim that Team Obama somehow reiterated time and again - and they even managed to keep a straight face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>And this is a president who lectures Republicans in Congress about "simple math."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Moore's argument is so incoherent that it is hard to follow, but let me try to explain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Higher health costs is not the same thing as higher federal spending on health care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Health-care costs is how much we pay for our treatments (which happens to be much more than what people in other countries pay).</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The idea of "bending the curve" is that, in addition to simply paying for the cost of covering the uninsured, Obamacare would try to tame the long-term trend toward health-care inflation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>That is not only happening, it is happening in a far more dramatic way than even the most optimistic advocates predicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>So Moore's belief that we see a "stampede of rising health costs" is the complete opposite of reality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>But now that Obamacare is the law of the land, the White House openly boasts about how many people are relying on taxpayers for health coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"Today's Medicaid enrollment report shows even more great news: Approximately 8.7 million additional Americans now have coverage through Medicaid and [the Children's Health Insurance Program], many for the very first time. Medicaid enrollment grew to more than 67.9 million in August 2014, which shows nearly a 15 percent increase over the average monthly enrollment for July through September 2013."</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Wait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>This is "great news?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>How is putting more people on Medicaid a triumph?</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Medicaid is a welfare program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>If this were a well-functioning economy with good jobs, Medicaid rolls would be shrinking and Americans would be coming self sufficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Mr. Clinton used to boast - justifiably so - after signing welfare reform about the millions of people that were taken off welfare during his watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>This president perversely boasts about how many people he puts on welfare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>So Moore's argument here is that covering the uninsured is bad because it's "welfare."</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Note that the colloquial definition of welfare is income support for working-age people who aren't working, as opposed to government subsidies in general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>That's why "welfare reform" described the reform of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, not Medicaid, or Social Security, or Medicare, or military pensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Medicaid, unlike traditional welfare, is not a program that gives people income support as a substitute for wage income.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>It is available to people who have jobs but not health insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>To be sure, one might morally object to the government subsidizing health insurance for people who can't afford it on their own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>But Bill Clinton is not and was not one of the people who has ever shared this belief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Clinton tried really hard to create government-subsidized access to health care for the uninsured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>He did not consider this "welfare."</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>A major reason more people are on Medicaid is that a near-record number of Americans of working age don't have a job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>They can't get health care through their non-existent employer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Yes, Medicaid enrollment rose in the wake of the economic crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>What does this have to do with Obamacare being a lie?</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Or anything?</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>At the same time, employers are also dropping their health coverage and dumping employees and their families on Medicaid and the Obamacare exchanges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>How is this a victory?</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>In fact, studies in the journal Health Affairs and surveys by Employee Benefit Research Institute and the Society for Human Resource Management found that Obamacare has not caused employers to drop coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Meanwhile, families are reporting hikes in premiums and fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>This is not enough of a factual statement to have clear meaning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>There are lots of families in this country, and some of them report different things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>Premiums for Obamacare plans are on average between 7 percent and 15 percent last year for the broad coverage plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>It is hard to substantiate or refute this, because it is not even an English sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>If Moore is contending that the cost of premiums in the exchanges is rising by 7 to 15 percent a year, he is way, way off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Health-care premiums have almost always increased annually throughout history, but the rate of increase next year is far lower than the historic average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Firms are just starting to respond to the spike in costs by dumping more workers into the government exchanges, which means even higher taxpayer costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Here he is repeating a false claim from two paragraphs before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>So, no, Obamacare has not saved families $2,500 a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Despite his "So," which is a word we generally use to indicate that we are continuing a line of thought previously introduced, Moore is bringing a completely different factual claim into this paragraph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>He also happens to be, once again, wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>No, it hasn't "bent the cost curve for health care down."</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>It has made the budget deficit much worse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Americans are losing the health coverage they have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>This begs the question: Is there a single promise that Mr. Obama made about Obamacare that has proven truthful?</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>There is not a single substantive claim in this column that appears to be true.</td></tr>

<h3>Poland to pay $262,000 to inmates held at secret CIA prison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign Minister Grzegorz Schetyna spoke after the European Court of Human Rights in France rejected Poland's appeal of its earlier ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We will abide by this ruling because we are a law-abiding country," Schetyna told Polish Radio 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It is a question of the coming weeks, a month."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But he questioned how the money would be used and whether it needed to be paid directly to the suspects, who are imprisoned in Guantanamo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Opposition lawmaker Witold Waszczykowski and some other lawmakers also said the money should not be paid to terror suspects because that would violate security interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The European court ruled in July that Poland violated the rights of terror suspects Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri by allowing the CIA to imprison them and by failing to stop the "torture and inhuman or degrading treatment" of the inmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It ordered Warsaw to pay 130,000 euros ($148,000) to Zubaydah, a Palestinian, and 100,000 euros ($114,000) to al-Nashiri, a Saudi national charged with orchestrating the attack in 2000 on the USS Cole that killed 17 U.S. sailors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Poland appealed the ruling, saying it could influence its own investigation of the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The July ruling was the first that any court has passed on the so-called "renditions program" that U.S. President George W. Bush launched after the terror attacks of Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>11, 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Since 2008, Polish prosecutors have been investigating whether Poland hosted a secret CIA prison, in violation of its laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They have charged one person, whose identity they did not reveal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Two past leaders, former President Aleksander Kwasniewski and former Prime Minister Leszek Miller, only recently admitted they had allowed the secret CIA prison to operate in Poland, but said they never authorized harsh treatment of inmates and had no oversight of the facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The European court's ruling is expected to speed up Poland's investigation, which is mostly classified.</td></tr>
