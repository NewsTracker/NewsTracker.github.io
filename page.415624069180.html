<h3>WSW bottom of table after 2-1 loss to Jets</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Wanderers are back on the bottom of the ladder after going down 2-1 to Newcastle in the A-League's basement battle on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The two-time grand-finalists and Asian Champions League title holders have struggled this A-League season as their hellish schedule continues to takes its toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With injuries wreaking havoc on the Wanderers' squad, Popovic was forced to dig deep into his reserves and field a line-up which featured seven players who've had less than 10 starts to their name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We didn't come into this game today thinking we couldn't win but the circumstances are what they are," Popovic said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We don't want to come last, certainly not. We're used to success here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Jets entered the Parramatta Stadium encounter sitting dead last as the only side with a solitary win, which came way back in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The three points now leaves them in ninth place, three points clear of Western Sydney, although the Wanderers have a game in hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We don't want the wooden spoon. That is obviously something that's in the back of the mind," Jets coach Phil Stubbins admitted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If you look at those amount of games where we've been accountable, to finally get a win down here is a great tonic for the group."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With all the inexperience in the Wanderers squad, ironically it was veteran Ante Covic who would falter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The goalkeeper came off his line to tackle a charging Enver Alivodic, but the Jets' Serbian recruit got past Covic to give the visitors the lead in the 22nd minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Jets doubled their advantage through Lee Kiji just before the break before Nick Kalmar got one back for the Wanderers from a free kick in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Overall we started bright but I think for them it would have been great if we took the lead, they would have relaxed a lot earlier," Popovic said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Then we made two very bad errors to give the goals away. It's the story of our season, we're always chasing the game and it was a lot of pressure for the young players."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Already without Brendon Santalab (shoulder), Shannon Cole (collarbone), Brendan Hamill (torn quadriceps), Mark Bridge (groin), Mateo Poljak (calf) and Ward (knee), Popovic has now lost Socceroos duo Matthew Spiranovic (hamstring) for up to three weeks and Tomi Juric (groin) for at least a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They were casualties of the Wanderers' Asian Champions League clash in Korea on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We lost two internationals in Korea. It's been difficult," Popovic admitted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We're down on numbers and we're down on experienced players."</td></tr>

<h3>Confidence in Ukraine's Cease-Fire Hurt by Arms Violations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The OSCE was tasked to verify the pullback of heavy weapons by the Ukrainian government forces and the rebels in eastern Ukraine under a cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With cameras and clipboards in hands, teams of blue-jacketed international observers drive around the muddy countryside of eastern Ukraine looking for rocket launchers and artillery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Their task is to verify whether government troops and Russian-backed rebel forces are removing heavy weapons from the front line in accordance with a February cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The success of the Organization for Security and Europe monitoring mission would lessen the chances that heavy fighting will resume in conflict that has already left more than 6,000 dead in a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Evidence is emerging, however, that the warring sides are leading monitors on a time-wasting game of hide-and-seek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Friday, an Associated Press journalist saw two tanks and two 120 mm guns being taken toward the front in rebel territory, near the separatist-held city of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two days earlier, Ukrainian troops were seen transporting a tank and a large-caliber gun in the town of Avdiivka, which also lies right on the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>None of the weapons should have been there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Under a peace deal laboriously negotiated between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, anything with a caliber of 100 mm or above should be pulled back 25 to 70 kilometers (15 to 45 miles) from the front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The weapons withdrawal began the last week of February and both sides claim to have completed the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the OSCE says to make sure the pullbacks happened, it must know how many weapons each side has and where they are being stored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Some information has been provided from both sides, but we still need substantial information," said Michael Bociurkiw, the OSCE mission spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Friday, a group of inspectors in rebel territory traveled from Donetsk to Novoamvrosiivske, a village near the Russian border where AP journalists on Feb. 26 followed four trucks carrying Grad launchers to a cement factory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In that same cement factory, monitors scrutinized dozens of tanks, rocket launchers and howitzers, eyeing serial plates, taking photos and writing down notes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Where serial numbers were scratched away, a photo was taken of that missing information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In separatist areas, OSCE teams have to ask in advance for permission to visit sites they wish to see and they travel under the supervision of rebel fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"They have complained to us that they can move around freely on Ukrainian territory," one rebel fighter, who gave his name as Major Yegorov, told the AP in Novoamvrosiivske.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"That is true, but on that territory there is no fighting. The war is here, in the southeast. So we control them because we want to provide safety for them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It is unclear to what extent the OSCE teams are able to decide on their own where to inspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On the road back to Donetsk after the Novoamvrosiivske inspection, fresh tracks on the asphalt in the Donetsk suburb of Makiivka appeared to indicate that a convoy of heavy machinery had passed through since the morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The OSCE team drove past, but an AP journalist followed the tracks to find two tanks in a multi-vehicle convoy that included truck-pulled cannons and troop carriers full of rebel fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>On Wednesday, two days earlier, a Ukrainian soldier told an AP reporter, laughing, that a cease-fire agreement-busting cannon that was being taken toward the front had a "90-something mm caliber."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The weapon was clearly more powerful than that.</td></tr>
