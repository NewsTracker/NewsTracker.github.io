<h3>Greece crisis: What are the consequences of a 'yes' or a 'no' vote at Tspiras's referendum?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece crisis: What are the consequences of a 'yes' or a 'no' vote at Tspiras's referendum?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Sunday July 5, the Greeks are voting in a referendum on whether they want to accept the European lenders' proposals for reform, which they must do if they are going to receive any more emergency aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was elected for his anti-austerity view - he stands against cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This is his big test of the Greek people to see if they still stand with him against the EC, the ECB and the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If they do agree with Tsipras that Greece should stand firm against austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tsipras has tweeted that it will mean they have a stronger bargaining position against the lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But naysayers have warned that it could mean the Greek banking system collapses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A woman holds a print of Sunday's referendum ballot paper in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This would mean Greece may have to leave the euro and re-establish its own currency in order to stabilize its economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That would have very serious consequence for the global economy - which is itself getting over a financial crisis - and the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It might even be more expensive for everyone to let Greece leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>European leaders have said that even if there is a no vote, Greece might not exit the Eurozone - basically they don't want Greece too, because then the project has failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A protestor holds a banner during the Melbourne stands with Greece solidarity rally outside Parliament House in Melbourne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If there is a yes vote, Yanis Varoufakis, has said that the Greek government will keep its word and accept the lenders' proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However he said it would not be easy for many ministers to accept this - even hinting that he might resign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>People prepare to cast ballots during a referendum in Athens, Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He also said he would rather cut his arm off than sign a deal without debt relief - a signal that Greece is looking for some of its debts to be written off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Talks will resume either way after the vote - at the moment the lenders are refusing to negotiate until they know the results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On Sunday July 5, the Greeks are going to vote in a referendum on whether they want to accept the European lenders' proposals for reform, which they must do if they are going to receive any more emergency aid.</td></tr>
