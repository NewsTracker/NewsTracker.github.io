<h3>The Latest: Hollande says Greek deal important for Europe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>French President Francois Hollande has hailed the agreement reached by eurozone leaders on Greece after marathon talks as a good deal for Greece and its European partners and creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hollande told reporters that, "Even if it was long, I think for Europe this was a good night, and a good day."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The French president, who had dispatched government functionaries to help Greece write reform proposals that would satisfy a more skeptical Germany, says one of the objectives of the emergency summit was to restore hope for the Greek people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He says Greece hadn't been looking for "welfare" from other European countries, but for a program that would help its economy grow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hollande says that to allow Greece to exit from the 19-nation eurozone would have been to lose a country that is "at the heart of our civilization."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He adds that failure to reach an agreement would have undermined the credibility of efforts to construct a more united Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says the country's new bailout program should persuade markets that a Greek exit from the euro "is an issue of the past."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That, he said, would lead to investments returning to Greece and balancing out the recessionary measures that the deal includes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tsipras says, "The decision today keeps Greece in conditions of financial stability, it gives the possibility of recovery. At the same time though, we knew from before, that it would be an agreement whose implementation is difficult."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But he promises the burdens of the new agreement would be fairly shared and vowed to fight the "oligarchy" in his country.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>He says: "We found ourselves before difficult decisions, tough dilemmas. We took the responsibility of the decision in order to avert the implementation of the more extreme aims (of) the more extreme conservative circles in the European Union."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He says Greece managed to resist a request that Greece transfer public assets abroad as well as a "plan of financial suffocation and the collapse of the banking system," which he said had been "planned down to its last detail recently" and had already started to be implemented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tsipras stresses Greece won concessions on restructuring Greece's debt and assured medium-term financing.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>Merkel says Greece's European creditors have agreed to a Greek bailout in which "Greece will ask, after the current IMF program expires in spring 2016, for further participation of the IMF."</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>Merkel said she recommended the start of negotiations with the cash-strapped country with "full conviction" but stressed that trust with Greece "needs to be rebuilt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>European Union President Donald Tusk says the agreement with creditors struck Monday morning will allow Greece to "get back on track."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Officials including European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker say the deal means that Greece will not have to leave the euro currency, the so-called Grexit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>French President Francois Hollande says the Greek parliament should convene within hours to adopt new reforms, and has praised the fact that the deal should keep Greece in the euro.</td></tr>

<tr><td>43</td><td>Pierre Moscovici played down ideological differences among Greece's European creditors on Monday, telling France's RTL radio that the marathon overnight negotiations show there is a "shared willingness to ensure that Greece remains in the euro."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Earlier in the negotiations there had been indications of splits among the European countries, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanding tough conditions before releasing aid while French President Francois Hollande prioritized unity among the nations that use the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Moscovici said Merkel and Hollande have "solid and direct" relations despite ideological differences and that "there is no solution for Europe" without agreement between the eurozone's two leading powers.</td></tr>

<tr><td>53</td><td>More than 15 hours after they started their discussions, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras appears to be holding out against two demands from his creditors: one related to the involvement of the International Monetary Fund in any bailout agreement, and the other a proposal that Greece set aside 50 billion euros ($56 billion) worth of state-owned assets in a fund for eventual privatization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Summit chair Donald Tusk has presented a "compromise proposal," details of which remained sketchy Monday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Any deal would see Greece accepting more austerity in exchange for a bailout to prevent its economy from collapsing.</td></tr>
