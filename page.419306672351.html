<h3>US eases crude oil export ban; allows trading with Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - The U.S. is easing its longstanding ban on crude oil exports by allowing limited trade with Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That's according to a senior Obama administration official who wasn't authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mexico's state-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, has sought to import about 100,000 barrels of light U.S. crude a day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last year it proposed a deal in which the U.S. would trade the light crude for heavier Mexican crude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The official says the Commerce Department is approving some license applications for the exchange of similar amount of U.S. and Mexican crude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Congress has pressed the Obama administration to lift the crude oil ban, with Republicans arguing it would make the U.S. an energy superpower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The ban has been in place for four decades.</td></tr>
