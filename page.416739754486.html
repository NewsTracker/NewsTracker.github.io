<h3>Google is starting small, thinking big with 'Project Fi'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) - Google wants the wireless services that connect mobile devices to digital content to be cheaper and more reliable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The reason has as much to do with the pursuit of profit as with trying to make smartphones more useful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>More time spent using Google's dominant search engine or watching videos on its popular YouTube site translates into more opportunities for the company to show its moneymaking ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Enter "Project Fi," the Internet company's recently launched attempt to usher in new ways to keep smartphones online while lowering the cost for streaming video, listening to music, getting directions and searching for information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Wireless connectivity has become so essential that it's kind of like our lifeblood," says Nick Fox, the Google Inc. executive overseeing Project Fi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This gives us a playground where we can try things out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a break from the status quo, Project Fi will cost just $20 for basic service and then only charge for the amount of data consumed over cellular networks that Google is leasing from T-Mobile and Sprint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Most plans charge a flat rate under metered plans that limit customers to a specific amount of data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google's service is also promising to automatically switch customers to publicly available Wi-Fi networks to avoid incurring charges for using data on the cellular networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Here are some key things to know about Project Fi culled from a recent interview with Fox at Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Although Fox wouldn't disclose how many customers Project Fi will accept, it's clearly going to be a relatively small pool of U.S. consumers at the outset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Getting on the wireless service requires a Nexus 6 smartphone, a model made by Motorola for Google as a showcase for how it would like its services to work with its Android operating system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Nexus 6 owners also need an invitation to subscribe to Project Fi (requests for invitation can be made here: https://fi.google.com/signup).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Google, though, is hoping Project Fi reshapes the market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If some of its technological features work well, Google will implant them into future updates of Android so they are available on the hundreds of millions of other devices running on the software, Fox said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>After spending more than two years developing Project Fi, Google is also counting on other wireless carriers copying its ideas, particularly on pricing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We are focused more on Android where we can have the most influence, but to the extent that the ideas take off and go broader than Project Fi, that's great for users," Fox said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Google ultimately just wants people to spend more of their lives online because when that happens, it brings more traffic to its search engine, YouTube and other services such as Gmail and maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Google's pricing system seems the feature most likely to shake up the wireless market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Project Fi only charges subscribers for the precise amount of cellular data used, an approach that Google came up with after its internal studies concluded most people consume less than 2 gigabytes a month yet often pay for much higher limits.</td></tr>
