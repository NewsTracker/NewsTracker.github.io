<h3>'Duang!' Chinese poke fun at Jackie Chan with nonsense word</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A new mash-up video of the old ad has made "duang" a trending topic on China's social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The sound began circulating days before the rubberstamp legislature was called into session this week, and some observers see it as a way for the public to question the credibility of delegates and express dissatisfaction with the political system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chan, now a quasi-politician appointed to a legislative advisory panel, has been singled out not only because of his celebrity status but for his reputation among many Chinese as someone who has been mercenary in aligning himself politically with China's Communist Party to tap the mainland's movie market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Though the tone of the phrase is more derisive than fun, Chan has been a good sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's quite funny," he told reporters on the steps of Beijing's Great Hall of the People this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chan used the sound in a 2004 infomercial to sell shampoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the ad, he maintains there was no "duang" " or special effects " to make his hair look blacker, shinier and softer, but that the shampoo itself was responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Authorities later ruled that the commercial made false claims, and Chan's reputation suffered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The word "duang" " in its Romanized form " has become one of the hottest expressions in Chinese cyberspace, and parodies of Chan's shampoo endorsement are spreading online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Someone has even proposed a Chinese character for the sound by overlaying the two characters of Jackie Chan's name, though modern Chinese does not officially incorporate new characters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chan is one of just a few well-known faces connected to the legislature, a body the public has little influence over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"When the legitimacy of these delegates gets questioned, celebrities such as Jackie Chan are the first to be targeted, because the public does not know other delegates," said Beijing-based independent commentator Shi Shusi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Those jokes relay a sense of anxiety."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chan has been a polarizing figure on his own as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In 2009, he spoke against freedoms in Hong Kong and Taiwan, saying, "The Chinese need to be supervised, or they will do whatever they please."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last year, he spoke against Hong Kong's democracy protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In 2013, Beijing appointed Chan to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, or CPPCC, the highest advisory body to the national legislature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"What Jackie Chan has said shows he does not have the sense of right or wrong, but the sense of interest," said Beijing economics professor Hu Xingdou, who called for a boycott of Chan in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jokes suggesting slyness and snobbery on Chan's part have surfaced one after another in China's cyberspace over the past several years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When his son, Jaycee Chan, was arrested on drug charges last year, the public gloated, pointing out the irony that the father has served as China's anti-drug ambassador.</td></tr>

<h3>News24.com | Hillary Clinton urges State Department to release emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I want the public to see my email," the potential 2016 presidential candidate said in a tweet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Clinton's statement was aimed at cooling a political firestorm over allegations that she inappropriately used her personal email for work while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The controversy has suddenly put Clinton into trouble just as she is planning to launch a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It has prompted some Democrats to wonder whether someone else from their party should be their candidate to succeed President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton's tweeted statement came hours after a congressional committee investigating the 11 September 2012, attack on a US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, issued subpoenas for her emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The US House of Representatives' Select Committee on Benghazi demanded all communications from Clinton related to the incident, in which a US ambassador was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The panel also sent letters to internet companies telling them to protect any documents relevant to the ongoing investigation, Jamal Ware, communications director for the Benghazi committee, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Representative Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairperson of the Benghazi panel, told reporters that within two weeks, he must either have the documents or a "really good explanation" for why they may be delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Republicans have been scrutinising Clinton's actions and communications surrounding the Benghazi attack, when Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others were killed during an assault on the US consulate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Republican lawmakers believe she did not do enough to ensure the safety of Americans in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi committee, said the Republicans' actions have led him to believe they simply want to attack Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He noted that Colin Powell, the secretary of state under former President George W. Bush, a Republican, had used personal emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The email controversy appeared to have caught the Clinton camp off guard when it erupted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In an appearance in Washington on Tuesday night, Clinton avoided the topic altogether in a 30-minute speech at a gala dinner for the Emily's List political organisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The state department has defended Clinton, saying that at the time there was no prohibition on using a personal email account for official business as long as it was preserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But experts have called her use of personal email highly unusual in an era when most US government electronic emails are archived, and that her practise possibly left her communications open to hacking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The state department said Clinton last year turned over emails from the period after a records request and that 300 of these were sent to the Benghazi committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A total of 55 000 pages of material covering the time she was in office were turned over, the agency said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Jason R Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, said on Tuesday he believed "the sole use of a private email account by a high-level official to transact government business is plainly inconsistent with the Federal Records Act and longstanding policies of the National Archives".</td></tr>
