<h3>Nemtsov's daughter: TV propaganda factor behind his killing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOSCOW (AP) - The daughter of Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov has blamed state propaganda for fomenting hatred and intolerance that contributed to his killing in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Zhanna Nemtsova said in a column published Tuesday in the business daily Vedomosti that responsibility for her father's death was shared by employees of state-controlled TV who cast him and other opposition leaders as "national traitors."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She urged the West to introduce sanctions against those involved in "criminal propaganda."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nemtsova, who worked for the independent RBC news channel, was quoted by RBC as saying Monday she had recently left Russia amid threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Her father was shot dead just outside the Kremlin on Feb. 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The investigators have arrested five suspects, all Chechen, but haven't yet determined who ordered the slaying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The suspected triggerman was an officer in Chechnya's police force, and the Kremlin-backed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov praised him as a good patriot of Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Federal investigators have failed to get to another suspect, a senior officer in Kadyrov's security force, who was under protection in Chechnya and then reportedly was whisked abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nemtsova's lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, said the stalled probe highlighted dangers for leaders of Russia's embattled opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The leaders of Chechnya have received medals instead of summons," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Prokhorov also pointed at a sudden, mysterious illness of Nemtsov's close associate, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who has remained in a serious condition a week after his hospitalization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Doctors said he was suffering from kidney failure, but no cause has been determined.</td></tr>
