<h3>Ferguson inspires Roosters to Penrith win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"There was enough pressure applied through our 'D' for the most part," Robinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Panthers coach Ivan Cleary did his best to hide his frustration over the no-try decision as his side slipped to their first defeat of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I thought it was a try," Cleary said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"If you have to have a video then I like the system. I've never been a fan of the video because they don't necessarily get it right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"But I like the fact referees make a call."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Robinson said he was unsure if the call went in his side's favour but echoed Cleary's support for referees to make an on-field judgment before sending the decision upstairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I thought it was close, but as soon as they awarded no try it wasn't definitive," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It looked like it bounced live ... we kept looking for one or another and that is as fair as a description as I can give it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Two Blake Ferguson tries helped the Sydney Roosters to a 20-12 victory over Penrith on Monday but once again a refereeing howler was at the centre of attention at Allianz Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ferguson crossed twice in the second half - his first scores for the club - as the Roosters bounced back from last week's defeat to South Sydney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The centre's last four-pointers in the NRL came on this ground in August 2013 in his final game for Canberra against the side that he now plays for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Trailing 6-0 to a first-half Shaun Kenny-Dowall try, Panthers winger Dallin Watene-Zelezniak looked to have scored with brilliant one-handed effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lead referee Gerrard Sutton called no-try but requested a video referral and footage clearly showed the young Kiwi had downward pressure on the ball with his fingertips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>However, Shayne Hayne and Luke Patten backed Sutton's initial call much to the relief of the majority of the 10,753 crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Penrith, chasing a first 3-0 start to a season since 1997, soon found themselves 8-0 down when James Maloney converted a penalty before a moment of magic from Josh Mansour got them on the scoreboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Returning to the side following off-season shoulder surgery, Mansour hauled in a Peter Wallace kick, then kept his feet in play and shovel-passed to the onrushing Jamal Idris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Matt Moylan's sideline kick cut the deficit to two points at halftime only for Ferguson to extend the hosts' lead five minutes after the restart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A wayward pass from Mitchell Pearce hit the ground but Ferguson reacted quickest to gather the ball and sprint to the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He doubled his tally just after the hour mark when the Roosters took advantage of a James Segeyaro's knock-on and spread the ball wide for the former NSW centre to apply an easy finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Segeyaro atoned for that error with a try under the posts 13 minutes from time but a grandstand finish never materialised as the Roosters defence held firm.</td></tr>
