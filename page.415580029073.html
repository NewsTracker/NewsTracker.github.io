<h3>US, Israel have no choice but to work together: Netanyahu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Speaking to NBC television in his first US media interview since his election victory, Netanyahu said the countries may have disagreements but in the end, "we'll work together, we have to ... because we have no other alternative."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We can have differences, but we have so many things that unite us and we have a situation in the Middle East that is very dangerous and presents a common challenge for us," the Israeli leader said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ties between Israel and the United States have plunged to an all-time low, after Netanyahu angered the Obama administration by giving a passionate speech to Congress blasting an Iran nuclear deal under negotiation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The White House has been further exasperated by Netanyahu's last-minute campaign promises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In an apparent U-turn -- and a challenge to decades of US policy -- he said he would never agree to a Palestinian state as prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We have to consult each other, not have fiats or unilateral imposition, but negotiated peace with our neighbors and support between allies," Netanyahu insisted to NBC News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"America has no greater ally than Israel and Israel has no greater ally than the United States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The news that Netanyahu on Tuesday had won an unprecedented fourth term as Israeli prime minister has been met with a cool reception in the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry was given the task of making the congratulatory phone call -- from Switzerland, where he is currently in negotiations with the Iranians over the controversial nuclear deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Obama is expected to ring Netanyahu in "the coming days," the White House said, in a sign of the frosty ties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Secretary Kerry called me yesterday and I'm sure I'll be speaking to President Obama soon," Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
