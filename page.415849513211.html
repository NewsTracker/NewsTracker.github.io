<h3>PlayStation Gets Spotify, Replacing Sony's Own Music Service</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Spotify is coming to the PlayStation, replacing Sony's own Music Unlimited service, as the company continues to expand the game console into an entertainment hub beyond video games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Spotify hits the PlayStation 3 and 4 on Monday, with a new app adapted for large television screens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sony says partnering with Spotify expands its music service to 41 countries, rather than the 19 available with Music Unlimited, and offers better tools for playlists and music discovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>PlayStation users have long been able to watch DVDs and stream Netflix, Amazon and YouTube shows with the console.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Just two weeks ago, Sony launched an online television service, PlayStation Vue, offering more than 50 over-the-air and cable channels starting at $50 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Spotify has 60 million active users worldwide, including 15 million paid subscribers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Its music app is available on some Internet-connected TVs and set-top boxes, but Spotify says it worked closely with Sony to optimize its service for the PlayStation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Notable features include: the ability to listen to music while playing a game and still listening to sound effects, or automatically pausing the game while changing volume or playlists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The service is free with ads, or costs $10 a month for a premium ad-free version that offers offline playback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Although free users aren't allowed to choose specific songs on mobile devices, they will be able to on the PlayStation, just as they now do on traditional computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Customers who do not already have a Spotify account can sign up on the PlayStation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Existing Spotify customers will get access to the PlayStation app with their usual sign-in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Music Unlimited subscribers won't be automatically switched over; those that subscribe on other devices such as Sony phones, will need to get the Spotify app.</td></tr>
