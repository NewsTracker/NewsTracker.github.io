<h3>Pentagon silent on Iraq's prediction of Tikrit air strikes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon declined comment on Iraqi President Fouad Massoum's prediction on Wednesday that the U.S.-led coalition would soon carry out air strikes against Islamic State in Tikrit, saying the United States would not discuss future military operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren, however, confirmed Massoum's official disclosure in a Reuters interview that United States had started flying intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) flights over Tikrit in support of Iraq forces on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We do not normally telegraph future operations, so I will not comment on that. He also mentioned that we were providing ISR over Tikrit. I am prepared to confirm that," Warren told a news briefing at the Pentagon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Massoum stressed that Iraq was seeking a balance among Iranian, Western and Arab states participating in the fight against Islamic State, which aims to create a modern-day Islamic caliphate imposing a militant form of Islamic law across the Middle East.</td></tr>
