<h3>Malaysia proposes anti-terror laws to curb Islamic militants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The government has detained scores of Malaysians suspected of supporting the Islamic State militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Critics however, slammed the laws as a revival of a controversial security law that was repealed in 2012 and warned it could severely curtail civil liberties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Prevention of Anti-Terror bill introduced Monday needs to be approved by Parliament for it to become law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It would allow authorities to detain suspects indefinitely without trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Another new law gives power to authorities to seize the travel documents of any citizen or foreigners suspected to be engaged in or support of terrorist acts.</td></tr>
