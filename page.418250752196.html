<tr><td>4</td><td>"They actually dragged out 11 persons to the Eid praying ground outside the town and slaughtered all of them," said Kimba.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It is the fifth attack in a week that left 173 people killed as Boko Haram Islamic extremists appear to obey an Islamic State group order to step up attacks in the holy month of Ramadan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Boko Haram became the ISIS group's West Africa franchise earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yesterday, a woman and a girl strapped with explosives blew up and killed 13 people at a crowded market and a military checkpoint in Malari village, just outside Maiduguri city, according to security guard Abba Shehu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the most deadly attack, the militants targeted several mosques in Kukawa town on Thursday, gunning down nearly 100 praying worshippers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kukawa is 180 kilometres northeast of Maiduguri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The militants, who want to impose their strict version of Shariah law across Nigeria, often defile mosques where clerics preach against their extremism.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Another 1.5 million people have been driven from their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Boko Haram took over a large swath of northeastern Nigeria last year and stepped up cross-border raids.</td></tr>
