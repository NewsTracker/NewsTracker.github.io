<h3>Islamic State suspected of using poison gas in Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A member of Islamic State waves an IS flag in Raqqa, Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Istanbul: Islamic State may have used chemical agents in an attack against civilians and rival insurgents in northern Syria late last week, according to local rebels and an international aid group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The assault in the city of Marea on Friday involved more than 50 shells and was centred on civilian areas, the Syrian American Medical Society, a humanitarian group, reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After the attack, the group's field hospital received more than 50 patients, 23 of whom, including some children, showed symptoms of chemical exposure, including coughing, vomiting, wheezing and severe itching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some also had blisters associated with mustard gas, the society said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pigeons lie on the ground after dying from what activists said was the use of chemical weapons by forces loyal to President Bashar Al-Assad in Damascus in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The report was corroborated by local rebel forces, who claimed that shells had been fired from Isnibil, a village east of Marea that is controlled by IS, also known as ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"At least half of the 50 mortar and artillery shells fired by ISIS contained poisonous mustard gas," said Hussein Nasir, a spokesman for a Syrian rebel group, the Shami Front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His group had consulted a general who defected from the Syrian army and was familiar with chemical weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After hearing accounts of the attack and seeing videos and photographs of the shells, the general concluded that some of the shells contained mustard gas, Mr Nasir said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A woman affected by what activists said was a gas attack last year is transferred to Bab al-Hawa hospital, close to the Turkish border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This month, the Pentagon said IS was suspected of using chemical agents in an attack against Kurdish forces in northern Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>US officials said they were also looking into reports of a mustard gas attack on Kurdish fighters in , Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The shells landed randomly on different parts of the city resulting in many injuries," Mr Nasir said of the attack on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Some bad odour filled the air, and those who were exposed showed symptoms of suffocation, skin irritation and swelling."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When the shells hit, opponents of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad were commemorating the second anniversary of a chemical weapons attack on a Damascus suburb carried out by the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A nurse at the field hospital run by the Syrian American Medical Society said he had noticed a strange odour on the clothes of the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We received a family in very bad condition - two parents and a child," the nurse, Tariq Najjar, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"They had difficulty breathing, severe headaches, a running nose, skin irritation and red teary eyes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Five more shells were fired on Saturday, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>One person was killed in the attack, but apparently by conventional ordnance, not chemical agents, the rebels said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The medical society said in a statement that there had been no deaths from chemical agents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Marea links the much larger city of Aleppo to the Turkish border, and it is a crucial strategic prize for IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Many of its residents have fled the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The city has long been held by insurgents, who initially took up arms against the Assad government but have also clashed with IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Marea was one of the first strongholds of the rebel forces that were then made up of army defectors and townspeople.</td></tr>
