<h3>'Majority of Our Work Is Complete' on Tamir Rice, Sheriff Says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cuyahoga County Sheriff Clifford Pinkney updates the public on the investigation into the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, May 12, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The sheriff leading the investigation into last year's shooting death of Tamir Rice said today "the majority of our work is complete" but he did not reveal any findings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cuyahoga County Sheriff Clifford Pinkney gave a statement this morning laying out a timeline of the nearly six months since the 12 year old was fatally shot by police officers while he was holding an airsoft gun in a Cleveland playground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He detailed the timeline of police actions since the Nov. 22 shooting, saying how the prosecuting attorney's office and the City of Cleveland have passed both unredacted and redacted versions of the investigation file back and forth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said the investigation began "in earnest" in mid-February after his office received the redacted file from the county prosecutor's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"As you can see, we have been tirelessly working on this investigation," Pinkney said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pinkney said he would not give a set deadline for the investigation, though he did say his department has conducted thousands of hours of interviews and has done 3-D processing of the crime scene that they believe have helped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"For the sake of the integrity of this investigation, I'm not willing to do that," he said of giving a deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Today's news conference comes a week after lawyers for Tamir Rice's relatives pushed for the police to stop delaying a civil suit against the officers who shot Rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The police officers asked a judge to delay the federal civil rights lawsuit until the investigation is complete because they reportedly fear that their testimony in the suit could be used against them later in any possible criminal case, according to The Associated Press.</td></tr>
