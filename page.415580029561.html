<h3>Midterms: Should Americans be forced to vote? (Opinion)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Let's imagine a future in which Americans must vote, or face a penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's April 2021.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Media outlets around the country headlined major agreements between Democrats and Republicans on the long-stalled issues of tax and immigration reform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Commentators marveled at the momentous shift in American politics away from the polarization and gridlock of the previous two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>What happened?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although opinions differed, observers agreed on one key point: The decision to follow the lead of countries such as Australia and institute mandatory voting in national elections transformed the political landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As turnout rose from 60% to 90%, citizens with less intense partisan and ideological commitments flooded into the electorate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Campaigns could no longer prevail simply by mobilizing core supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Instead, they had to persuade swing voters to come their way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They soon discovered that these new voters preferred compromise to confrontation and civil discourse to scorched-earth rhetoric.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Candidates who presented themselves as willing to reach across the aisle to get things done got a boost while zealots went down to defeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both political parties soon realized that they had a stake in a nominating process that produced the kinds of candidates the expanded electorate preferred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They eliminated party caucuses dominated by intense minorities and opened up their primaries to independents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They discovered that maximizing participation in their primaries was the best way of preparing for the general election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Individual donors, who wanted to invest in winners, favored candidates who could command broad support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Once in office, members of the House and Senate tried hard to keep faith with the expanded electorate that had sent them to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They spent less time in party caucuses and more doing serious legislative work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Congressional leaders returned power to the committees, where members relearned the art of compromise across party lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>William Galston is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and holds the Ezra K. Zilkha Chair in its governance studies program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>With roughly 40% of eligible citizens voting, turnout in U.S. midterm elections is notoriously low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Compulsory voting offers one possible, if radical, solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Like any political institution, laws on it have multiple, if disputed, consequences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Today, compulsory voting exists in roughly a quarter of all democracies in the world, ranging from Western Europe and Australia to Latin America and Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Yet few believe that it stands any chance of being adopted in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Our research suggests that the decision to adopt compulsory voting is largely strategic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>While proponents often couch their arguments in terms of public benefits, it appears that parties around the world have been more likely to adopt it when such laws stand to favor their candidates and hurt their opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Changing the electoral rules is not a risk-free proposition, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Governing parties are unlikely to modify the rules that elected them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Only governing parties with relatively under-mobilized electorates and a growing opposition find compulsory voting an attractive option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Interestingly, conservatives in the late 19th and early 20th century in Western Europe and Latin America were the first to champion compulsory voting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Expansion of suffrage dramatically shifted the composition of the voting population, while industrialization swelled the ranks of the working class and created new political identities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>During this period, the left's organizational ability to mobilize voters was unmatched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Parties on the right countered with mandatory voting, which aimed to bring out their natural constituencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Today, the situation in the United States is just the opposite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>With unions in decline, Democrats are disproportionately hurt by abstention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>A recent George Washington University poll shows that in the coming election Republicans are fully 7 percentage points more likely to vote than Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In other words, the politicians that will likely determine the rules of the game have no incentive to change them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Gretchen Helmke is associate professor and chairwoman of the political science department at the University of Rochester.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Bonnie Meguid is associate professor in the same department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Technically speaking, Australian citizens are not compelled to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Instead, they are required to attend a polling station, and upon receipt of their ballot, decide to vote or discard it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Granted, the failure to attend to one's "democratic duty" may incur a small fine if insufficient excuse is offered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>This approach goes back decades, having been adopted in 1924 for national elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>But the idea itself is even older, having been debated in 19th century colonial parliaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>While views vary as to the ultimate cause of its introduction, there is no doubt that concerns over low voter turnout, in a nation only two decades old, drove the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Shepherding people to vote in this way might seem odd to some, but government loomed large in colonial Australia -- in sharp contrast to the American experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>This tradition of state paternalism did not wane when the Federation of Australia was formed in 1901 (i.e., when the six separate colonies became one nation).</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>So, it was not surprising that the decision to compel voters to attend to duty was ultimately a bipartisan decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>How successful has this approach been?</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>In recent decades, about 5% of voters are typically asked to explain their absence on polling day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Surveys consistently indicate that about 70% say they favor compulsory voting, and 80% say they would still vote even if voting was not compulsory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>A decade ago, the conservative coalition government of John Howard controlled both houses of parliament, and its Senate leader proposed abolishing compulsory voting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>In the end, old habits die hard, and the proposal failed to gain traction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Political parties here may have good reasons to keep the current system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>After all, "mandatory" voting makes it easier for politicians to keep the focus on attacking opponents, without being distracted by the task of encouraging a sometimes disillusioned party base to turn out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>I've been a supporter of "compulsion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>But in the contemporary campaign setting, I doubt its virtues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Turning the vote out might not be a problem, but wooing disengaged citizens now requires banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>To me, this can diminish the democratic experience for those who take the time to think through the issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Haydon Manning is an associate professor at Flinders University's School of Social and Policy Studies in Adelaide, South Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Should voting be compulsory?</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>No. Should voting be far easier?</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>The arguments for compulsory voting seem persuasive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>At least 38 countries have- or have had- some form of mandatory voting laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>U.S. turnout, in contrast, falls short of most advanced democracies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Low turnout imposes real costs on our political system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>It both reflects and helps drive an eroding sense of democratic legitimacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>It negatively impacts the representation of groups with low turnout levels, like younger voters and minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>And it magnifies the power of special interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Yet, mandatory voting is ill-suited to America's current realities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>First, it's impractical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Congress is currently incapable of passing a mandatory voting law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>The federal bureaucracy and court system, moreover, are unlikely to be able to enforce any such law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Would we impose sanctions on those who fail to vote?</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Would there be an exemption system?</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Is the voting system even equipped to handle a rush of new voters?</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>(Remember the long lines of 2012 and the butterfly ballots of 2000?)</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Mandatory voting would be a bureaucratic and legal nightmare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Not to mention that refusing to vote itself can be an important form of protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>Far more important than the red herring on mandatory voting would be to make it far easier to register and cast a ballot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Options available to facilitate voting include: making election day a national holiday or a weekend; expanding early voting and same-day voter registration, both of which Republicans have cut back in many states; creating an opt-out rather than an opt-in voter registration system; and increasing opportunities for remote voting via absentee ballots, vote-by-mail, or online voting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Voting rights remains an important issue, especially given the rising cacophony about largely nonexistent "voter fraud."</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>(One recent investigation found 31 credible incidents of voter impersonation in 1 billion ballots).</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>But the way to increase voter participation isn't to mandate it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>It's to build a system capable of accommodating our citizens' voting needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Ari Ratner is a fellow at New America Foundation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Donna Brazile: You have to pay taxes, so why not have to vote?</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Mandatory voting requires citizens to present themselves at the polling place and either cast their votes on the candidates and issues, or spoil a ballot, indicating their disgust with the entire lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>I've come to favor mandatory voting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>It will sink the role of big money in our elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>Campaign spending is becoming a scourge and a scandal in our self-government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Millions are even spent for the anti-democratic purpose of reducing voter turnout for the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>All that money, from secret contributors - guaranteeing greater influence for those who have money, over those who do not - cannot possibly have a healthy effect on the candidates on whom it pours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Are things better since the Supreme Court allowed big money to be introduced?</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>In the United States, voter turnout for midterm elections has been under 50% since the 1940s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>This means that less than half of the American electorate gets to decide which party will control Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>This can't be a good thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>In places that have mandatory voting, like Australia, there are indications of less polarization and dissatisfaction in the electorate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>I know some bristle at the idea of having to cast a vote, even a protest vote for Lassie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>Yet, voting is the essential, central and indispensable feature of democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>We require jury attendance, paying taxes, and public education attendance because those are also essential functions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Is voting less important?</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>A nationally syndicated columnist, she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of "Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America."</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine stuck on an IMF dripfeed a year after Crimea seizure</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A year on from Russia's seizure of Crimea, it looks unlikely it will live up to the terms of its latest deal with the IMF also.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ukraine's finance minister believes the IMF's money is "not forever", but over-optimistic economic assumptions and continued fighting in the east of the country will probably mean Ukraine will end up depending on foreign support given on its geopolitical significance, experts and former IMF officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The IMF, whose shareholding structure is dominated by the United States and Europe, recently approved a $17.5 billion lending program for Ukraine, of which $10 billion will be disbursed this year, an unusually large amount of front-loaded cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ukraine is also set to receive $7.5 billion from other donors over the next 18 months, part of an overall $40 billion package over the next four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I do fear that Ukraine could need extended international support, including from the IMF," said Robert Kahn, a former World Bank and Fund official now at the Council on Foreign Relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I would argue the Fund is being brought into cases where there are political elements," he said, in reference to Ukraine and Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It takes the Fund well outside its remit and its expertise."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Greece, the IMF admitted it lowered its own standards to bail out the country on fears its crisis could spread to the entire euro zone, raising concerns about the IMF's impartiality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Another example is Pakistan, a key U.S. ally, which is on its 21st program worth at least $26 billion in total.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It has had seven successful exits so far, and only one since 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The IMF's watchdog, the Independent Evaluation Office, found in a 2002 report that middle-income countries like Pakistan were likely to get stuck in long-running programs when the international community put pressure on the IMF to provide a "seal of approval."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The IMF broadly agreed with the findings, and promised to regularly assess so-called "prolonged use" countries, and improve its program design.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But in a follow-up in 2013, the Independent Evaluation Office found some of the same issues persisted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The IMF did not have an immediate comment on Thursday but it has emphasized Ukraine's new government is much more committed to reforms than Kiev has been in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But even the Fund admits the underlying assumptions in its Ukraine program carry "exceptionally high" risks from further conflict in the east with Russian-backed separatists and disgruntled creditors, as Ukraine seeks to gain about $15 billion in debt relief from bondholders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some $3 billion of that debt is owed to Moscow, which has so far replied with an emphatic "niet" as to whether it is willing to renegotiate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The IMF's founders in 1944 envisaged the institution as a financial firefighter which is called in for emergencies and then departs once a crisis is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But over time, the IMF has found itself entangled for much longer, sometimes for decades, with repeated programs that seek to implement so-called "structural reforms" that tackle corruption, inefficient taxes, and bloated public institutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the current crop of 36 countries with programs, all but Cyprus have borrowed from the IMF at least once since 1992.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And 53 percent of borrowers have drawn on IMF funds for at least 10 of the last 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After a year of political upheaval and war, Ukraine's currency has plunged to record lows, interest rates are at 15-year highs and reserves have dwindled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Ukraine's finance minister, Natalia Yaresko, admits the IMF cash may not be enough to restore the country to economic growth and has asked the United States for more financial support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Yarekso insists she will come back to financial markets in a few years, weaning her country off emergency lending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The IMF is a very important part of our program, but it's not forever," she told Reuters on a visit to Washington this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In order to lend Ukraine so much money, the IMF has to satisfy its own rules that Kiev's debt is sustainable with a "high probability."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>That does not look likely, according to outside economists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In last year's program for Ukraine, the IMF thought the economy would grow 1.0 percent in 2014, but has since revised its predictions to a contraction of 6.9 percent last year, and 5.5 percent this year, and even that is seen as optimistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"All that's left for Ukraine is the IMF," said Domenico Lombardi, a former IMF board director now with the Canada-based Center for International Governance Innovation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"(But) the odds that the program isn't going to be fully implemented are huge."</td></tr>
