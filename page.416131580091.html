<h3>Latest on Apple Watch release: Shoppers get personal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>From Beijing to Paris to San Francisco, the Apple Watch made its debut Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Customers were invited to try them on in stores and order them online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>9:51 a.m. EDT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Victor Leung is grinning from ear to ear after finishing his watch appointment at the 5th Avenue store and ordering the sport model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The student says he's been waiting for this launch since September and is the first among his friends to get the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's awesome," Leung says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"You get texts on your watch, make phone calls."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While he has tried other smartwatches, he thinks "Apple is different," more unique.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Andrew Klink snapped a photo of the sports watch display case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"My boyfriend wants it," says the retired American who is visiting New York from his home in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He's "not sure this is something anybody needs," but likes the simple design, the matte color of the sports watch strap, and the clasp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>9:03 a.m. EDT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As Apple's 5th Avenue store in New York City prepares to open, journalists and Apple employees outnumber people waiting for the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Robert Jose, who has lined up in the drizzle not for a watch but to get a charger and exchange his iPhone, thought it would be a "little crazier" given the usual hoopla around iPhone launches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It doesn't look like Black Friday yet. No fists flying," the retail worker says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Caught up in the excitement anyway, Jose wants to "get in there" to get a glimpse at the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Physician Asif Luqman has made an appointment to look at a steel version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I'm not getting it, just want to try it on. I like watches a lot," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He wants to see it because it is the first of its kind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Apple, he believes, has put in the time and the effort to make a high-quality watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He's not getting it though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I'm waiting for the next version," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I want a watch that can function on its own."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Now it's a small screen on your wrist for your phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I don't need that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As a doctor, he's also concerned about battery life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>His phone already dies halfway through the day, the watch dies faster and not enough people will have it yet to have chargers laying around, he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In London's Covent Garden, a tourist hotspot, a buzz is growing in the Apple flagship store as dozens of fans come to check out the new Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Some crouch over glass counters to play with sample watches, while others who had pre-booked appointments try them on their wrists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I've been waiting for this for a long time," says Carl Walsh, a 43-year-old company director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"It's beautifully developed, but I'll probably want to wait a bit and see what people say about the battery life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The watch is Apple's first new product category since the iPad came out five years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Analysts are waiting to see how well the watch will sell beyond devoted Apple fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Apple has a better chance at succeeding than any other smartwatch maker so far, yet it will likely take time before sales reach the kind of numbers that Apple gets for iPhones and iPads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Watch prices start at $349, but can go as high as $17,000 for a luxury edition in gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>People can try the watch on in Apple stores, but for now all orders are being handled online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Shipments begin April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Regy Selsaas, 42, is here to see if the watch would make a good gift for his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"It's more like a gadget than a phone," he says, wincing at the high price tag of the luxury version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"It's really beautiful but expensive. I'm not 100 percent convinced."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Jay Carroll, 15, needs no persuading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>He and his mother Sarah placed an online order first thing Friday, but the two still wanted to try it out in store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"I'm looking forward to just having it there on my wrist, so I can be on my phone all the time," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The curious in Japan form a long line in Isetan department store, where a special section was built just for the Apple watch.</td></tr>
