<h3>Apple Music Review: Messy Yet Magical</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple's new on-demand streaming music service has a fantastic collection of playlists, but for $10 a month, it's still far from perfect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WSJ's Joanna Stern reviews Apple Music in song.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Let me get this out of the way: I don't love Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But I didn't love the original iPod, either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I didn't consider buying Steve Jobs' little white phenomenon when it was first released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>No need, I already had a perfectly functional Rio MP3 player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Of course, we all know how that song ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rio didn't live to see 'N Sync break up, while the iPod upended the music industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple's brand new streaming music service is a lot like the first iPod.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If you've already used Spotify, Rdio or the handful of other streaming music services, there's nothing remarkably new or different about Apple's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In some respects, it isn't as good as them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But it still stands to change how the world listens to music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Apple Music is jam packed with music recommendations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The perfect mixtape for Joanna Stern's experience getting to know Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>See, with a small software update, Apple is putting on-demand streaming of 30 million songs on most iPhones, iPads, Macs and iTunes-equipped Windows PCs-completely free for three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>After the trial period, it costs $10 a month, $15 for up to six people in your family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>All you need is an Internet connection and, well, to decide if streaming is worth it for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>So, if you can try it free, why do you need to read this review?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Because, having used all of the leading competitors, I can say that while Apple Music may be taking the secret of on-demand streaming to the masses, the app itself isn't ready for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Here's how Apple Music isn't at all like that first iPod: It is so jam packed with features, it lacks polish and simplicity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But its ability to know what I want to listen to next is so darn good, we may all be willing to live with the shortcomings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Think of Apple Music's interface as a game of Memory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The iPhone and iPad app, organized into five tabs, is so crammed with items, lists and menus that it's hard to find things initially, harder still to remember where they are later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Seriously, it's like Russian nesting dolls: menus within menus within menus!</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Worse, things you'd assume would be simple aren't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It's what I call the "Am I an idiot?" interface problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>For instance, I couldn't figure out how to jump to Elton John's artist page when "Your Song" popped up in a great suggested playlist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Apple Music is divided into five different sections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Turns out I wasn't the idiot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Instead of just tapping the artist's name (which brings up a star rating option), you have to tap the three-dot menu button (as opposed to the three-line menu button) and then the song name (but not "Show in iTunes," which takes you to a completely different app!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Even when I had mastered that, I often landed on a broken "Unknown Artist" screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That's why they call it the blues, indeed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Siri to the rescue!</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>At times the best workaround for interface confusion was beckoning Siri with commands like "Search for Elton John in Apple Music."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Not only can she search for specific songs or artists, she knows the top charts better than Casey Kasem ever did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Play the best songs of 1979," and next thing you know you're dancing to "My Sharona."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>(But beware: As with HomeKit, Siri must be commanded with specific strings of words.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>You begin by telling the app what sort of music you like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Too bad Siri can't help you navigate iTunes on a Mac or PC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Apple's bloated 14-year old media manager needed more features like CVS needs another toothpaste shelf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The already sluggish and hard-to-navigate software is made worse by the addition of Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>I got used to the interface in a couple of days but, like on iOS, I encountered bugs in both the Mac and Windows versions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>All your iTunes-purchased tracks and any locally stored music are found under the My Music tab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>(You can also sync all your old songs, either with the $25-per-year iTunes Match, or Apple's new iCloud Music Library, part of Apple Music which is required for other features.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>You can add anything you hear to My Music, even playlists, and download selections for offline listening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>As long as you keep paying for Apple Music, you'll "have" those new tracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Spotify and Rdio's more mature Web and mobile apps are easier to use for the time being, but oddly it is Apple Music's clunky iTunes integration that makes it so good at guessing what you want to hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>It takes your years of iTunes listening and analyzes your tastes, then goes further, asking you about your preferences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>When you first use it, you see a screen of floating magenta circles (a survey tool Apple got when it bought Beats Music).</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>A tap on the Pop circle told Apple I like the hits, double taps on Classic Rock and Indie expressed my love for the good stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>And a press-and-hold on Metal said I hate the sounds of Megadeth and Metallica.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>You can tell Apple what you don't want to hear, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Immediately, the For You tab populated with fantastically curated and cleverly named pop and classic-rock playlists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>"Lying in a Hammock" captured my love for Cat Stevens and Bon Iver alike, while "Love Is Just a Lie" reminded me that it had been far too long since I'd listened to Dire Straits and Joni Mitchell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>(Apple: Even though I'm a big fan of your breakup mixes, I promise you I am happily married.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The page also recommended whole albums by Eric Clapton, Paul Simon, Taylor Swift, Sara Bareilles and Third Eye Blind, a near-perfect snapshot of my wide range of tastes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Those same albums are available on Spotify and Rdio, but they've never been recommended to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>And with so many millions of songs available, I never went looking for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>(Most of these services have virtually the same libraries, including almost every big name artist you're looking for, with the exception of The Beatles and Prince. Taylor Swift is only available in her entirety on Apple Music.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>In the week since Apple Music launched, I periodically missed Spotify's selection of acoustic playlists, but in the long term, what I may miss most are Spotify's social tools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>While you can create and share an Apple Music playlist on Twitter or Facebook, you can't follow friends or find fan-made playlists directly on the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>And Apple Music wasn't a perfect concierge, either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Despite me registering my dislike for country music, I continued to see playlists like "Redneck Women" and "Family-Friendly Country Songs" in my feed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>A week later, I'm still periodically offered some Carrie Underwood or Kenny Chesney.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Apple says the more feedback I give the service, the better it will get.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Even if Apple doesn't nail your tastes, that's just one slice of the pie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>There's the New tab, which is teeming with even more human-made playlists, top chart lists and music videos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>I spent a full hour this weekend getting happily lost in there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>The Radio tab lets you tune into Beats 1, the service's 24/7 global radio station hosted by some of the world's most famous DJs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>When I tuned in, I felt like I was at a club with a bunch of people I wasn't cool enough to hang with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Not to worry, there are over 50 other human-powered radio stations and a Pandora-like option for automated streams based off stuff you like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>As it stands right now, it's hard to give Apple Music my $10 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>I love how well it integrates with my own personal music collection, and recommends great music throughout the day, but there are too many bugs and frustrations to battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>And while it will work on my home Sonos speaker system, it doesn't yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>For now, my $10 feels better spent with Spotify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>I suspect this is really why Apple has given us all three months of free service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Not only does it let us see if streaming is even right for us, but it gives the company time to fix some issues before paying users get angry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>The real decision doesn't come now, but in three months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>And that may be all the time Apple needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>After all, when the second-gen iPod came out, I replaced my Rio with one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>I ended up loving it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>How badly has Apple screwed up?</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Ironically, the suggestions for Joanna are closer to what I would choose than the ones offered me on this, my newest, three months old, computer.Is that because it has a smallish iTunes library?Is Apple analyzing my decade plus of purchases for all my devices?Seems more likely it is looking at the wee library I've gotten around to putting on here.</td></tr>

<tr><td>86</td><td>Is that because it has a smallish iTunes library?</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Is Apple analyzing my decade plus of purchases for all my devices?</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Seems more likely it is looking at the wee library I've gotten around to putting on here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>So far, I'm more likely to finally spring for iTunes Match than subscribe to Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>I like what little I've heard of Beats 1, but not enough to pay $10 a month for it and perishable music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>I tend to listen to my own jazz and blues purchases ripped from CDs so I would only be listening to other genres anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>The first album Apple Music suggested was Van Morrison's "Moon Dance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>Already own it, of course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Its playing and a good companion for reading the WSJ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>One of my most used features on my iPhone was the Genius Mix.It took my library and mixed it based on similar songs, artists, or genres: mainstream rock, jazz, blues, new wave, classical, punk, etc. It was a great way to explore and enjoy my (growing again) personal catalog.Sadly it seems to have disappeared from the iPhone platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>Placed a call to Apple over the weekend, and they didn't seem to know that Genius Mixes were gone, or even be able to help me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Not interested in spending $10/month to rent music and was perfectly happy with iTunes Match and Genius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Match let me custom mix stations and stream based on artists, songs, or genres too and was wonderfully fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>C'est la vie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>"If you're a music nerd with an insatiable thirst for fresh sounds, the latest releases, and new artists, Spotify is lightyears ahead of Apple Music. If you're not that into discovering new music and like to stick to what you know, Apple Music does a great job at keeping you in your musical comfort zone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>Joanna is a journalist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>That's really all you need to know when you read what she writes about technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>@John Bumgarner That and it seems that the Media no matter who they are just love to dog Apple for some reason...maybe its because there a Great company and have Hoards of Cash that makes most "Journalist" Jealous for some odd reason unbeknownst to this guy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>Disclaimer I own Apple Stock however I'd still have said what I said regardless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>No mention of Pandora, the #1 internet radio provider????</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>@Al Sunday This article was written for Apple fanboys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>No need to overwhelm them with established alternatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>Cue the millions of dumb Apple users lining up to pay for stolen music they could listen to on the radio and for which they're providing all their personal data in the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>There's an Apple user born every minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>Your review managed to put a happy, positive spin on what you state is a very flawed service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>I suppose we have to expect that because Apple is such a big client of WSJ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>@RICHARD HAYES It's just Joanna Stern.Apple products are always magical while anything else delivered from any other company is excoriated for minor issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>@RICHARD HAYES It's just Joanna Stern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>Apple products are always magical while anything else delivered from any other company is excoriated for minor issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>I think that any review of this new "magic" that Apple is foisting upon it's largely ignorant customer base should at LEAST mention Google Music - the service that Apple took a look at and said "yes, this is what we have to copy almost exactly."</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>@Thaddeus Pecorak She didn't even mention Android- a place where the service isn't available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>I am not sure she knows it's real.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>@Matt McKnight @Thaddeus Pecorak - More likely you were so eager to criticize the review you didn't read it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>The Android platform is described as getting Apple Music in the future in this article.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>Thank you for the review, but I am disappointed to find grammar errors in the WSJ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>The work used to be much better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>Are the editors paying attention?</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>Just before reading your article, I spent five minutes trying to figure out how to play all the songs in my library in shuffle mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>I managed to do it by accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>I have no use for the new app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>Miss the old one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>And of course, many people will forget to cancel at the end of the three months and a year later will realize Apple's been pulling $10/month out of their pocket because they absent-mindedly hit "yes" to a request to do automatic billing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>Maybe I'm just too old, but really the social media and "recommendations" don't mean a thing to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>129</td><td>My favorite album I've discovered this year is the Palma Violets "Danger in the Club".</td></tr>
<tr><td>130</td><td>no music services recommended it to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>131</td><td>Instead, every week I check out allmusic.com, look for new music reviews and add those albums that sound interesting to my playlist on google play - and I'll pick multiple genres, not just those an algorithm will think I'll enjoy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>132</td><td>More work, yes, but it also it's how i discovered new music in my youth - except I don't have to waste $5.99 on a new album I'll listen to once!</td></tr>
<tr><td>133</td><td>Apple Music is good for one thing...they released the Stones performance of Sticky Fingers at the Fonda in LA earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>134</td><td>I appreciate the review since I'm sitting on the fence thinking about "another" subscription service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>135</td><td>Since I'm chucking SirusXM shortly and have been using Pandora (ad supported) since it first came out ... learned music lists have been great although not much new music (maybe just my tastes?) I'm curious why you only mentioned Spotify when comparing to Apple Music?</td></tr>
<tr><td>136</td><td>I feel she's a bit too willing to smile and overlook problems with the software and service that she would pan others (Spotify, Rdio, etc) for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>137</td><td>Also, for the majority of listeners who do not use iTunes, I imagine that Apple Music will not have nearly as good of predictive capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>138</td><td>And that includes most people I know, including heavy iPhone users (Spotify and Pandora long ago displaced Apple's music offerings for them).</td></tr>
<tr><td>139</td><td>@Dan Jamieson Actually, the whole ITunes thing is why I don't have anything to do with IPod.</td></tr>
<tr><td>140</td><td>I considered buying one a few months ago when my latest Sansa died, and asked the nice young man at the store whether I could download my collection of ripped CDs to the IPod.</td></tr>
<tr><td>141</td><td>He looked dumbfounded, and then said there must be a way to do it through ITunes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>142</td><td>I bought another Sansa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>143</td><td>Deezer is my favorite....integrates with Sonos and a better (higher definition) than Apple and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>144</td><td>I pretty much have this already with my amazon prime account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>145</td><td>Which also has a streaming video library.</td></tr>
<tr><td>146</td><td>@Alan Maxwell But but it's NOT Apple, you see?</td></tr>
<tr><td>147</td><td>@Alan Maxwell Me too and a long time already but you know, Apple fan boys (and girls) run the WSJ tech review.They consistently ignore or downplay products by other companies while praising all things Apple whether they deserve it or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>148</td><td>@Alan Maxwell Me too and a long time already but you know, Apple fan boys (and girls) run the WSJ tech review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>149</td><td>They consistently ignore or downplay products by other companies while praising all things Apple whether they deserve it or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>150</td><td>Apple Music is just a me-too music service, nothing innovating or different than what Amazon, Spotify, Pandora, Slacker and many others have been doing for months or years now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>151</td><td>Amazon Music with Prime for instance couple with Amazon Echo do the same, Alexa being Siri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>152</td><td>@Juan Carlos de Cardenas @Alan Maxwell - You are wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>153</td><td>The advantage of Apple Music, as Joanna says, is its full integration of streaming, radio, music you have ripped to your iTunes library and purchasing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>154</td><td>No other service offers all of that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>155</td><td>Nor has the reviewer categorically praised Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>She says it is a work in progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>157</td><td>The major aspect that needs to be fixed is confusing menus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>158</td><td>I also look forward to Apple Music working with computer voice assistants - whether Siri, Google Voice or Microsoft's upcoming Cortana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>159</td><td>The key attribute needed to write refviews is fairmindedness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>160</td><td>Joanna Stern has it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>161</td><td>You do not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>162</td><td>@Jamilla Graves @Juan Carlos de Cardenas @Alan Maxwell Jamilla, I am not wrong, Amazon Music with Prime fully integrates the music I own, including my whole CD collection uploaded with streaming services (of which radio-like playlists are just but a variant).</td></tr>
<tr><td>163</td><td>So no, Apple has not done anything new and from what Joanna wrote is not even a more rounded product than Amazon Music (which also have a lot of issues with menus and the way of organizing the library).</td></tr>
<tr><td>164</td><td>"For the price of a new album and a half every month, you can rent our playlist every month instead!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>165</td><td>Just awful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>166</td><td>For 180 bucks a year, I can buy a song every other day and actually own it myself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>167</td><td>Not for me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>168</td><td>I listen to music in the evening in physical form (CD's and vinyl)....superior quality and I don't need someone to tell me what I should be listening to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>169</td><td>a fair review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>170</td><td>I am not ready for music streaming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>171</td><td>I love my ipod.</td></tr>
<tr><td>172</td><td>I also love Sirius, I'm good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>173</td><td>@BONNIE CARAWAN Kind of the same for me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>174</td><td>Pandora (free) and iTunes radio are cool for me along with my iTunes library.</td></tr>
