<h3>Thousands of Greek miners protest feared job losses</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>About 4,000 workers at a northern Greek gold mine and their supporters are demonstrating in Athens, in the most significant labor challenge the new radical left-led government has faced since its election in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Protesters fear job losses because the governing Syriza party has fought the privately-owned mine on environmental and financial grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Authorities have temporarily revoked a permit for a key ore enrichment plant at the Skouries mine, and accuse the mining company of encouraging the protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police closed major roads as miners marched to the Development Ministry Thursday, where they shouted slogans and banged their hard hats on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The protesters were later planning to march to Parliament, while a counter-protest by leftists and anarchists who oppose the gold mine was planned for later in the day.</td></tr>
