<h3>Few precedents seen as Germanwings investigation points to deliberate crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>If Andreas Lubitz, Germanwings flight 9525's 27-year-old co-pilot, was determined to kill himself, he would not be the first to use an aeroplane as a tool for self-destruction or to kill others in the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, "aircraft-assisted pilot suicides," as the Federal Aviation Administration calls them, are rare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They include the November 2013 crash of a Mozambique Airlines plane bound for Luanda, Angola, that bears an eerie resemblance to the Germanwings plane's demise - when the flight's co-pilot left to use the toilet, the captain locked him out of the cockpit and manually steered the aircraft earthward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Officials said the co-pilot could be heard on the plane's black box recorder, knocking on the cockpit door.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The crash of Egypt Airlines Flight 990 off Nantucket in 1999, which killed 203 passengers, was also deliberate, a National Transportation Safety Board investigation concluded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A relief pilot, Gameel al-Batouti, waited for the captain to leave the cockpit and then disengaged the autopilot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As the plane descended, he could be heard saying in Arabic, "I rely on God," over and over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz: police are investigating a personal-life crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A 2014 study conducted for the FAA showed that of 2,758 aviation accidents recorded by the agency from 2003 to 2012, only eight were determined to be suicides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The pilots of all the flights were male, the study found, and ranged in age from 21 to 68, although they tended toward middle age.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Four had been drinking and two were taking antidepressant drugs at the time of the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Five had given hints of their intentions to others before their final flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One of the cases involved a 45-year-old pilot who had a history of depression and at least one recent suicide attempt that he had not disclosed to the FAA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Witnesses observed the plane heading straight for the ground shortly after takeoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In another case, a 47-year-old student pilot who was involved in a custody dispute took off in a Cessna 150 with a child as a passenger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After flying for an hour and half, the plane headed back for the airport but then took a steep dive, crashing into the pilot's ex-mother-in-law's house.The pilot and the child both died in the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Airline officials have said that Lubitz passed the medical and psychological tests required by the airline "with flying colours" but acknowledged an unexplained gap of a few months in his training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Experts on suicide say that the psychology of those who combine suicide with mass murder may differ significantly from those who limit themselves to taking their own lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A pilot who crashes a plane carrying hundreds of passengers is probably more like the perpetrator of a mass shooting, said Michelle Cornette, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"This is not so different in some ways from someone who walks into a school and kills a bunch of people, and then kills themselves," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cornette said that it was entirely possible that someone who was suicidal could pass psychological exams and receive a clean bill of health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"People know what's going to raise a red flag," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Germanwings Airbus A320 crash: Co-pilot Andreas...</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>Germanwings: Andreas Lubitz breakdown six years...</td></tr>
