<h3>Venezuela opposition urges release of mayor accused of coup plot</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Intelligence agents took Caracas metropolitan Mayor Antonio Ledezma from his office on Thursday and were holding the veteran politician at their Helicoide headquarters while a judge decides if he will be formally charged, supporters said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"He's in good spirits and very optimistic of demonstrating that he has no links with any wrongdoing," his lawyer, Omar Estacio, said after a brief visit to Ledezma with his wife Mitzy early on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ledezma, 59, is the highest-profile Maduro opponent in custody after fellow opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who was arrested a year ago for his role in street protests that brought four months of violence and led to the death of 43 Venezuelans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dubbed "The Vampire" by Maduro supporters, the mayor allied himself with opposition radicals last year in supporting the street campaign dubbed the "La Salida" or "The Exit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Maduro called the 2014 violence a coup attempt against his socialist government, and officials said last week Ledezma was among various politicians supporting a new plot with dissident military officers to topple the president via air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Their coup d'etat failed," Maduro said late on Thursday, announcing Ledezma's detention to applause from supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Every fascist gets found out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The primary evidence presented by the government was a public document signed by Ledezma and two other opposition leaders urging a transition, which officials call a roadmap for a coup but which opponents term a political strategy paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Opposition leaders, who planned to gather in a Caracas square on Friday to demand Ledezma's release, called the case a smokescreen to distract Venezuelans from a recession, the highest inflation in the Americas and widespread scarcities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Maduro, 52, a former union activist, bus driver and long-serving foreign minister, has seen his popularity plummet since he narrowly won election in 2013 to replace Hugo Chavez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"With this new sweep, the government is radicalizing and polarizing again, and turning the country's attention away from the economy," said Ramon Muchacho, another opposition mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Although opposition leaders lampoon Maduro's coup allegations, there is a history of plotting against Venezuela's socialist government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For example, the United States endorsed a brief-lived coup against Chavez in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some radical activists acknowledge the existence of an underground movement bent on toppling Maduro, and recently detained student radical Lorent Saleh surfaced in a government-broadcast video praising Ledezma as "an old fox ... the politician who has most supported the resistance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However, Ledezma and other prominent opposition repeatedly deny any illegal behavior, urging both Maduro's resignation and a resounding vote against his ruling Socialist Party in upcoming parliamentary elections later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Washington, which recently slapped sanctions on some Venezuela officials, again denied trying to destabilize the South American OPEC nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Deeply concerned by what appears to be escalation of intimidation of opponents by government of Venezuela," Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson said via Twitter on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The only way to solve problems of Venezuela is through real dialogue among Venezuelans - not attempting to silence critics."</td></tr>

<h3>Exclusive: U.S. lawmaker pushes White House to aid allies in Islamic State fight</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a letter to Obama, Kay Granger, chairwoman of the House of Representatives State and Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, said Egypt needs F-16 aircraft, M1A1 Abrams tanks and other weapons that have been held up since 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Granger has the power to place holds on foreign aid, including general assistance and weapons shipments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Granger urged the administration to give Iraqi Kurds tools and training to fight Islamic State and to make providing weapons to Jordan a priority, according to the letter, seen by Reuters on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dated Thursday, the letter criticized the administration as Congress is about to consider Obama's request for formal authority for a military campaign against Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Republicans, who took control of the U.S. Congress in January, have pressed for more robust U.S. military involvement in fighting the militants, who have killed thousands of civilians while seizing territory in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"As Egypt, Jordan, and the Kurds retaliate and defend themselves against ISIL's heinous acts, U.S. security assistance is being held or delayed by bureaucratic processes and ill-advised policy decisions by your administration," Granger wrote, using an acronym for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The U.S. State Department referred requests for comment to the White House, where officials did not immediately respond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Granger said she was calling on the White House to "immediately release" remaining weapons and funds to Egypt, provide Jordan with weapons it had requested and ensure the Kurdish Peshmerga have equipment they need.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I am prepared to do everything within my power to make sure this occurs, including placing holds on Congressional Notifications (spending plans) and drafting legislation to hold your Administration accountable," Granger wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Egyptian warplanes bombed sites in Libya on Monday in response to the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians by Islamic State militants there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Lockheed Martin Corp , which makes the F-16, said the aircraft built for Egypt were part of a foreign military sales agreement between the United States and Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Twelve of 20 F-16s built by Lockheed under its last contract with Egypt are in storage at Lockheed's Fort Worth, Texas, facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They have been formally transferred to the U.S. government, which is paying Lockheed to store and maintain them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The current U.S. policy on Egypt is to hold up many shipments of big-ticket weapons until Washington can certify that Cairo has made progress on human rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Granger represents the district where Lockheed's facility is based, but the company would not necessarily profit from a move to release the planes since the U.S. government has already paid Lockheed for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>U.S. officials said last week that planning was well under way to help replenish Jordan's supplies of ordnance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Jordan's King Abdullah visited Congress earlier this month, the same day Islamic State released a video of the murder of a Jordanian pilot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The administration has said it is supplying guns and ammunition to the Kurds, who are fighting Islamic State in northern Iraq, but it is channeling them through Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Some Republicans have said the supplies should go directly to the Kurds.</td></tr>
