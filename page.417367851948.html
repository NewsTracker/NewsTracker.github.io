<h3>Apple buys German augmented-reality software maker Metaio</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A man looks at his Apple iPad in front an Apple logo outside an Apple store in downtown Shanghai March 16, 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FRANKFURT Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has acquired Metaio, a German company whose technology melds real-world imagery and computer-generated elements into moving video presentations, according to a corporate filing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Metaio's previous investors included Westcott LLC, the investment vehicle of entrepreneur Carl Westcott, the founder of floral delivery firm 1-800-Flowers (FLWS.O), and Atlantic Bridge, a Silicon Valley-based growth equity technology fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A document filed with a Munich court showed that Apple is now the company's sole shareholder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Metaio's augmented-reality software is used in applications in retail, industrial and automotive markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Metaio technology is used to create virtual product showrooms and by retailers such as IKEA [IKEA.UL].</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It has also created visual manuals for repairing complex industrial or automotive equipment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Augmented reality is software that overlays text or graphics on real-life images and objects, typically in video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The result can be viewed on TV displays, smartphones, tablets or dedicated eye-goggles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It differs from virtual reality, which replaces real-world views with more or less completely simulated ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Steffen Sorrell, an analyst with technology market research firm Juniper Research, said Apple, which builds custom computer chips it uses in a range of products, could incorporate Metaio's intellectual property to differentiate its products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This could give Apple a jump on rivals who are working to develop augmented reality semiconductors but remain at least 18 to 24 months away from delivery, the analyst said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This technology was co-developed with ST-Ericsson, the former joint venture between mobile network equipment maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM.PA).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Potential applications using Metaio's low-power consumption technology could include mobile handsets and or smart-glasses, Sorrell speculated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In mobile phones, the Apple-Metaio combination could pose a challenge to current market leader Qualcomm (QCOM.O), which owns augmented reality maker Vuforia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Metaio executives didn't respond to requests for comment and Apple issued a statement but provided no details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not comment on our purpose or plans," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Westcott and Atlantic Bridge were not immediately available to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The roots of Munich-based Metaio go back to German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), where Thomas Alt, its co-founder and chief executive, began developing augmented-reality applications in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Jupiter estimates that augmented-reality technology used in enterprises will increase tenfold to $2.4 billion from $247 million last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Other companies in the emerging field include France's Total Immersion and UK-based Blippar, which last year bought Layar from the Netherlands.</td></tr>
