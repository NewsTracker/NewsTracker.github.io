<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, May 12 (Reuters) - A 7.3 magnitude earthquake killed at least 37 people and spread panic in Nepal on Tuesday, bringing down buildings already weakened by a devastating tremor less than three weeks ago and unleashing landslides in Himalayan valleys near Mount Everest.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Politicians dashed for the exit of Nepal's parliament building and office towers swayed as far away as central New Delhi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The tremors could be felt in Bangladesh and were followed by a series of powerful aftershocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Terrified Kathmandu residents crammed into public spaces, too nervous to venture inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I am very scared and I am with my two sons. The school building is cracked and bits of it, I can see they have collapsed," said Rhita Doma Sherpa, a nurse with the Mountain Medicine Center in Namche Bazaar, a departure point for trekkers headed to Everest.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>Nepal had barely begun to recover from the devastation caused by last month's 7.8-magnitude earthquake, the country's worst in more than 80 years, which killed at least 8,046 people and injured more than 17,800.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hundreds of thousands of buildings, including ancient Hindu and Buddhist temples, were destroyed and many more damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mountaineers seeking to scale the world's tallest peak have called off this year's Everest season after 18 people died when last month's quake triggered avalanches on the mountain.</td></tr>
