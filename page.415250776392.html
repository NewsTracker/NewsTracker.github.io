<h3>Lawmaker for Greek Nazi-inspired party on trial over attack during line TV talk show</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece - A lawmaker from a Nazi-inspired Greek party was acquitted Friday of a charge stemming from an attack on two female left-wing colleagues during a live TV talk show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Athens court found that Ilias Kassidiaris did not cause the women grievous bodily harm, as he had been charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>TV footage of the 2012 incident showed Kassidiaris repeatedly slapping one woman and throwing a glass of water at another before running away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attack followed an exchange of verbal abuse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The defendant is one of several Golden Dawn lawmakers held in pre-trial custody on separate charges for allegedly running a criminal organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Judges ruled Friday that the attack was not as severe as described in the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kassidiaris was not convicted of plain assault, because that would have required a formal complaint from his victims, that was never made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>About 100 supporters of Golden Dawn - now Greece's third largest party - gathered outside the courthouse in a show of support.</td></tr>
