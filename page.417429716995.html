<h3>Morrison flags suspended citizenship</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cabinet minister Scott Morrison has backed suspending the citizenship of Australians who fight alongside Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott is facing a backlash over a plan to allow the immigration minister to strip dual nationals of their citizenship if they are found to be supporting extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While some members of the cabinet say it breaches long-held legal rights and could render people stateless, nearly 40 backbenchers say it does not go far enough and sole Australian citizens should also be covered by the law change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Morrison, the former immigration minister who is now in the social services portfolio, said a way forward could be allowing temporary suspension of citizenship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"In the same way as if someone goes to prison they don't get to vote," he told 2GB radio on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"They are still a citizen but there is an entitlement of citizenship which is suspended for a period of time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There was a very high risk that people returning from terrorist hot spots would get involved in terrorist activity at home, Mr Morrison said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Liberal backbencher Dan Tehan, who chairs parliament's intelligence and security committee, says there is a strong feeling among the backbench that the government should look seriously at British laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In the UK the government can strip a person of their citizenship if they commit or advocate terrorist acts, provided there are reasonable grounds to believe a person won't be rendered stateless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"What this enables in very rare circumstances, where your intelligence agencies and others have provided clear proof to the minister, then the minister can take action," Mr Tehan said of the UK laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It is something that has been used very judiciously in the UK and there are judicial safeguards in place."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek said leaks from cabinet about a rift over the issue showed it should "ring some alarm bells" in the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We don't know who will be making the determination, we don't know the circumstances in which it would be determined, we don't know what appeal mechanisms there might be," Ms Plibersek said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Abbott told reporters in Canberra the government would respect the rule of law in any changes that are made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"That's at the heart of our civilisation and that's why the changes which we are proposing to strip citizenship from terrorists who are dual nationals will be subject to judicial review and they won't be done to render anyone stateless," he said.</td></tr>
