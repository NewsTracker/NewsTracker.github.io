<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>France's TV5Monde television channel has resumed full operations after an "unprecedented" hack by self-proclaimed Islamic State militants, who shut down transmissions and hijacked its website and social networks to protest against French military action in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Authorities said the hack was likely a "terrorist act" and urged media companies to be "vigilant", warning that further attacks could not be ruled out.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>"There are a lot of factors suggesting that a terrorist attack was behind this," he told a news conference.</td></tr>
