<h3>Forest fire threatens Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear zone</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KIEV - Emergency services were battling on Tuesday to prevent Ukraine's largest forest fire since 1992 from spreading towards the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Earlier, the interior ministry had warned that high winds were blowing the fire in northern Ukraine towards Chernobyl, where in 1986 a reactor fire led to the world's worst nuclear disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A 30 km (18.6 miles) exclusion zone remains in place around the plant, which remains contaminated by radioactive particles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The situation is being controlled, but this is the biggest fire since 1992. We've not had this scale of fire," Ukraine's Interfax news agency reported Yatseniuk as telling journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is around 20 kilometres (from the fire) to the plant. Our emergency services are actively working there to prevent the fire spreading further," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In February, international experts warned that a large amount of dangerous isotopes remained in the forests near Chernobyl, which could be spread by forest fires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chernobyl's Reactor 4, the epicentre of the 1986 blast, is covered with a concrete casement that the Ukrainian authorities plan to replace by 2016.</td></tr>
