<tr><td>3</td><td>Egypt's deposed longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak celebrated his 87th birthday Monday by waving to some 100 supporters gathered outside of the military hospital where he is being held in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The crowd held up photos of Mubarak, played music and praised him, days before an expected May 9 verdict in his retrial on corruption charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An appeals court overturned the last remaining conviction against Mubarak in January, leaving no other legal reason for detaining the ailing former leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The corruption case concerns charges that Mubarak and his two sons embezzled millions of dollars of state money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The funds were meant to pay for renovating and maintaining presidential palaces but instead allegedly were spent on upgrading the family's private homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Another court cleared Mubarak in November of the biggest case against him - responsibility for the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile, hundreds of the young activists from that time are either languishing in prison on charges of breaking a protest law or have left the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The rise of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who has vowed stability after four years of turmoil and taken a tough line against dissent, has encouraged Mubarak supporters and upended the depiction of the revolution in the media, where activists now are most often cast as troublemakers or foreign agents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mubarak's successor, Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, himself was overthrown by the military in 2013 and was sentenced to 20 years in prison last month for using force against protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Meanwhile, images of Mubarak's son and onetime heir apparent, Gamal, making public appearances have circulated on social media, first at a funeral last month and then last weekend with his family at the Giza pyramids.</td></tr>
