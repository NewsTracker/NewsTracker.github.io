<h3>Woman who snatched baby Zephany Nurse is banned from seeing child</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 50-year-old was ordered to live at a secret address isolated from the girl she'd brought up and the husband she'd deceived when she appeared in court following her arrest for kidnapping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yesterday the biological mother of Zephany Nurse who was snatched from her arms in hospital in April 1997, thanked the stranger who had brought her up for 'doing a good job' in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Today Celeste and Morne Nurse were forced to stand in the packed Cape Town Magistrates Court as the seamstress who had stolen their three day old baby was granted bail with strict conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The stout middle-aged woman, wearing an animal print t-shirt and black leggings, dabbed her eyes with a tissue as magistrate Grant Engel warned her to stay away from the daughter and husband she'd deceived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The seamstress, from a poverty-stricken suburb of Cape Town, looked grief-stricken but managed to smile weakly at a clutch of friends who had gathered to support her in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Outside court, Judith Wasserfall, a neighbour of the accused was emotional as she recalled the day her friend had brought her baby girl home from hospital in April 1997.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'We were so thrilled for her, she looked so happy,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'We have watched that child grow up, what a lovely girl she is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'We helped change her nappies and she was so cute and smiley, everyone loved her, she played with my own daughters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'As a mother and child they just seemed just to fit together - like a proper family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The mother is a lovely, lovable woman, always smiling and kind and will do anything for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'We are all just in shock, and pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Now the house is empty, and we miss them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'It was the husband who came to tell us what had happened, when she had been arrested for kidnap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>My knees went weak, I felt numb when he told us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'He looked shocked, broken, he didn't know a thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Zephany, who was given a different name by the woman - neither of whom can be identified - is being cared for by social workers and has met her biological family three times since discovering her real identity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It is understood she has also seen the man she thought of as her father, who was in court but unable to answer any questions, only shaking his head in apparent shock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The girl, who turns 18 next month, learned she had been stolen at birth following an extraordinary twist of fate when her long lost sister, 13-year-old Cassidy Nurse, joined her school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Once Morne, 37, learned of his daughter's new older friend 'who looks just like us', he sought her out and immediately felt an inexplicable bond with the girl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The electrical sales rep then carried out his own investigation into the 17-year-old, scanning her Facebook page for information which would help prove she was the three-day-old baby who'd been taken from his sleeping wife's arms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Precious: The family only have a few photos of Zephany taken before she was snatched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The father of four told MailOnline, 'When I saw Zephany for the first time the feeling was there completely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'I looked at her and I don't know what it was, but I fell in love with my daughter when I saw her, I thought 'wow what is this feeling?' I don't know how to express myself, it was confusion, attraction, confusion, it was everything all in one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He downloaded a picture of the woman who was raising Zephany from the girl's Facebook page and sent it to a witness who had seen the woman, dressed in a nurse's uniform, carrying the baby away from Celeste as she slept, heavily medicated following a Cesarean section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>She confirmed that it was the kidnapper she had seen at the Groote Schuur Hospital more than 17 years before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Morne also sent a photograph of the girl to Celeste, 36, who immediately recognised her as Zephany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'When he sent me the photo I burst into tears, she looked exactly like Cassidy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She had the same face, ear lobes, nose, she was the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I said 'this is my daughter'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Once they were satisfied that they had enough evidence, they contacted police who carried out DNA tests and proved they had traced their own child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>During the short court hearing, the accused did not look in the direction of Morne and Celeste - who are now divorced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Both families have lived only streets apart for all of Zephany's life and the poverty-stricken community of Lavender Hill, where drugs and gangs are rife, are divided over the extraordinary story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>It is understood that the baby snatcher had had a still birth before she took Zephany and was able to breastfeed the newborn and bring her home from hospital without raising suspicion, even from her own husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The packed, wood-pannelled court heard that the accused is in 'precarious health', and is understood to suffer from diabetes and a heart condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Prosecutor Bonnie Currie-Gamwo did not oppose the application for bail, which was set at 350 pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The woman will have to report to the police station near to her new address which was not revealed in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Releasing the woman on bail, Mr Engel ordered her to ' make no contact directly or indirectly with any witnesses in this matter, including the child'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He specified that this included 'via Facebook, social media, whatsapp, or sending any messages with third parties'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>She is next due to appear in court on May 29.</td></tr>

<h3>3 reasons Apple's watch will _ or won't _ change the game</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>9, 2014 file photo, the new Apple Watch is modeled during a media event in Cupertino, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted the wearable gadget will be as game-changing as Apple's revolutionary iPhones and iPads, which have become indispensable accessories for millions around the globe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - No one can argue that Apple has changed the way people live their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company's iPod, iTunes, iPhone and iPad have shaken up music, phone and computer markets worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Is the Apple Watch going to be able to do the same?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The stakes are big for Apple CEO Tim Cook: the watch is the first brand-new Apple product to be launched without legendary co-founder Steve Jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the market is awash in smartwatches that have gained little traction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Here are three reasons the Apple Watch will finally move the needle in the smartwatch industry - and three reasons it might not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>MORE FEATURES THAN RIVALS: Along with email, texts and phone calls, Apple says its watch will present news, health readings and other notifications in creative ways that can be read at a glance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It will have a heart rate monitor and accelerometer, and an internal motor that can signal the wearer with a subtle "tap" on the wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And Siri and Apple Pay will be built in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple is working with outside companies to create more apps; Cook has talked about using the watch as an electronic "key" for hotel doors or even cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A POWERFUL BRAND: The world's biggest tech company has a reputation for quality and a direct conduit to customers - it operates more than 400 retail stores around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>And it has deep pockets to spend on advertising - it is showcasing the watch this month with a sleek, 12-page insert in Vogue and other fashion magazines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>APPLE'S TRACK RECORD: This wouldn't be the first Apple product that revolutionized a market where rivals had struggled to break through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Other companies made digital music players before the iPod, smartphones before the iPhone and even tablets before the iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Most of those products failed to catch on until Apple made devices so appealing they set new standards and created new demand, said Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>WHAT'S THE NEED?: Most smartwatches - including Apple's - only work with a smartphone nearby, so you can't swap one expensive gadget for the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"What we've seen is that it's not obvious why people would want a smartwatch," says Gownder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A recent Forrester survey found some respondents didn't see a reason to buy one because they already owned a less-expensive fitness band or a full-featured smartphone (although it also found Apple fans ready to buy the new watch).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>CONSUMERS NOT EXCITED: You can already buy smartwatches made by giant tech companies like Samsung, Sony or LG, or from a tech startup like Pebble, that track your heart rate, show you email and deliver other online services to your wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>None of them have really caught on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Only about 5 million smartwatches were sold worldwide last year, according to market researchers at Strategy Analytics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>By comparison, Apple sold 74.6 million iPhones in just the last quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>PRICE AND OBSOLESCENCE: Many of today's smartwatches sell for $200 or less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Apple plans to sell three models, starting at $349, but Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster predicts the average buyer will pay $550 for a watch and extra, interchangeable bands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Apple's high-fashion "Edition" model, made with 18-karat gold, is expected to cost thousands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>While affluent consumers might pay that for a watch they can wear for years, or even hand down to their children, it's a lot of money for something that could become outdated if Apple releases a new model every year or so - as it does with smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Cook will make his case for the Apple Watch at a press event Monday, where he's expected to show off more features and apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Expectations are high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But even the iPhone didn't become a mainstream blockbuster in its first year, notes Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Of the Apple Watch, he says, "people need to understand more about what this product is, and what it does, and I think that will evolve over time."</td></tr>
