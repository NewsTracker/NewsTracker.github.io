<h3>Review: Small life enhancements come with Apple Watch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Apple Watch isn't so much a lifestyle revolution as it is a collection of small enhancements that add up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple's smartwatch has a wider range of apps than rival watches from Samsung, Motorola and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In my few weeks with one, I've been following my favorite baseball team more closely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I've walked to places without staring at a phone screen for directions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>I've even stepped away from my desk more often - despite my annoyance at the watch for nagging me to move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>You'll find ways to use it if you decide to spend $349 or more on one, though that isn't saying you absolutely need one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Think of it as a Swiss Army knife with a collection of tools that don't seem necessary - until you find yourself using them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Notifications are central to the watch experience, whether that's a new message, breaking news or a score change involving the New York Mets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In some cases, I can dictate a reply or select a pre-written response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The current temperature appears on my chosen watch face with Mickey Mouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>I glance at the watch throughout the day, but I need the phone for anything deep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Though I like not having to constantly pull out my phone, I have to resist feeling that everything's urgent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When the watch dinged during a massage, I held out for just a few seconds before the temptation to check took over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It was easier to resist with the phone in the backpack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It's a tricky balance getting the watch to enhance your life, rather than take it over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>With Apple Pay on iPhones, I'm able to leave my wallet in my pocket to pay at several chains, including McDonald's and Whole Foods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>With the watch, I'm able to leave my phone in the pocket, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The watch can also generate barcodes for Starbucks' payment card, Fandango movie tickets and boarding passes for some airlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I don't have to fish for paper or a phone while carrying luggage or popcorn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But if the merchant's scanner isn't hand-held or adjustable, you might have to twist your wrist to align the barcode with the scanner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Or your wrist might not fit under the scanner at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While fitness trackers typically focus on counting steps, Apple Watch tracks calories burned and minutes of exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It also pushes you to stand up and move around throughout the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Three colorful rings display your progress, turning fitness into a game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Apps from outside parties offer additional features, such as a record of the route you ran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>I was worried that promised battery life is just 18 hours, given that I tax the watch and its heart-rate sensor with heavy exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But I haven't had problems as long as I charge it overnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It's not designed for sleep tracking, as dedicated fitness devices such as Fitbit do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Offsetting the health benefits: I can use the Remote app to control video on Apple TV instead of getting up to grab the physical remote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I can also control the phone's camera for selfies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Parents with kids can set timers remotely for Nick Jr. and PBS Kids - and end arguments over screen time and bedtime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In many cases, I need to assemble features from multiple apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>For walking and driving directions, Apple's Maps taps my wrist when it's time to make a turn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But it doesn't do transit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Citymapper does, but lacks turn-by-turn navigation to get to the subway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It's back to Apple Maps for that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>There no Facebook or any Google apps yet, though you get notifications that normally go to the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Facebook's Instagram is available and lets you like photos, but limits commenting to 24 emoticons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>I'm continually learning about new apps, including Evernote for dictating reminders and other notes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It'll take time for app developers to write the capabilities and for me to discover them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>It'll also take time to fully get used to all the gestures and controls, though I was much better at it after a few days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>I have to remind myself that the Apple Watch is a first-generation product that's giving me a lot I didn't have before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>With other smartwatches, I'm happy just to get basic functionality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Apple Watch is good at the basics, so I'm now demanding more.</td></tr>
