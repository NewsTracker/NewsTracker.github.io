<h3>Kyrie Irving hits career high in Texas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Irving, who is no stranger to the NBA's 50-point club, inked his name in the record books with a performance that earned him the highest score of the season and the best total by a visiting player against San Antonio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He single-handedly kept the Cavs in the game too, making a brilliant catch and shoot three-pointer off an inbounds pass in the dying seconds, to send the game to overtime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Irving found his stroke on a night when the Cavs showed the NBA they are a serious title contender.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He made seven of seven three-pointers as well as all 10 of his free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Irving may have got them to overtime, but it was he and LeBron James who dominated the play in the extra period, making shot after shot as the full-strength Spurs struggled to contain the Cavaliers on offence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Irving credited his teammates and their ability to get him open for his big night as well as Cleveland's defence down the stretch for the win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"All the credit goes to my teammates, they were doing a great job of screening me and keeping me open," Irving told TNT Sports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The defence down the stretch was huge, we got stops when we needed it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We were all tired going into that overtime, it was a great test for us... glad we came out of it with the win."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While Mills was on the end of the Irving three-athon, it was a good night for fellow Australians Dante Exum and Joe Ingles as their Utah Jazz upset the Houston Rockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Exum and Ingles chipped in 10 points apiece as the Jazz shocked the high-flying Rockets 109-91.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Exum also grabbed five boards in the win as Utah dominated the Dwight Howard-less Rockets in the paint with Rudy Gobert starring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Jazz centre Gobert had 19 points, 22 rebounds and four blocks as the Jazz recorded their ninth victory in 11 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While it was a great night for the Jazz, it was one to forget for league MVP candidate James Harden, with the Rockets star scoring just 15 points and went three of 13 from the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Corey Brewer led the Rockets with 25 points, and James Harden had 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In Indiana, the Pacers continued their charge towards the Eastern Conference playoffs with a 109-93 overtime win over the Milwaukee Bucks.</td></tr>

<h3>ISIS accepts Boko Haram pledge, says would-be recruits can go to Nigeria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The development comes as both movements, which are among the most ruthless in the world, are under increasing military pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ISIS seized much of northern and western Iraq last summer giving it control of about a third of both Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But it is now struggling against Iraqi forces seeking to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, while coming under fire from U.S.-led coalition airstrikes in other parts of the country and in Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Boko Haram, meanwhile, has been weakened by a multinational force that has dislodged it from a score of northeastern Nigerian towns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But its new Twitter account, increasingly slick and more frequent video messages and a new media arm all were considered signs that the group is now being helped by ISIS propagandists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Then on Saturday, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau posted an audio recording online that pledged allegiance to ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On Thursday, ISIS's media arm Al-Furqan, in an audio recording by spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, said that Boko Haram's pledge of allegiance has been accepted, claiming the caliphate has now expanded to West Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Al-Adnani had urged foreign fighters from around the world to migrate and join Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We announce our allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims ... and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity, in hardship and ease, and to endure being discriminated against, and not to dispute about rule with those in power, except in case of evident infidelity regarding that which there is a proof from Allah," said the message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Peter Pham, director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, noted the Islamic State group's quick acceptance of Boko Haram's allegiance and said that the bond highlights a new risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Militants finding it increasingly harder to get to Syria and Iraq may choose instead to go to northeastern Nigeria and internationalize that conflict," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Boko Haram pledge of allegiance to ISIS comes as the militants reportedly were massing in the northeastern Nigerian town of Gwoza, considered their headquarters, for a showdown with the Chadian-led multinational force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Boko Haram killed an estimated 10,000 people last year, and it is blamed for last April's abduction of more than 275 schoolgirls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Thousands of Nigerians have fled to neighbouring Chad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A Chadian soldier peers into a burnt armoured vehicle which they say belonged to insurgent group Boko Haram, on Feb. 26 in Gambaru, Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The group is waging a nearly six-year insurgency to impose Muslim Shariah law in Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It began launching attacks across the border into Cameroon last year, and this year its fighters struck in Niger and Chad in retaliation to their agreement to form a multinational force to fight the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Boko Haram followed the lead of ISIS in August by declaring an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria that grew to cover an area the size of Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>ISIS had declared a caliphate in vast swaths of territory that it controls in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Nigerian group has also followed ISIS in publishing videos of beheadings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The latest one, published March 2, borrowed certain elements from ISIS productions, such as the sound of a beating heart and heavy breathing immediately before the execution, according to SITE Intelligence Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In video messages last year, Boko Haram's leader sent greetings and praise to both ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and leaders of al-Qaeda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Boko Haram has never been an affiliate of al-Qaeda, some analysts surmise because al-Qaeda considers the Nigerians' indiscriminate slaughter of Muslim civilians as un-Islamic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Recent offensives have marked a sharp escalation by African nations against Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>An African Union summit agreed on sending a force of 8,750 troops to fight Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Military operations in Niger's east have killed at least 500 Boko Haram fighters since Feb. 8, Nigerien officials have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Members of the UN Security Council proposed Thursday that the international community supply money, equipment, troops and intelligence to a five-nation African force fighting Boko Haram.</td></tr>
