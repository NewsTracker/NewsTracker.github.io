<h3>Greece moves to sideline Varoufakis after reform talks fiasco</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, April 27 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Monday reshuffled his team handling talks with European and IMF lenders, a move widely seen as an effort to relegate embattled Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis to a less active role in negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An anti-austerity economist who has angered peers with his brash style, Varoufakis is facing calls to quit after returning from a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Riga isolated and empty-handed while Athens scrambles to avoid bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tsipras and senior aides publicly voiced support for Varoufakis at a meeting on Sunday and agreed the finance minister would supervise a new team negotiating a reforms deal with lenders, a government official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Deputy Foreign Minister Euclid Tsakalotos - a close Tsipras ally and soft-spoken economist liked by officials representing creditors - was appointed coordinator of the group, the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This would elevate him from his current position and give him a more active role in the negotiations, pushing Varoufakis to the sidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The latest developments suggested Tsipras was ramping up efforts to ease tensions with lenders and strike a deal to unlock aid so Greece can avoid defaulting on payments, which could force it out of the 19-nation euro zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The news spurred a rally in Greek stocks and bonds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Greek two-year bond yields fell 250 basis points to a two-week low of 23.55 percent, reversing an earlier rise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Athens stocks rose 4 percent while Greek bank shares jumped 9 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are constantly making improvements to coordinate in a better way and have a more effective stance, because this is what people, the times and the negotiations demand," Tsakalotos told lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We are learning from our mistakes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Later on Monday, the government said it was preparing a bill to legislate reforms already presented to the lenders, in an effort to inject new momentum into the slow negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If the bill is voted, it could be the basis for an interim agreement," Varoufakis told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We are doing everything to achieve an honourable deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Euro zone officials welcomed the reshuffle and the apparent effort to reduce Varoufakis' role in negotiations with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The way he behaved made him an additional obstacle in the negotiations with Greece," said a euro zone official, who asked not to be identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"By diminishing his role, from the main contact person to one of the persons, removes the obstacle. It has become almost personal for some in the Eurogroup."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Another euro zone official questioned whether the move would bring about the substantive change lenders have been demanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Varoufakis, who became an instant celebrity in the early days of the Tsipras government with his tie-less look and blunt attack on austerity policies, has seen his star wane in recent weeks and critics have called him a liability in the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>At Riga on Friday, he was sharply criticised by fellow euro zone finance ministers for both his lecturing style and failure to produce reforms demanded by lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He was later taken to task by the media after he failed to appear at a state dinner after the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He responded by tweeting a quotation by former U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt which read: "They are unanimous in their hate for me; and I welcome their hatred."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In another move hinting at a less prominent role for Varoufakis, his general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, who had been leading technical-level talks with the so-called Brussels Group of lenders, will now focus on drawing up a plan for growth to be the basis for a new deal with lenders in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>George Chouliarakis, considered close to powerful deputy Prime Minister Yannis Dragasakis, will take over responsibility for talks with the Brussels group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In an effort to show that Athens is serious about giving lenders access to data, a new team was also set up to support EU and IMF officials gathering information in the Greek capital.</td></tr>
