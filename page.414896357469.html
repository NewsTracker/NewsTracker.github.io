<h3>WHO approves 15-minute Ebola test</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The World Health Organization (WHO) has approved the first rapid test for Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Corgenix's test is less accurate than the standard test but is easy to perform giving results within 15 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The WHO has assessed and listed the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit, developed by Corgenix Medical Corporation, as eligible for procurement to Ebola affected countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The test was evaluated under WHO's Emergency Assessment and Use, a procedure established to provide a minimum quality, safety and performance assurance for diagnostic products in the context of the Ebola emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This test is easy to use and perform, it does not require electricity, and can give results within 15 minutes," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasaravic said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The test by a German pharmaceutical company is easy to use and store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It comes at a time when Ebola infections in western Africa are on the rise again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, procurement and roll-out of the test kits will not begin immediately since the US company is still working out the test's costs and needs a week or two more to finish administrative procedures with the US Food and Drug Administration, Jasarevic said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ebola is currently being tested in laboratories largely through the detection of the virus's nucleic acid (genetic material), using commercial or in-house tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nucleic acid tests (NATs) are more accurate but are complex to use and require well-established laboratories and trained personnel, the WHO pointed out in its press release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Where possible, results from ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit should be confirmed by testing a new blood sample using an approved Ebola NAT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>More than 23,000 people, mainly in West Africa, have been infected in the outbreak and 9,300 have died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Doctors Without Borders has published a report on the Ebola outbreak which has claimed over 10,000 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The frontline aid agency has condemned the slow global response, particularly from the World Health Organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There is no way to tell when exactly the Ebola outbreak will be over in Africa, says Margaret Harris from the WHO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>International organizations learned too late about the spread of the disease, she noted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Just over two weeks after the release of its last known Ebola patient, Liberian officials have confirmed a new case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The hardest-stricken of three African nations has already lost over 4,000 lives to the deadly virus.</td></tr>
