<h3>Iraqi Kurds claim Islamic State group used chemical weapons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kurdish authorities in Iraq said Saturday they have evidence that the Islamic State group used chlorine gas as a chemical weapon against peshmerga fighters, the latest alleged atrocity carried out by the extremist organization now under attack in Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BAGHDAD (AP) - Kurdish authorities in Iraq said Saturday they have evidence that the Islamic State group used chlorine gas as a chemical weapon against peshmerga fighters, the latest alleged atrocity carried out by the extremist organization now under attack in Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The allegation by the Kurdistan Region Security Council, stemming from a Jan. 23 suicide truck bomb attack in northern Iraq, did not immediately draw a reaction from the Islamic State group, which holds a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, Iraqi officials and Kurds fighting in Syria have made similar allegations about the militants using the low-grade chemical weapons against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a statement, the council said the alleged chemical attack took place on a road between Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, and the Syrian border, as peshmerga forces fought to seize a vital supply line used by the Sunni militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It said its fighters later found "around 20 gas canisters" that had been loaded onto the truck involved in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Video provided by the council showed a truck racing down a road, white smoke pouring out of it as it came under heavy fire from peshmerga fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It later showed a white, billowing cloud after the truck exploded and the remnants of it scattered across a road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An official with the Kurdish council told The Associated Press that dozens of peshmerga fighters were treated for "dizziness, nausea, vomiting and general weakness" after the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to discuss the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Kurds say samples of clothing and soil from the site were analyzed by an unnamed lab in an unnamed coalition partner nation, which found chlorine traces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The fact ISIS relies on such tactics demonstrates it has lost the initiative and is resorting to desperate measures," the Kurdish government said in the statement, using an alternate acronym for the Sunni militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There was no independent confirmation of the Kurds' claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Peter Sawczak, a spokesman for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which has monitored Syria dismantling its chemical weapons stockpile, said his group had not been asked to investigate the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said American officials were aware of the Kurds' claim, though they had no information "regarding its veracity at this time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We find such allegations deeply disturbing, and if there are parties engaged in such use, they should be held appropriately accountable," Baskey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Chlorine, an industrial chemical, was first introduced as a chemical weapon at Ypres in World War I with disastrous effects as gas masks were not widely available at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>While chlorine has many industrial and public uses, as a weapon it chokes victims to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the Syrian civil war, a chlorine gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus in 2013 killed hundreds and nearly drove the U.S. to launch airstrikes against the government of embattled President Bashar Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The U.S. and Western allies accused Assad's government of being responsible for that attack, while Damascus blamed rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>There have been several allegations that the Islamic State group has used chlorine as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In October, Iraqi officials claimed Islamic State militants may have used chlorine-filled cylinders during clashes in late September in the towns of Balad and Duluiya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Their disclosures came as reports from the Syrian border town of Kobani indicated that the extremist group added chlorine to an arsenal that already includes heavy weapons and tanks looted from captured military bases.</td></tr>

<h3>Kissing Ring Of King Corn or Why Ethanol Ain't Going Away Anytime Soon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yes, I like oil and natural gas but I also find the technological innovation in solar, wind and other energy forms exciting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>If you are a regular reader, you will also know I am not a fan RFS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There are efforts to reform or outright appeal this very flawed law which Congress passed in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There are numerous reasons to oppose this law from economic to environmental.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Congressman Bob Goodlatte of Virgina introduced a bill in February of this year to eliminate corn-based ethanol: H.R. 704; The RFS Reform Act of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The bill has 45 co-sponsors; 38 Republicans and 7 Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The odds of this bill being approved by Congress: Nil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Here's why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Iowa Ag Summit held on the first weekend in March was well attended by most of the would be GOP contenders for their Presidential nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Also in attendance, Nan Swift of the National Taxpayers Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>What she witnessed prompted her to write, "For a group of candidates who ostensibly support free markets, it's amazing how only a few of them opted to affirm those values when it comes to agriculture policy broadly and the RFS in particular."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>You can read her blog post here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The short story, as she notes is this, only two of the GOP "contenders" outright called for an end to ethanol subsidies; Texas Senator Ted Cruz and former New York Governor George Pataki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Every one else kissed Big Corn's ring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As you can see from Goodlatte's bill, the Democrats are not any better about getting onboard toward reforming or outright eliminating the Renewable Fuel Standard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The reason is simple: MONEY.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Would you want to be running for election or re-election against an opponent who was awash in Big Ag money?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>All of that said, there is a vast coalition of opposition building against the RFS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Congress created the RFS in 2005 and the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for implementing the rules and regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The resulting chaos has even the Advanced Biofuels Association calling for reformation of the RFS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Now, the ABFA wants the standards tightened and the RFS strengthened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>For them, E15 (a fuel blend of 15% ethanol) is just the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They want to see fuels with even higher formulations of ethanol (think E85) so that their members have a forced marketplace for their products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>If you are unfamiliar with the argument against putting ANY ethanol in the tank of any engine, you might want to check out Jay Leno's column in Autoweek, Jay Leno Hates Ethanol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Now, just to be clear, not all ethanol is corn-based.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There is also a product known as Cellulosic ethanol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It is still ethanol just not food-based ethanol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This product gets past the ethical issues of using food products to create ethanol but it doesn't get past the science of why ethanol is an inferior product to gasoline; for starters, ethanol is not as energy dense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In other words it takes more ethanol to produce as much energy as gasoline and therefore costs consumers a lot more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>For a look at the economic cost to consumers as the blend of ethanol rises, check out the latest blog by Marlo Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That ABFA is at the other end of the spectrum from groups like the NTU or the Competitive Enterprise Institute which argue that the outrage of the RFS is that legislation requiring any one industry to buy product from another industry is as crazy as a market can get.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Marlo Lewis of the CEI is delighted by the diversity of those calling for the reform of the RFS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But he would very much like to see the law just go away because at its heart the RFS calls on the EPA to centrally plan a market years out which is economic folly in his opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Lewis even comes to the defense of the EPA saying what the original act requires the agency to do is impossible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>And, indeed, the EPA has been unable to set RFS standards for a few years now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It just keeps punting on the decision saying in effect, "next next year".</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Hopefully, with the progress being made on various forms of electricity generation and the rise of battery technology the debate over RFS can become mute.</td></tr>
