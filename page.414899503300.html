<h3>Koch brothers to team up with liberal groups to tackle prison reform</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Koch Industries, the behemoth company headed by the conservative political activist Koch brothers, has teamed up with liberal think tank the Centre for American Progress (CAP) and several other politically differing organizations to attempt tackling prison reform, the New York Times reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Along with the Kochs and CAP, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Faith and Freedom Coalition, FreedomWorks and others have formed a group called the Coalition for Public Safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The coalition will work to push bills to reduce prison populations, reform prison sentencing and cut back on recidivism in US prisons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The United States is home to 5 per cent of the world's population but makes up 25 per cent of the world's prison population - and sixty per cent of those in prison are racial and ethnic minorities," the coalition said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Over the last two decades, the federal prison population has increased an astounding 790 per cent - sixty per cent of those currently incarcerated in federal prisons are non-violent offenders - costing the American people $80 billion per year."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prison reform is one of the rare issues in US politics in which both sides share quite a bit of common ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Leaders of the groups in the coalition appear confident they can make progress on the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This Coalition demonstrates the growing bipartisan moment around criminal justice reform, and the urgency of this issue makes it important to see past any divisions in the fight to make progress," Neera Tanden, president of the CAP, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite this bipartisan effort, the Koch brothers have said they plan to spend $899 million on conservative interests in the 2016 presidential election.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td>"When a person wants to give everything and devote himself to something, as did the Heavenly Hundred, it can't be for nothing," he said, referring to the term that Ukrainians have adopted for those who died during months of protests in 2013-14 that led to the ouster of Ukraine's Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The grisliest day was a year ago Friday, when more than 50 people were killed by sniper fire on the capital's main square, known as Maidan.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>"We will stop the war and after a few years everyone will see how Ukraine has changed; we feel with every cell how the people demand that change be accelerated," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He vowed to fight the "fear, panic and mistrust" that he said "a neighboring state" was trying to sow in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Heated, contradictory allegations still surround the question of who fired the shots on Feb. 20, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Protesters and their supporters assert that the bullets came from rifles held by Ukrainian police or Russian marksmen to try to definitively put down the demonstrations against Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Their detractors allege radicals within the protest movement were responsible, purportedly willing to slaughter their own people to drive the political crisis to a breaking point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Poroshenko on Friday claimed Ukraine has evidence that Vladislav Surkov, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's advisers, organized the snipers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected the claim as "ravings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Whatever the intent, the gunfire helped force chaotic change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The day after the killings, European Union envoys put heavy pressure on Yanukovych and opposition leaders to sign a pact that would allow Yanukovych to stay in power for a few months, but call early elections and make constitutional changes that would weaken his power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pro-Russian rebel forces practice near Debaltseve, eastern Ukraine, Friday, March 13, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>It was a coup, shouted his partisans in the heavily ethnic Russian east and south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Within a few weeks, Russian troops solidified their presence on Crimea and citizens on the peninsula voted to secede in a hastily called and legally questionable referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A month later, armed separatists began seizing buildings in the mainland east, sparking a war with government troops that has killed more than 5,600 people and persists despite two internationally mediated cease-fires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>As the violence in eastern Ukraine slogs on, the question of who fired the shots a year ago has fallen into the shadows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk expressed expectations that the Interior Ministry and Prosecutor General would present a full report on their investigation by the end of the week, but by Friday afternoon there was nothing forthcoming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Three suspects, members of the Ukrainian security service, were arrested last year, but one was released on bail and disappeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>What remains are the memories of those who were on the square terrifying day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The trade union building that had been turned into an opposition encampment had been gutted by fire and the air was filled with vile smoke from piles of tires set afire to deter police.</td></tr>
