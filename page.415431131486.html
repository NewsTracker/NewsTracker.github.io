<h3>Pope Francis: Devil is punishing Mexico with violence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I think the devil is punishing Mexico with great fury," the 78-year-old Francis told Mexican television in an interview broadcast late on Thursday when discussing the disappearance and apparent massacre of 43 Mexican students last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Arguing that the devil was angry with Mexico for its Christian faith, Francis said "everyone had to put their back into resolving" the criminal malaise afflicting the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mexico, a strongly Roman Catholic nation, has been wracked by drug violence in the past decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>More than 100,000 people have died in clashes between Mexican drug gangs and their battles with security forces over the last eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Last month, a spat flared up when a private email sent by the Pope was published in which he expressed concern about the "Mexicanization" of Argentina with drug gang violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mexico quickly sent a letter of protest to the Vatican, which said it had not meant to offend the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Clearly it is a technical term. It has nothing to do with the dignity of Mexico. Like when we talk about Balkanization, neither the Serbs, nor Macedonians nor Croats get angry," Francis said, referring to his use of the word Mexicanization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The disappearance of the 43 trainee teachers in the southwestern city of Iguala in late September sparked international condemnation of the security situation in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mexico said the young men were abducted by corrupt police, handed over to a local drug gang, then incinerated, triggering President Enrique Pena Nieto's deepest political crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Francis also said in the interview he believes his pontificate will be short and that he would be ready to resign like his predecessor rather than rule for life.</td></tr>

<h3>NYC man says he, not arrested friend, aimed laser at copter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I was the one that did it," Elehecer Balaguer told a judge at a Bronx court appearance for Frank Egan, the man arrested in the case this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Balaguer said Egan had "nothing to do with it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At least for now, Egan remains charged with assault, weapon possession and directing a laser at an aircraft - a crime under a state law that took effect in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Balaguer, meanwhile, was being questioned and was taken into custody on a warrant for skipping court in an unrelated marijuana-possession case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Both are due back in court April 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>By then, it should be clearer who will be prosecuted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pilots of three passenger planes and a police helicopter told authorities they suffered eye injuries - some were treated at hospitals - and distraction from a light beam as they were flying near LaGuardia Airport from about 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Monday, according to a criminal complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Police traced it to Egan's nearby apartment and found a laser device sitting on a refrigerator, the complaint said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Police had said the 36-year-old Egan admitted using the laser Monday night, but Egan denied any involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His lawyer, Francis O'Reilly, said this week that Egan, a 36-year-old florist, was asleep when the laser incident happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He didn't do anything wrong," O'Reilly said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Balaguer, who is romantically involved with a relative of Egan's, agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Balaguer, 54, said he was toying with the laser, which he had recently bought in Florida, and hadn't meant to point it at planes.</td></tr>
