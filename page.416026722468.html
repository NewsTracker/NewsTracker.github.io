<h3>Poroshenko lifts vote objections</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The conflict between Russia-backed rebels and government troops in eastern Ukraine has claimed more than 6,000 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>When it began, protesters in the east demanded a vote on giving their regions more autonomy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Such calls were rejected by the Ukrainian government at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Mr Poroshenko has met a parliamentary commission that is drafting amendments to the country's main law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said in a televised meeting that if the commission decides a vote is necessary, he would not stand in the way of a referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I'm ready to launch a referendum on the issue of state governance if you decide it is necessary," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland was the support base for Kremlin-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in February last year after months of protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Several months into the fighting, however, pro-Russia rebels said they no longer wanted just autonomy, but rather an independent state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Poroshenko insisted that he is still opposed the idea of federalisation, which Russia has advocated, but is in favour of decentralising power to the regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He specified decision-making on security, defence and foreign policy would remain in the hands of the central government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Poroshenko also added that he still does not support making Russian a second official language and said everyone should "remember it as the Lord's Prayer: Ukrainian has been and will be our only state language".</td></tr>
