<h3>Alabama woman convicted of running granddaughter to death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"There was a verdict in the case - guilty of capital murder," said Natalie Barton, director of communications for the Etowah County Sheriff's Office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Joyce Garrard, 49, was accused of making Savannah Hardin run nonstop at her home in 2012 for lying about having eaten forbidden chocolates, a prosecutor said at her trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The girl collapsed, went into seizures and died days later in hospital from dehydration and low sodium, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Etowah County assistant district attorney Marcus Reid told the jury during opening statements that Garrard acted like Sergeant Vince Carter, the drill instructor in the TV series Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C..</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said Garrard gave different accounts about what had happened when police and paramedics arrived at the home: that the girl had fallen in the yard, that she had a seizure, or had a neurological problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Defense attorney Dani Bone argued that Hardin did not die as a result of dehydration but had retained too much water in her body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The girl suffered from unspecified medical issues that resulted in frequent visits to doctors, according to court documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Garrard lost a request to move the trial to a venue where the case is less well known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Garrard said in a conversation with the driver captured on a bus video "she's going to run till I tell her to stop," as punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hardin had a bladder condition and was not allowed to have anything containing caffeine, Garrard told the bus driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The child's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, has also been charged with murder for allegedly witnessing the punishment and failing to intervene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sentencing for Garrard is set for Monday.</td></tr>
