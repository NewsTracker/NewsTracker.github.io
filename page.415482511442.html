<h3>Fighting between militias and Libyan Islamic State branch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>After surrounding the Islamic State-controlled city of Sirte for several weeks, the militias were about 16 kilometers (10 miles) west of the center of the city on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Other militias fighting their way into Sirte from the east are only 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from the center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Tripoli government has previously denied the existence of the Islamic State affiliate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The militias backing the Tripoli government, which is not elected or internationally recognized, are also largely Islamist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The more-extremist Islamic State group has taken control of at least two cities, Sirte and Darna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An official from Battalion 166, a unit fighting in Sirte, said five of his men had been killed and more than 17 wounded over the past two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Field commander Mohammed Abdullah said that the fighting started when an Islamic State-affiliated suicide car bomber killed a solider from Battalion 166.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Abdullah said they were trying to contain the crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He called for the Islamic State affiliate to surrender their weapons and issue a statement acknowledging the legitimacy of the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said that they have information that the Islamic State affiliate has taken over a hotel, the main conference center and a prison inside Sirte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Libyan turmoil has provided fertile ground for militants allied with the Islamic State group, which is fighting in Iraq and Syria to expand its self-styled caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>These IS-affiliated militants carried out a deadly attack on a luxury hotel in Tripoli in January, and in February released a video showing them beheading 21 Egyptian Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Egyptian military launched airstrikes on Darna in retaliation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Libya has collapsed into chaos following the ouster of longtime autocrat Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Two rival governments and parliaments - each backed by different militias - rule opposite sides of the country.</td></tr>
