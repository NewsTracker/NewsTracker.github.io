<tr><td>3</td><td>Survivor Rishi Khanal, 27, is carried on a stretcher after being freed by French rescuers from the ruins of a three-story hotel in the Gangabu area of Kathmandu, Nepal, Tuesday, April 28, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - A man pulled from the rubble of a collapsed hotel by a French rescue team more than three days after the deadly Nepal earthquake says he was forced to drink his own urine to survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rishi Khanal, 27, had just finished lunch at a hotel in Kathmandu and had gone up to the second floor when everything suddenly started to move and fall apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He was struck by falling masonry and trapped with his foot crushed under rubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I had some hope but by yesterday I'd given up. My nails went all white and my lips cracked ... I was sure no one was coming for me. I was certain I was going to die," he told The Associated Press from his hospital bed on Wednesday, surrounded by his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was surrounded by dead people and a terrible smell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But he kept banging on the rubble all around him and eventually this brought a French rescue team that extracted him after an operation lasting many hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>By the time he was pulled out, he had been trapped - in what could have become his tomb - for 82 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"There was no sound going out, or coming in. I kept banging against the rubble and finally someone responded and came to help. I hadn't eaten or had anything to drink so I drank my own urine."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It was not clear if he was a hotel employee or a guest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More than 5,000 people are known to have died and over 10,000 injured in Nepal in the magnitude 7.8 earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There were also deaths in India, Tibet and Bangladesh.</td></tr>
