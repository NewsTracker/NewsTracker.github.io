<h3>Bali Nine: drug smugglers spend time with family as 72-hour clock ticks down</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are spending some of their final hours with family as the clock ticks down to their executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Bali Nine pair was told on Saturday they will be executed on Tuesday, a moment preserved by Sukumaran who signed one of three self-portraits "72 hours just started".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His mother, Raji, and siblings, Brintha and Chunthu, were among those to visit him on Sunday, making the sad journey with Chan's mother, Helen, brother, Michael, and fiancee, Feby, among other friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is unclear how many of the 10 prisoners Indonesia has readied for execution will face the firing squad; there are reports Frenchman Serge Atlaoui has been granted a reprieve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sukumaran, 34, and Chan, 31, were also asked on Saturday for their last wishes, and have been granted more time with family in their final days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lawyers are pleading with Jakarta to respect legal proceedings that several are still pursuing and international pressure for mercy has grown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>France has pledged to work with Australia to halt the executions; the prime minister, Tony Abbott, is due to meet the French president, Francois Hollande, on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hollande has warned that the execution of Atlaoui could damage relations with Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said on Saturday the government would continue to seek clemency from the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, for both men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It is not too late for a change of heart," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers have lodged a challenge with the constitutional court but the attorney-general does not acknowledge it, and says the pair have exhausted their appeals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But his office is yet to respond to moves by lawyers for a Filipina, Mary Jane Veloso, who filed a second request for a judicial review late on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Indonesian Zainal Abidin has an appeal before the courts due to be decided on Monday but has been moved in preparation for execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Atlaoui apparently won a reprieve based on an administrative matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-Moon, has added to global calls for Indonesia to halt its execution plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The secretary-general urges president Joko Widodo to urgently consider declaring a moratorium on capital punishment in Indonesia, with a view toward abolition," a spokesman for Ban said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sukumaran and Chan were ringleaders of the so-called "Bali Nine" - Australians convicted of conspiring to smuggle 8kg of heroin from the Indonesian island to Australia in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They are the only two of the group to have been sentenced to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The remaining seven were given life sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Saturday Bishop said she feared the worst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Australia has come under fire for its part in what was a joint investigation between the two countries into the drug plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Allowing the Indonesian authorities to make the arrest, instead of the Australian federal police, left the door open for the possibility of Australian citizens to face the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sukumaran's cousin Niranjela Karunatilake said: "It's a desperate time and we don't really know what else we can do to try and stop this, if there is anything left we can do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The death penalty is never the answer, but in Myu's case, when he has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short. We are not asking for Myu to be freed. All we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Widodo has resisted other pleas for clemency from France, Brazil, the Philippines and Nigeria, all of which have citizens among the condemned, and has insisted that the country will take the toughest possible line with drug offenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The acting Labor leader and opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, said: "I believe it seriously damages the ability of Indonesia to plead for its own citizens internationally when it is ignoring the pleas of countries such as Australia for the lives of our citizens."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>She said it was vital Abbott and Bishop contact their Indonesian counterparts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"It is unacceptable that while there are still legal processes under way that this sentence should be carried out," Plibersek said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>She said it was not the time to speculate on what might happen if the executions went ahead: "I think the time now is to focus on what we might do to delay the application of this sentence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Amnesty International has been campaigning for the men and is calling for a stay of execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Last week an exhibition was held in its London offices of paintings by Sukumaran, who was born in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He has become well known in Indonesia for his work helping other inmates with rehabilitation and has been praised by the prison's warden for being key to reducing drug use inside the jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In Indonesia, a prisoner has the choice of standing or sitting and whether to have their eyes covered by a blindfold or a hood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Firing squads are made up of 12 people, three of whose rifles are loaded with live ammunition, while the other nine rifles contain blanks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The squad fires from a distance of between five and 10 metres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Fionna Smyth, Amnesty UK's head of campaigns, said efforts would continue until the last possible moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Where there's life there's hope. The eyes of the world are on Indonesia," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Does it really want to be a country associated with 'execution island' rather than the exotic beaches it was once famed for?"</td></tr>
