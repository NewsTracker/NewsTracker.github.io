<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - The Mexican government says it is working with the United States in the investigation into a shooting attack on a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter on June 5, but says it "categorically rejects any attempt to see the border as a security threat."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said Thursday the U.S. border informed the Mexican government that it will send two Blackhawk helicopters to patrol the Texas border area where the helicopter was hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The apparently unarmored chopper was forced to make an emergency landing in Laredo, Texas, after bullets hit the ride side of the aircraft and the rotor blade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mexico has long opposed any militarization of the border.</td></tr>
