<h3>Greek justice pursues jobless father-of-3 beyond the grave</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) - A Greek court has convicted a dead man of stealing electricity from a power utility, giving him a six-month suspended jail sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Defense lawyer Christos Bakelas told the Thessaloniki court that his client was deceased, and asked to have the trial deferred until he could deliver a death certificate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the court refused, and on Tuesday convicted his client in absentia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Thessaloniki police records show the 46-year-old unemployed father of three died on April 8, but Bakelas wasn't informed until the eve of the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The man was charged last year after activists reconnected his power supply that had been cut by the electricity company for unpaid bills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bakelas said he was astonished by the court's decision and hadn't experienced anything like it in his 25 years as a lawyer.</td></tr>
