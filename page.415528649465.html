<h3>'Community' is back in session &#239;&#191;&#189; this time on Yahoo Screen</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Typically, it was a metaphor for the show itself, which had struggled to survive throughout the years; "Save Greendale!" was the fifth season's hashtaggy theme.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Also, the show was then on NBC, a television network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It returns to the world this week via Yahoo Screen, which is something you need the Internet to watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But unlike Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu Plus, it doesn't require a subscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>(It's free, people! Free!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apart from the venue and some changes in the cast, it is the "Community" you may know and maybe love.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>(I am ardently fond of it myself.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That the series lasted as long as it did on broadcast TV does seem something of a miracle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was the last to premiere of a Thursday night group of self-aware ensemble comedies that also included "The Office," "30 Rock" and "Parks and Recreation" that were for a time all that NBC had going for it in the way of prestige.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mostly low-rated, they shared a golden moment when the geeks and the weirdos were allowed run of the school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"A show set in a community college," to steal a description of the show from the show itself, "Community" continues to achieve a tricky balance of cynicism, sentiment and surreality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Series commander Dan Harmon, who seems from afar to present an unusual mix of dishevelment and perfectionism, and who spent the fourth season fired from his own creation, maintains a firm hand on the wheel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As before, it stars Joel McHale, Gillian Jacobs, Dani Pudi, Alison Brie, Ken Jeong and Jim Rash as a collection of geeks and weirdos allowed run of the school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gone from the cast are Yvette Nicole Brown, who played Shirley, along with last year's recurring players John Oliver and Jonathan Banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>New regulars offset the loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Keith David (lately of "Enlisted") brings back the AARP demo that Chevy Chase once represented and, ethnically speaking, redresses the loss of Brown and the earlier loss of Donald Glover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As Jeong's Ben Chang asks early in the season premiere, "Have any of you white people noticed what's happened to this group? Do Abed and I need to be concerned?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Paget Brewster plays Frankie, a financial consultant assigned by Rash's Dean to work with the other characters' study group/committee room, to their near-unanimous disapproval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At first, she seems to come from a more conventional, well-organized reality - her even-tempered effect is something new for "Community" - but we will later see that this is not exactly the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"My umbrella concern is that you as a character represent the end of what I used to call 'our show,'" Abed (Pudi) tells her cautiously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This is the first I've heard that I'm a character on a show," says Frankie - who is, of course, a character on a show - and suggests that "Good shows change, I assume - personally, I don't own a TV."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Community" is not the first show to make a point of its own artifice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But something special does happen here; the show lives in consciousness of its own construction in a kind of existential but also dramatically meaningful way.</td></tr>
