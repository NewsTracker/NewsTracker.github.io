<h3>#BringBackClarkson petition attracts hundreds of thousands of signatures</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Several hundred thousand people have signed a petition calling for the presenter of BBC show Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson, to be reinstated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The outspoken British presenter of the motoring show was suspended by the BBC yesterday after he was involved in a "fracas" with a producer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The #BringBackClarkson petition has a simple message, "Please reinstate Jeremy Clarkson to Top Gear".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Jeremy is a bastion of light in a dark [politically correct] world", one signatory's comment said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"A minority of over-sensitive people should not ruin one of Britain's favourite shows," said another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The BBC said Top Gear, which has 350 million viewers per week in 170 countries, would not be broadcast this Sunday as scheduled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The BBC has not confirmed reports Clarkson punched a producer on the show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>According to some media reports, Clarkson was angry over a catering issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The 54-year-old presenter joked with reporters as he left his home that he was on his way to the job centre and he made light of his new found freedom from the show's taping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A rival petition for the BBC to sack him gathered 12,700 supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Clarkson has got away with his bigoted rantings for far too long whilst others have been sacked for less. Why do the BBC let him get away with it?" said one signatory, Caryne Pearce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>British prime minister David Cameron, who is also Clarkson's local MP, has lent his support to the beleaguered broadcaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"What I'd say, because he is a talent and he does amuse and entertain so many people including my children, who'd be heartbroken if Top Gear is taken off air," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I hope this can be sorted out because it's a great program and he's a great talent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clarkson in February indicated he might have been unhappy with the show by tweeting: "Wanted: new presenter for Top Gear. Applicant should be old, badly dressed and pedantic but capable of getting to work on time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The BBC cancelled the broadcast of three upcoming episodes, the end of the current series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The show's executive producer Andy Wilman described 2014 as "an annus horribilis" after accusations of racism and an incident in which the show's crew were driven out of Argentina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Protests broke out there over the number plate of a Porsche, "H982 FKL", which was interpreted by some as a reference to the Falklands War between Britain and Argentina in 1982.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Clarkson was among those forced to abandon their vehicles after an angry crowd pelted them with stones, but the BBC denied the registration plate was a deliberate provocation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Most damaging for Clarkson have been accusations of racism while reciting an old nursery rhyme in leaked footage, something the presenter denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Britain's broadcasting watchdog also criticised the BBC in July after Clarkson used an "offensive racial term" in an episode on Myanmar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Top Gear had previously got into hot water over its depictions of Albanians, Romanians and Germans, and the BBC apologised to Mexico after the show described Mexicans as "lazy" and "feckless".</td></tr>

<h3>Ferguson police chief resigns</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- The police chief in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson resigned Wednesday in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report prompted by the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The city said in a statement that it reached a mutual separation agreement with Chief Thomas Jackson, who will get a severance payment and health insurance for a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Al Eickhoff will become acting chief March 19 while the city searches for a replacement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jackson had previously resisted calls by protesters and some of Missouri's top elected leaders to step down over his handling of the August shooting of Michael Brown and the weeks of sometimes-violent protests that followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Several text and phone messages left with Mayor James Knowles III and Jackson were not returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jackson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he felt it was time for the city to move on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I believe this is the appropriate thing to do at this time," Jackson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This city needs to move forward without any distractions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Jackson becomes the sixth employee to resign or be fired after the U.S. Department of Justice last week issued a report that cleared Officer Darren Wilson of civil rights charges in the shooting but found a profit-driven court system and widespread racial bias in the city police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The police chief's resignation was welcomed by state lawmakers who represent Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There would be a lot of people that would approve of that," said Democratic state Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sharon Pace, who represents the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Jackson oversaw the Ferguson force for nearly five years before the shooting that stirred months of unrest across the St. Louis region and drew global attention to the predominantly black city of 21,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>His handling of the situation drew wide criticism from the outset, both for the aggressive police response to protesters and for his agency's erratic and infrequent releases of key information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Attorney General Chris Koster and U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill were among those working behind the scenes to get him to resign, but Jackson stood firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Since the Aug. 9 shooting, he has spoken of a desire to work with community members and described efforts to bolster minority hiring in a department that had just three black officers at the time of Brown's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But he struggled to manage a local crisis that turned into an international event and explain his decision-making at news conferences disrupted by angry protesters and grieving community members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Then the Justice Department issued its report, which found that Ferguson's police and court systems functioned as a money-making enterprise rather than one meant to ensure public safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The report found black drivers in Ferguson were more than twice as likely as others to be searched during routine traffic stops and more likely to face excessive force from police, often during unwarranted stops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Investigators also noted that Ferguson was counting on revenues from fines and fees to generate nearly a quarter of its total $13.3 million budget for the 2015 fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Many residents ended up in jail after missing court dates or failing to pay fines for minor violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The report also uncovered evidence that three employees -- a court clerk and two police officers -- had sent racist emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The clerk was fired last week and two officers resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The judge who oversaw the court system also resigned and the City Council on Tuesday agreed to a separation agreement with the city manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Associated Press Writer David Lieb in Jefferson City, Mo., contributed to this report.</td></tr>
