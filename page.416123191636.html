<h3>Apple Watch on show as pre-ordering starts: live</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Visitors to Apple retail stores in the UK will be able to preview and then try on the Watch - by appointment - before pre-ordering one of the three Watch collection, that start at 299, but go up to more than 13,000 in price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The smartwatch goes on sale on April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Angela Ahrendts, Apple's head of retail and online stores said: "We are excited to welcome customers and introduce them to Apple Watch, our most personal device yet. Based on the tremendous interest from people visiting our stores, as well as the number of customers who have gone to the Apple Online Store to mark their favourite Apple Watch ahead of availability, we expect that strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"To provide the best experience and selection to as many customers as we can, we will be taking orders for Apple Watch exclusively online during the initial launch period."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This marks a noticeable change in approach from the iPhone maker, which is famous for the long queues outside its stores when new products arrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Customers will be able to order a Watch while in a store, but this will be done through an Apple store employee and via the company's internal online store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The 18-karat gold alloy Apple Watch Edition will only be available to try on in selected Apple stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This premium version of the device starts at 8,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A special Apple Watch Store is also opening within Selfridges on Oxford Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Cupertino company's first wearable device comes with a Digital Touch feature that enables users to send vibrations to other Watch wearers, as well as transmit their heartbeat to another user also via vibrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Watch also tracks movement and contains Apple's voice-based assistant, Siri, as well as Apple Pay, so it can be used to make contactless payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The new device will face stiff competition from existing and upcoming products on the market, including a premium smartwatch announced by Swiss brand Tag Heuer last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Technology rivals Samsung also already have several smartwatches on the market, and the crowd-funded Pebble Time smartwatch has recently become the heavily-backed item ever on crowd-sourcing website, Kickstarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>What is Tesla going to unveil on April 30?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>What is Apple secretly working on?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Is this what an Apple drone would look like?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Should Apple ever choose to manufacture a drone quadrocopter, a German graphic designer has a few ideas for how it should look.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Many teenagers have never seen or used a video tape or a floppy disc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Take a look at some gadgets which will puzzle younger people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Apple has unveiled the Apple Watch, and a new iPhone could be next.</td></tr>
