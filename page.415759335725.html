<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Plaintiffs in the federal class-action lawsuit brought against the NHL over concussion-related injuries want Commissioner Gary Bettman to testify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson denied the league's motion to dismiss the complaint, attorneys for the former players filed a brief Wednesday that requested Bettman's deposition by July 1 and blamed the NHL for stalling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The plaintiffs have argued the NHL had knowledge and resources to better prevent head trauma, failed to properly warn players of such risks and promoted violent play that led to their injuries.</td></tr>
