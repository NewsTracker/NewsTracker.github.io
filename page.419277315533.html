<h3>Divisions widen in Syriza ahead of bailout vote</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's ruling Syriza party is edging towards a formal split this afternoon, hours before rebel leftist politicians plan to vote against a new bailout deal to keep the country afloat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With opposition support, the government is asking parliament to approve an 85bn bailout deal that Greece needs to avoid defaulting on a debt repayment next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The vote, expected in the early hours of tomorrow, will test the strength of a rebellion by anti-austerity Syriza politicians, which could raise pressure on Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to call snap elections as early as September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The rebels' leader, former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, took a step towards breaking away from Syriza, a coalition of leftist groups which stormed to power in January promising to reverse austerity policies demanded by the eurozone and International Monetary Fund creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The fight against the new bailout starts today, by mobilising people in every corner of the country," said a statement signed by Mr Lafazanis and 11 other Syriza members posted on the far-left faction's Iskra website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The statement called for founding a "united movement that will justify people's desire for democracy and social justice" although it did not explicitly call for a new party or a split from Syriza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Parliament, however, is expected to approve the bailout agreement by a comfortable margin since opposition parties have promised their backing for the government to ensure Greece does not return to financial chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Tsipras has faced a rebellion among about a quarter of his 149 politicians since agreeing last month to the bailout deal under the threat of a banking collapse and eurozone exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He has long argued Greece cannot repay all its huge debts and demanded a partial write-off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, the creditors - the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF - have agreed to consider the issue only after a review in October of the government's implementation of its side of the deal.</td></tr>
