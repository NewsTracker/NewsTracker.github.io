<h3>Google's 'Your Timeline' maps feature tracks all your past locations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google is turning your years of location data into an automated, private diary of your life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google's 'Your Timeline' shows a map of your past trips along with step-by-step details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Many of us are now used to fact that wherever we go, assuming we've allowed it, Google is collecting and collating location data to personalise the services and ads it provides us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>From this week, you'll also be to look fondly back on all that data in the form of a chronological list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google unveiled the new feature - called "Your Timeline" - in a blog post, describing it as "a useful way to remember and view the places you've been on a given day, month or year".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Your Timeline will also be available in the Maps app on Android phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Viewable on a browser or Android phone, Your Timeline lets you choose a timeframe and see a map populated with little tags like "Sunday in Sydney" or "trip to Shanghai".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clicking one brings up a map of your movements and a full list of places visited, including shops, restaurants and train stations, plus any other snippets of data you've provided to Google through one service or another.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Of course the feature's usefulness rests entirely on whether or not you've been carrying your device with GPS and location history enabled every single day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For decent results, you'll also want to have been using Google Photos on your trips (so your geo-tagged happy snaps can appear on your timeline as well) and be visiting well-known places or shops that are listed on Google Maps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Most of my own personal timeline consists of decidedly non-nostalgic entries like a "trip to Melbourne" earlier this year which apparently consisted of my visiting seven different places called 'Melbourne VIC' at various spots around the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There's also a few instances in which I seem to have spent a "weekend in Australia" (which is technically true, but not memory-jogging), and one in which I appear to have taken a plane from Melbourne, gone directly to a 7-Eleven in western Sydney and then flown back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Entries like these point to the fact Google may still have some fine-tuning to do before Your Timeline can become a truly handy or enjoyable feature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If you're a frequent user of Google's location services the timeline will benefit from information on where you work and live, which makes the whole thing a bit more readable, and if you're so inclined you can click on any location and name it - parents' house, local pub etc - so it will be listed as such each time you visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Other customisation options include the ability to wipe any locations or an entire day from your history altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>For example I could dip into the records from my "quick trip to Osaka" and remove all the seedier entries or make it appear as though I never left the hotel, which is pretty weird given how adamant Google is that the user and only the user has access to this data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>You're only lying to yourself, guys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On the other hand you can also add new entries that the data collection didn't pick up, to flesh out your records or to fool Google into thinking you're more interesting than you appear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The feature is somewhat reminiscent of the TimeHop app, or Facebook's own "On This Day" feature, which both appeal to our sense of nostalgia by showing us status updates and interactions from our past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Google's take is a lot more granular and complete, but it also (rightly) lacks the ease and shareability of those other experiences, making its purpose - beyond encouraging you to feed in yet more tasty details about your life - a little unclear in its current form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Maybe, for a truly frightening and engrossing experience, a future update could also give us a chronological list of Google search queries we made on any given day.</td></tr>
