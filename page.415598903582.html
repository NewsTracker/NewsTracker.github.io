<tr><td>2</td><td>"We were terrified when we started hearing gunshots echoing ... but everywhere became calm about an hour later. The soldiers informed us that it was the Boko Haram terrorists that came back", said Aji Kaumi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He and Mohammed Umara said 11 civilians were killed on the outskirts of Gamboru.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>France brought about the regional cooperation with a summit in Paris last year that eased strained relations between Nigeria and its smaller, francophone neighbors amid growing concern as Boko Haram began launching attacks across Nigeria's borders.</td></tr>
