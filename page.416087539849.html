<h3>Apple's iOS 8.3 update includes 'more diverse' emoji</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple has released its latest software update for iPhone users which includes a more diverse set of emoji.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The update, which has been in beta for several months, brings over 300 new emojis (including diversity options) as well as a new keyboard for inputting them more easily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The new keyboard features a scrolling system to allow users to see the new range more easily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In an effort to better represent society, Apple has revealed a new set of globally diverse emoji that come in six different skin tones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Japanese electronic messages and webpages, whose use is spreading outside Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means "picture" (e) + "letter" (moji).</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Icons are standardised, and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese curry, and sushi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could noww be added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The update also includes dozens of other updates, including an update to the iCloud Photo Library has been optimized to work with the new Photos app on OS X 10.10.3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It also includes new languages for Siri, improved performance and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth fixes, orientation and rotation fixes, and others fixes in Messages, Family Sharing, CarPlay, Enterprise and Accessibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple has also released the final version of OS X 10.10.3, the latest major update for OS X Yosemite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It includes the new Photos app, an OS X version of the photo viewing and editing app included with iOS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It is a replacement for iPhoto, the basic photo app included with the iLife suite for years before becoming available for free for all new Macs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The new emoji tones include an option that turns a character yellow - a shade that the Cupertino-based company says it intended to be ethnically neutral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the colour has angered some Apple users, particularly those in China, who claim that the yellow tone is offensive to Asians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Another user, Taylor Wofford, tweeted: 'It look like it has colic.'The move could damage Apple's reputation in one of its leading markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The group doubled its sales in China last year, while Samsung has been losing market share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Last year, Apple revealed it was working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Because emoji have to be displayed on different devices, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The disclosure came after Apple boss Tim Cook was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A set of new emoji characters will also be unveiled, including racially diverse families and same-sex families, according to The Next Web.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Santa now comes in six skin tones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Apple's Katie Cotton, who was the head of communications at the firm at the time, replied, telling MTV: 'Tim forwarded your email to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>We agree with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'Our emoji characters are based on the Unicode standard, which is necessary for them to be displayed properly across many platforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to DoSomething.org calling on Apple to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>'Of the more than 800 Emoji, the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a turban,' it says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to Apple's keyboard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same-sex couple, and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones.</td></tr>
