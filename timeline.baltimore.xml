    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;BALTIMORE - Less than three years ago, Anthony Batts was hand-picked by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to combat crime and reform a troubled law enforcement department in one of America's most violent cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batts and Rawlings-Blake are African-American, as is the city's top prosecutor, Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baltimore's homicide total this year is 156, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The startling spike stands in stark contrast to Batts' promise to fight violent crime when he arrived in Baltimore in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batts took over from Fred Bealefeld, who resigned after five years as commissioner and 31 in the Baltimore Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batts too was a veteran officer, though new to the city of Baltimore: He spent three decades in California, two as commissioner of the embattled Oakland Police Department and seven as commissioner of the Long Beach police department, where he'd served as a law enforcement officer for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I worked closely with Commissioner Batts and always found him open to my ideas for reforming the department," said Baltimore City Council President Bernard C. "Jack" Young.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
