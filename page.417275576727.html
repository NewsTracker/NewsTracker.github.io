<h3>Pension adviser says Ernst & Young was aware of Wal-Mart Mexico bribery allegations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - A labor-affiliated pension fund adviser is seeking an inquest into the auditor of Wal Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Ernst & Young LLP, accusing the auditing firm of knowing about possible bribery in Mexico long before the retailer disclosed it to U.S. authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CtW Investment Group, an adviser to union pension funds holding about 0.15 percent of Wal-Mart's shares, said an internal Wal-Mart memo released during shareholder litigation showed that Ernst & Young was informed by Wal-Mart's internal audit services, or IAS, unit that a whistleblower had provided evidence of the alleged Mexico bribery scheme to Wal-Mart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"E&Y was briefed by IAS over the course of the Company's internal investigation from late 2005 through early 2006," according to a letter sent last week by CtW to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The board, CtW wrote, should consider "whether E&Y responded appropriately after obtaining evidence of illegal acts and serious internal control deficiencies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>CtW Executive Director Dieter Waizenegger said the group only realized the significance of the memo in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In 2014, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed a lower court ruling that ordered Wal-Mart to provide a shareholder with documents related to the company's internal probe of allegations the retailer had paid bribes in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The alleged bribes and cover-up came to light with a New York Times story in 2012 that reported the company's Mexican unit had been making illicit payments since 2005 to obtain permits needed to open stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The story said Wal-Mart's investigators found evidence of widespread payments and suspected that laws had been broken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The story also said Wal-Mart leaders rejected an investigator's recommendation to expand the probe and instead covered it up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Wal-Mart is currently under investigation by U.S. authorities who are trying to determine if crimes were committed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to comment further on specific allegations, or for us or others to come to specific conclusions until it is finished," Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said in an emailed statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A representative for PCAOB declined to comment, and Ernst & Young was not immediately available for comment.</td></tr>
