<h3>Chadian troops seize Nigerian town of Dikwa from Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chad has deployed thousands of soldiers in strategic positions around Lake Chad in an effort to contain the radical jihadist group within Nigeria, sometimes chasing them across the border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Its efforts have intensified since Boko Haram attacked the Chadian village of Ngouboua last month, killing several people in the first known lethal attack in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have total control of the town," said Colonel Azem Bermandoua.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He added that many Boko Haram fighters had also been killed in the clashes on Monday in northeastern Nigeria, the Islamist group's stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A Reuters reporter on the scene said black and white Boko Haram flags still flew in a town deserted of residents after several weeks of occupation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a separate incident, Niger, whose army is also fighting the militants, said it had killed six Boko Haram fighters on Saturday near the village of Bossi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two of their vehicles were then destroyed by Chad's air forces, the army said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Boko Haram has killed thousands of people and kidnapped hundreds in its attempt to create an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria, although the tide appears to be turning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nigeria's army has won significant battles against them in recent weeks, raising hopes that the country's delayed presidential election will go ahead peacefully on March 28.</td></tr>
