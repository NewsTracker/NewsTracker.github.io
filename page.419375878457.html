<h3>Greek government seen calling confidence vote</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Greek flag flutters in front of a crowded beach at a suburb of Athens, Greece, Saturday, Aug. 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Finance ministers of the 19-nation euro single currency group on Friday approved the first 26 billion euros ($29 billion) of a vast new bailout package to help rebuild Greece's shattered economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A European Union (EU) flag flutters in front of the temple of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece, Saturday, Aug. 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to call a confidence vote in his government after the country's third bailout deal with international creditors sparked a rebellion within his party, one of his ministers indicated Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Expectations of a confidence vote, which could lead to early elections, heightened after last Friday's parliamentary vote in favor of the 86 billion euro three-year ($93 billion) bailout passed thanks to opposition support and saw dozens of lawmakers in Tsipras' Syriza party dissent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Without the bailout, Greece faces defaulting on its debts and eventually being forced out of Europe's joint currency, the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I consider it self-evident, after the deep wounding of the parliamentary majority and in particular of the parliamentary group of Syriza, for there to be a move that at least approaches the issue," Energy and Environment Minister Panos Skourletis told Skai television when asked about the possibility of the government calling a confidence vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Skourletis added that early elections may also be necessary in light of the political instability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The government has said its priority is currently securing the bailout funding, which it needs by Thursday to meet a large debt repayment to the European Central Bank, and that any further decisions on the political situation will be taken from then on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In order to secure the bailout deal, Tsipras reneged on the promises that saw his radical left Syriza party win January elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Syriza's coalition government with the small nationalist Independent Greeks was premised on a pledge to repeal austerity measures tied to Greece's two previous international bailouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Instead, after months of floundering negotiations with international creditors, the government accepted demands for steep tax hikes and deep spending cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The about-face has angered an increasing number of Syriza lawmakers, including prominent members such as former ministers of finance Yanis Varoufakis, and energy Panagiotis Lafazanis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Both voted against the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Last week Lafazanis - who was replaced as minister in a reshuffle last month after opposing the government in a previous bailout-related vote - and another 12 left-wing politicians announced they were creating a new anti-austerity movement, although Lafazanis stopped short of quitting the party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If a confidence vote is called, a parliamentary debate would start two days later, with a vote held after a maximum three-day discussion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tsipras will need the support of a majority of lawmakers present in the 300-member parliament - and not less than 120 - for his government to survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Opposition parties have indicated they will not back Tsipras in a confidence vote, so the outcome will depend on Syriza dissenters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>If many vote against, they will bring down the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>However, if they chose not to be present, Tsipras would need fewer votes and could survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The turmoil has raised the possibility of general elections being called as soon as next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Asked about the possibility, Skourletis said he believed such a move was necessary in order to tackle the political instability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He noted that the bailout meant the situation had now changed compared to when Syriza initially won its popular mandate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I would say the elections are necessary," Skourletis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Because given the problems in the governing majority, today's situation can be described as anything but stable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"If we don't see it in the foreseeable future, then instability will be what determines developments," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Elections would be held three to four weeks after being declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Despite his U-turn, Tsipras has remained popular and is believed to be well-placed to win a forthcoming election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Although no opinion polls have been published since the end of last week when Greece's third bailout was finalized, previous polls showed his party enjoying a wide lead over opposition parties.</td></tr>
