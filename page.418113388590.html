<h3>Cheers, relief and tears for HHS chief after high court ends Obamacare fight</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell saw on her office computer that the Supreme Court was about to release the much-anticipated ruling on the Affordable Care Act, she rushed out of her office and down the hall to a conference room where about two dozen senior staff were gathered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Before she got there, she heard a cheer erupt from the room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"And that's the moment that I knew," said Burwell, describing how she found out Thursday that the court had upheld a key part of the Affordable Care Act, allowing health insurance subsidies to flow to all qualifying Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Burwell also knew that the initial media reports could be wrong, recalling what happened the last time the court ruled on a challenge to the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Are we sure?" she asked her staff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She also took a moment to lean over a staff member's shoulder to read the decision on a laptop as staff members double-checked the opinion, according to an official in the room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The mood in the room was joyful but also relieved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some staff members cried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Only then did the top health care official allow herself to become emotional and cry, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In a meeting with reporters Friday, Burwell said the day of the ruling was "very emotional."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But now it's time to focus on what's next, and said she planned to spend her remaining time in office on many of the other aspects of the health law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I believe it's time to turn and build on the progress," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Repeating a theme she has stressed in recent weeks, Burwell said she would work harder to help Americans understand the law's many other provisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Although the law - and the word "Obamacare" - are unpopular, many provisions of the law are popular.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Obamacare isn't connected to the actual substance" of the law, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's about your child of 26 being able to stay on (parents' health plan), it is about you no longer having to worry about pre-existing conditions, it is about you can use preventive services often without a co-pay," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Burwell said she would also make a renewed push for states to expand Medicaid, the state-federal health program for the poor, and changing the way government pays for health care by linking payments more closely to the quality of care rather than the quantity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Asked whether health officials had any new strategy to persuade states to broaden Medicaid coverage, Burwell said: "I'm an optimist about the Medicaid issue in terms of being able to make some progress."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She said she would continue to reach out and work with governors to come to understandings that suit each state's circumstances, citing recent agreements reached in Indiana and Florida.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We welcome the opportunity to talk about how a particular state needs to do this. |We think there's a lot of space to get to agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The law originally expanded Medicaid to include all childless low-income adults earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (about $16,250 for an individual).</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could choose that option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Twenty-one states have resisted, most of them led by Republican governors.</td></tr>
