<h3>Shares Languish as Weak China CPI, Greece Darken Outlook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Shares were mostly lower on Tuesday as weak Chinese economic data added to the gloom over Wall Street's losses and deadlocked Greek bailout negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>KEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX fell 0.3 percent to 11,037.50 and France's CAC 40 lost 0.2 percent to 4,846.90.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Britain's FTSE 100 drifted in and out of negative territory and was nearly flat at 6,790.51.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Wall Street looked ready for a bounce-back, with both Dow and S&P 500 futures up 0.1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>CHINA FACTOR: China's inflation benchmark slipped to 1.2 percent in May from 1.5 percent the month before, signaling weak demand and continued deflationary pressures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That followed Monday's report that both imports and exports contracted again in May. The string of lackluster data is adding to pressures for further stimulus to prevent the slowdown becoming a sharp slump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>GREEK DEBT: Talks between Greece and its creditors have been deadlocked since Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rejected a proposal last week made by the three institutions overseeing the country's bailout: the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An agreement is needed by June 30, when Greece's emergency financing program ends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>ANALYST'S VIEW: "If central banks are waiting for the smaller pieces of the economic jigsaw to fall into place, then investors are likely to sit on their hands for now as well, waiting for news of central bank action or economic growth that encourages earnings estimate increases," Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG, said in a commentary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>ASIA'S DAY: Japan's Nikkei 225 sagged 1.8 percent to 20,096.30 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.1 percent to 27,028.69.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Shanghai Composite shed 0.4 percent to 5,113.53 and South Korea's Kospi edged 0.1 percent lower to 2,064.03.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.5 percent to 5,471.30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Shares in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also were lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 17 cents to $58.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It fell 99 cents Monday to close at $58.14 a barrel in New York after import data suggested a slowdown in Chinese trade, which could lead to weaker global demand for diesel, gasoline and other fuels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, rose 53 cents to $63.76 a barrel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It fell 62 cents to close at $62.69 in London on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>CURRENCIES: The U.S. dollar slipped to 124.43 yen from 124.62 yen on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The euro climbed to $1.1294 from $1.1278.</td></tr>
