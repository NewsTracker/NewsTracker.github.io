<h3>Congress considering repeal of meat labeling law in face of retaliation from Canada and Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Meat labels are seen at a grocery store in Washington, Tuesday, May 19, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are hoping to repeal a law requiring country-of-origin labels on packages of meat to avoid costly trade retaliation from Canada and Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The World Trade Organization ruled against the law last month, saying the labels that say where animals were born, raised and slaughtered are discriminatory toward the two U.S. border countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Canada and Mexico have said they will now ask the WTO for permission to raise tariffs on U.S. goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The House on Wednesday began debate on legislation that would repeal the law for beef, pork and poultry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A vote was expected later in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Congress required the labels in 2008, mostly at the behest of the northern U.S. ranchers who compete with the Canadian cattle industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Consumer advocates also have supported the labels.</td></tr>
