<h3>Julie Bishop to push for MH17 tribunal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop will push for the United Nations Security Council to establish an international criminal tribunal on the downing of flight MH17 12 months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Australia and the four other members of the joint investigation team - Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine - are in New York to argue the case for a tribunal to investigate the downing of the Malaysia Airlines plane and the prosecution of those responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the push faces a resolute Russia, which is expected to veto the proposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The flight was downed on July 17 last year over rebel-held east Ukraine, during heavy fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>All 298 people, including 39 from Australia, onboard the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Malaysia has circulated a draft resolution requiring all countries to co-operate with the special tribunal or face sanctions, and called for a vote on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russia has objected to the tribunal and has asked instead for the conclusions of an investigation into the disaster, which are expected in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ms Bishop said the MH17 disaster had "far-reaching implications" for the safety and security of all air travellers.</td></tr>
