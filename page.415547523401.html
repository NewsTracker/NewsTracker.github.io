<h3>Fin24.com | Facebook rolling out payments to friends feature</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington - Facebook announced on Tuesday that it is launching a system to send money to friends for US customers using its Messenger mobile app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The free service will be offered "in the coming months", according to a Facebook statement, and will put the huge social network in competition with services such as Square Cash and Venmo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The money transfer will use bank debit cards of members for a quick cash transfer, which may take up to three days depending on the banks used, Facebook said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Facebook already handles a considerable amount of payments through its platform for advertisers and for games on its network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Facebook processes more than one million transactions daily on the site and also handles all the payments processed on Messenger," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We use secure systems that encrypt the connection between you and Facebook as well as your card information when you ask us to store it for you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was not immediately clear if Facebook would be able to generate revenue from peer-to-peer money transfers, but the feature could be the start of a more extensive payment network which could be profitable.</td></tr>
