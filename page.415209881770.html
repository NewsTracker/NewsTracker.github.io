<h3>Private email questions emerge as Clinton nears 2016 bid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Congressional aides say the special House committee investigating the 2012 attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, will issue subpoenas for Clinton's personal emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The aides say that possible as early as Wednesday, the committee will seek the additional material from the potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FILE - In this Oct. 18, 2011, file photo, then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton checks her Blackberry from a desk inside a C-17 military plane upon her departure from Malta, in the Mediterranean Sea, bound for Tripoli, Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clinton used a personal email account during her time as secretary of state, rather than a government-issued email address, potentially hampering efforts to archive official government documents required by law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton's office said nothing was illegal or improper about her use of the non-government account and that she believed her business emails to State Department and other .gov accounts would be archived in accordance with government rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Republicans are signaling that questions about Hillary Rodham Clinton's use of a private email account while she was secretary of state will follow her into her widely anticipated presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>GOP leaders, who control the investigative powers of Congress, say the revelations reaffirm a long-held GOP portrayal of Bill and Hillary Clinton as secretive and playing by their own rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Democrats dismiss the accusations as trivial and question whether the emails will resonate with voters in an election 20 months away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But as the presidential nominating season begins, Clinton's use of a personal email account for State Department business has stoked questions about transparency that threaten to cloud her early steps as the Democratic Party's overwhelming favorite White House prospect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The American people deserve all of the facts," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was responding to an Associated Press report that the computer server that sent and received the secretary of state's emails - on a private account used for official business - was registered to Clinton's New York home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, intends to investigate whether Clinton, by using a personal email account, may have violated federal requirements that written communications of officials are preserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The committee will join with a special committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Benghazi committee first discovered Clinton's use of a private email address and issued subpoenas Wednesday for Clinton's emails when she was secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Late Wednesday, Clinton tweeted: "I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In response, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the department will review for release the emails Clinton provided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We will undertake this review as quickly as possible; given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete," Harf said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The fresh inquiries create a distraction as she prepares to embark on a second presidential campaign amid a thin bench of potential Democratic challengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The questions follow recent reports about the Clinton family foundation's raising of money from foreign governments, while she was the country's top diplomat, to benefit the nonprofit's philanthropic mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Democrats say the latest probes are throwbacks to the 1990s when they say Republicans overplayed their hands pursuing President Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"This is part of what will be the onslaught of attacks that are just getting starting," said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It will be attack, attack, attack."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Clinton family is no stranger to controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Bill Clinton's personal and business dealings created a constant swirl of investigations, leading to his 1998 impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Hillary Clinton, as the first lady, was pressed by Republicans in the Whitewater probe of the couple's real estate investments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Clinton's team this week said she acted no differently from her predecessors at the State Department who also used private email addresses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>She used a BlackBerry before leading the department and continued to use it after she took the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The former secretary of state's team turned over 55,000 pages of emails from her time at the State Department but had discretion over what was included.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>If she emailed someone among the 100 State Department officials with whom she frequently corresponded, they said, it would have been on State Department servers, and Clinton's office replicated that to ensure it was included in the records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"I think this is mostly right-wing noise," Howard Dean, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said by email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Republicans in the possible 2016 mix have kept relatively quiet on Clinton's latest challenge to avoid bringing up transparency issues of their own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Email communication from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, has been the subject of criminal investigations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., warned of national security considerations, telling reporters Wednesday that even government emails are vulnerable and presidential campaigns are typically targeted by hackers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"You shouldn't put anything in an email that you don't think is going to be read by a foreign intelligence agency. Especially if you're the president of the United States, or a candidate for it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The email dispute may also fall into a "what goes around, comes around" category of presidential politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In 2012, Democrats spent several weeks blasting Republican Mitt Romney's refusal to release his personal tax records, accusing him of trying to obscure details of his investments and vast wealth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"What is Mitt Romney hiding?" was a frequent refrain from the Obama campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>This time, Clinton is the one accused of a lack of transparency.</td></tr>

<h3>Man with a history of criminal behaviour and mental health issues could have strangled or suffocated his grandson as he slept before shooting dead his pregnant daughter in the bathroom?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Derek John Sharpley, 52, was found dead of gunshot wounds to the head in the same room that his grandson Jackson's body was found tucked into a bed at his Biddeston property, west of Brisbane in Queensland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His 27-year-old daughter Kris-Deann Sharpley, who had moved to the Queensland town in 2011 to care for him following her mother's death, also died of gunshot wounds to the head and was found in the bathroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Detective Inspector David Isherwood would not confirm the details of Mr Sharpley's criminal history, but told Daily Mail Australia that there had been no recent incidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'They [the family] are known to police and in regard to criminal history; the reality is that while he has a criminal history, it's not recent history,' Inspector Isherwood said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Sharpley is believed to have attempted suicide in the past and had a history of substance abuse, according to The Courier Mail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Police have stopped short of dubbing the incident a murder-suicide, but have said it is unlikely another party was involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' Inspector Isherwood said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Sharpley is believed to have shot himself after killing his daughter and grandson, however detectives have been unable to determine the young boy's cause of death after preliminary pathology results returned inconclusive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Inspector Isherwood said there were no signs of physical injury on the child's body and that police were awaiting further results before making any conclusions about how he died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'There are a couple of issues, they [forensic pathologists] think, with the decomposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>You'd think that with strangulation there would be lesion marks on the neck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>What often happens in a lot of bodies in that case is that the head is tilted forward and you get bruising in the front of the body,' Inspector Isherwood said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The owner of the high-calibre gun used to kill both adults, which was found lying on a bed, has also been an unclear aspect of the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Inspector Isherwood told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Sharpley 'was not the owner of a registered firearm', but would not release any other information about the gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said detectives would return to the address on Thursday to obtain any more evidence that could be relevant to the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It comes after revelations that Kris-Deann was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl who she'd chosen to name Amber Elizabeth Rose after her late mother when she was slain, her sister-in-law Sara Turnball told the Courier Mail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann's sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tara, who is also pregnant, was accompanied by her boyfriend Allan Brown and had to climb through a window to gain access to the house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The scene at Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road home was so grisly it distressed first-response police officers, according to Detective Inspector David Isherwood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'Two of the victims, both the adult male and female, had very serious wounds to their bodies,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'There is no evidence that the house has been broken into when the police arrived they had to force entry into the premises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It would appear that the house was secure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'Police attended a Biddeston Southbrook Road address around 6.50pm after the bodies of a man, woman and boy were located.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The three aged 52, 27 and 7 respectively, were all known to each other,' Queensland Police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The shooting happened on the corner of Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road and Biddeston-Southbrook Road at Biddeston - more than 150 kilometres west of Brisbane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>'There are no concerns for public safety,' a police spokesman said.</td></tr>
