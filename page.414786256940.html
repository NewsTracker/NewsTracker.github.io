<h3>Thousands attend anti-austerity march in Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>About 18,000 people have gathered in central Athens to support the newly elected government's push for a better deal on Greece's debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Participants at Sunday's rally outside the parliament in the Greek capital carried banners denouncing economic austerity and Greece's creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We want justice here and now... for all the suffering Greece has gone through the past five years," 58-year-old Theodora, who has been unemployed for the last three years, told the AFP news agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A protester wearing a mask of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and wielding a large plastic needle with "austerity" daubed on it jousted with a fake Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras armed with a huge pair of red scissors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I'm not afraid of anything, whatever bad was going to happen has already happened," 62-year-old pensioner Vimitra told AFP, referring to five years of severe austerity in the debt-laden country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>About 8,000 people also thronged the streets in Thessaloniki, Greece's second biggest city in the north of the country, calling on Brussels to loosen the noose of austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Similar rallies were also seen in several Greek cities and about 40 other solidarity gatherings were staged across Europe and in Australia, Brazil and the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Paris, about 2,000 people walked through the city centre in a show of solidarity with Greece against what organisers called "the Goliath of finance".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Marchers unfurled flags from the far-left Syriza party of their new prime minister and chanted: "In Greece, in France, resistance against austerity and finance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In Lisbon, about 300 people took to the streets with banners reading "Greece, Spain, Portugal, our battle is international."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We want to express our solidarity with the Greek people to defend their right to decide their own future," said Paulo Coimbra, a 46-year old economist and one of the organisers of the march.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We contest austerity in Portugal as well, it's time to say 'enough' to the grip financial power has on political power," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Greek government enthusiastically welcomed these rallies while insisting that they were spontaneous affairs, organised through social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The pro-government rallies came a day before a gathering of eurozone finance ministers who will consider Greece's proposal for short-term "bridge financing" without the onerous terms previously imposed on the country, until a longer-term solution to Greece's crushing debt is found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>So-called technical level talks with creditor representatives ended on Saturday, Greek officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Greece is hoping to renegotiate its 240bn euro ($274bn) bailout, but its overtures to its international creditors have so far fallen on deaf ears, with Germany unwilling to reverse its policy on austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Athens risks being forced out of the eurozone if a deal is not found by the end of the month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Syriza party has backed down a bit but remains determined to lift Greeks out of austerity-related poverty and anguish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Can Greece lead the collapse of the euro black hole?</td></tr>
