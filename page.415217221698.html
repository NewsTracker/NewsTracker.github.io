<h3>After lifting Ebola ban, North Korea now says foreigners welcome to run in Pyongyang marathon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Even though no cases of Ebola had been reported anywhere near North Korea, the country shut out foreign tourists in October with some of the strictest Ebola regulations in the world, including saying that only local runners would be allowed into the marathon in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Uri Tours, one company that takes tourists into North Korea, said on its website Thursday that it had been informed that North Korean authorities had "decided to re-open the doors to foreign amateur runners for the 2015 Pyongyang Marathon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Earlier this week North Korea lifted its restrictions on travelers that virtually closed its borders to foreigners last October, halting all non-essential visas and requiring those few foreigners allowed in to undergo three weeks of quarantine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The rules applied to diplomats, NGO workers and even senior North Korean officials returning from overseas trips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Uri Tours statement said that registration for the April 12 race had been extended to March 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last year's race through the streets of Pyongyang, including a 10-kilometer (6-mile) competition and a half marathon along with the full course, was opened up to foreign recreational runners for the first time and was a big success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Elite runners from around the world are usually brought in for the main event, but it was not immediately known if there is enough time to arrange that this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Known officially as the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, the race is sanctioned as a bronze-label event by the International Association of Athletics Federations and has been held annually for 27 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is held in conjunction with a series of sporting competitions, arts festivals and cultural events marking the birthday of North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung, on April 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>North Korea has made a concerted effort to bolster its tourist trade in recent years by setting up special tourism zones and developing scenic areas and recreational facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tens of thousands of Chinese tourists visit each year, according to Koryo Tours, another company running trips into North Korea, while tourists from other countries are rarer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>North Korean media have suggested Ebola was created by the U.S. military as a biological weapon.</td></tr>

<h3>Mann says Storm have plenty of strikepower</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Fijian flyer left Melbourne for Canberra, but the Storm are confident they still have the flash and dash in their outside backs to cover his absence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mann beat some stiff opposition, including the powerful Mahe Fonua, to win a start in the centres in the Storm's NRL opening round clash with St George Illawarra at Jubilee Oval on Monday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I couldn't wait to get back in," Mann, 22, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I finished on a disappointing note last year because I didn't play the last eight games or so, so I'm excited to be back in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Queenslander has an impressive conversion rate, scoring six times from his eight games since making his first grade debut in round nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mann, who added four kilos to his wiry frame in the off-season, said the Storm had plenty of other strike-power as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I think Young Tonumaipea, who has taken Sisa's spot, is quite capable of doing everything that Sisa did," Mann said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He's young, talented and a really good player so he's quite capable of filling Sisa's shoes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mann is a converted centre, playing most of his junior football at fullback, in the halves and even hooker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said that the Storm's Queensland Origin centre Will Chambers had taken him under his wing.</td></tr>
