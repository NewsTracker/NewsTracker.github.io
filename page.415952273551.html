<h3>Nuclear deal threatens Israel's existence, Benjamin Netanyahu says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon (C) with binoculars on the Golan Heights as he attends an army exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ya'alon has recently spoken out about the 'bad deal' the Americans and others who have been negotiating with Iran over their capabilities to produce nuclear weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Benjamin Netanyahu has denounced the framework agreement over Iran&#x2019;s nuclear programme as a &#x201c;bad and dangerous deal&#x201d; that threatens Israel&#x2019;s existence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Netanyahu told the US leader that he &#x201c;vehemently opposed&#x201d; the agreement, saying it posed a &#x201c;grave danger to Israel, the region and the world&#x201d;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A statement issued by the prime minister&#x2019;s office afterwards was even more scathing, calling it a deal that &#x201c;kowtows to Iranian dictates&#x201d; and would pave the way to a &#x201c;military nuclear programme&#x201d;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>&#x201c;This is a bad framework that will lead to a bad and dangerous deal,&#x201d; the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>&#x201c;If an agreement is reached based on the guidelines of this framework that would be a historic mistake which will transform the world into a much more dangerous place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Netanyahu convened his security cabinet on Friday to discuss the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His negative response had been widely predicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As negotiations unfolded in Lausanne, the Israeli prime minister had compared the event to the infamous 1938 Munich conference at which the Western allies colluded with Adolf Hitler to dismember Czechoslovakia in an effort to avert war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He also pointed to a quote attributed to an Iranian general who was reported to have said this week that Israel&#x2019;s destruction was non-negotiable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>&#x201c;An Iranian official said that Israel&#x2019;s destruction is non-negotiable,&#x201d; Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While Mr Netanyahu&#x2019;s strident approach has put him in the forefront of Israeli opposition to attempts at negotiating a deal, his stance on a nuclear-armed Iran reflects a broad consensus of Israel&#x2019;s political spectrum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, joint founders of the centre-Left Zionist Union opposition, reacted to Thursday&#x2019;s agreement by calling for close cooperation with America to &#x201c;roll back Iran&#x2019;s nuclear programme and prevent it from getting nuclear weapons&#x201d;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party who was sacked last year as finance minister by Mr Netanyahu, said domestic political differences were set aside when it came to Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>&#x201c;On the Iranian nuclear issue there is no opposition and coalition,&#x201d; he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nahaum Barnea, one of Israel&#x2019;s most experienced commentators, suggested Mr Netanyahu&#x2019;s efforts to pressure Mr Obama over Iran &#x2013; which reached a peak when he addressed the US congress last month in a clear affront to the US president &#x2013; meant that the Lausanne deal amounted to a personal defeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>&#x201c;The truth should be told: this was a resounding failure for Israel,&#x201d; Mr Barnea wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth.</td></tr>
