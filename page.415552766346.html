<h3>Iran dismisses Netanyahu win, says nothing will change</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iran dismissed Wednesday Benjamin Netanyahu's election victory, saying it would have no effect on Palestinians or the Islamic world as all Israeli political parties are "the same to us".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"For us, none of the parties or political groups of the Zionist regime are any different," said foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"They all have an aggressive nature and all are the same to us and partners in atrocities against Palestinians, in plotting against Muslim nations and neglecting their rights."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu swept to a stunning triumph, securing a third straight term despite a tenure of deepening tensions with the Palestinians and shaky relations with US President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earlier this month, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Israel posed the "greatest danger" in the region, after Netanyahu made a speech to the US Congress arguing against a nuclear deal with Tehran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Netanyahu said the agreement Obama wanted with Tehran "is so bad... it paves Iran's path to the bomb" and "would spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Iran denies seeking atomic weapons and insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful energy production only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Iran and the P5+1 group -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States plus Germany -- are in negotiations to end the crisis over Tehran's disputed nuclear activities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The two sides agreed in November to reach a political agreement by March 31 and a final deal by the end of June.</td></tr>
