<h3>The shellfish giant: 'The Lobster' makes a big Cannes splash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Yorgos Lanthimos has people in Cannes imagining themselves as animals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Greek director has set the Croisette abuzz with his film "The Lobster," which puts Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz in a couples-dominated world where single people are given 45 days to find a mate, or be turned into the animal of their choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Farrell's sad-sack central character chooses a lobster, in part because the crustaceans mate for life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lanthimos' deadpan satirical surrealism has sparked anthropomorphic musing up and down the Croisette.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A dog?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A cat?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>What beast is best?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I'd be a bird," Lanthimos said in response to the inevitable question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I dream a lot about flying."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Lanthimos can plan to do a lot more flying as a rising star on the international cinema circuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The Lobster" has been gobbled up by Cannes critics and audiences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Farrell - unrecognizable behind glasses, moustache and unflattering paunch - is considered a contender for the festival's best-actor prize when awards are announced May 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The film's absurd, disturbing world and deadpan tone will be no surprise to fans of Lanthimos, who made the Oscar-nominated reality-show dystopia "Dogtooth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Lobster" is set in a strange but fully realized world, just far enough away from reality to make viewers question the social rules we accept as normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Lanthimos thinks reality is an overrated quality in movies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I don't find that interesting to do as a film, just to represent real life," he told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"There is no realism in film anyway. Even if it is pretend realism, it is still pretend."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The Lobster" is the first film Lanthimos has made outside Greece, and his first in English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It was shot in Ireland with an international cast that includes Ben Whishaw, Lea Seydoux and John C. Reilly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Farrell told reporters at a press conference that the screenplay "was by far the most unique and particular script that I had ever read. I didn't understand it either, and I'm not sure that I still do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The script may be elusive, but Lanthimos said all the cast members instinctively understood where he was coming from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"They all got it immediately," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"They held it together, and it helped a lot. Because even if I'd had the slightest problem with the cast and at the same time I had to cope with making a film in a different country (where) it's a very different experience and a different way of making films - I'm not sure if I would have gotten through it if I didn't have such absolute support from them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The Lobster" is the most expensive film Lanthimos has made, and should guarantee his next budget is bigger still.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>For the director, now based in Britain, that prospect is both frustrating and exciting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The films that I made in Greece were extremely small films made with five friends," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"It's a very different way of working when you enter a film-industry environment and there are very strict rules. People don't feel comfortable breaking those rules and people are not maybe equally passionate as your friends."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>On the positive side, "you have a proper structure and people are very professional and they know what they're doing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"You have a little bit more financing, you're certain you're going to be able to finish the film," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In Greece - still coping with severe financial crisis - "you don't even know if you're going to be able to take your film to a festival, because you barely have enough money to produce the film."</td></tr>
