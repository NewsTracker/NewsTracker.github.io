<h3>Joshua Reynolds: Experiments in Paint exhibition shows the English portraitist was a great innovator</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But like his pictures, his reputation occasionally crumbles, for his gambles with new techniques did not always pay off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Notably, his inclusion of volatile, gluey bitumen, and his early habit of combining colours in an act of mutually assured destruction meant that some canvases deteriorated quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Indeed, one disgruntled subject, Sir Walter Blackett, seeing his portrait disintegrate before his very eyes, penned a sceptical rhyme: "Painting of old was surely well designed/To keep the features of the dead in mind/ But this great rascal has reversed the plan/And made the pictures die before the man."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Luckily, the artist lived long enough to learn from his mistakes, says Mark Hallett, an authority on Reynolds and co-curator at the Wallace Collection in London of a new exhibition that brings the painter's experimentalism into focus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>By the 1780s he had stopped, for example, mixing red lake with white for a rosy complexion, because the colour soon drained from his subjects' faces, leaving a ghostly pallor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Wallace Collection has not only attracted loans from all over the world for the show, but also reviewed its own holding of 12 Reynolds paintings, cleaning five to remove centuries of grime and deadened varnish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That project, in common with all such renovations, was shot through with the restorer's dilemma: how far do you go?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Displays of X-ray photographs illustrate the complexity of Reynolds's layering: application upon application of pigment and glaze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That he could, for all the overpainting, suggest a wisp of gossamer, is his alchemist's art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the late 18th century, experimentation and entrepreneurship was in the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Economic structures were being challenged and the old social order was changing, the aristocracy unseated by a confident new breed of self-made men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The business people and questing scientists of the time drew no lines between wealth creation, art patronage and intellectual enquiry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Reynolds's contemporary, Josiah Wedgwood, was as interested in forging a network of canals as in formulating the perfect white glaze for his china: he was a member of the Birmingham-based Lunar Society, a group of innovators whose members' portraits were painted by Joseph Wright of Derby, perhaps best known for his thrilling, nocturnal 1768 work Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump, with its excited investigators and anxious onlookers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Against this shifting societal backdrop, Reynolds experimented wholeheartedly - not only querying established combinations of pigments, but also testing out different categories of painting, taking poses and posture to new extremes and executing a series of portraits of the same subject in different manners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He painted courtesans and heiresses with equal care, and had the resulting portraits hung side by side at prestigious exhibitions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The only distinction he made was between those portraits that were destined to show at the Royal Academy, which he helped found in 1768, and those that were for personal consumption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Elements of the latter commissions would be done by assistants, with Reynolds providing finishing touches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The result was, nonetheless, a Reynolds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The surprise, perhaps, was that women of pedigree not only tolerated their portraits to be hung alongside those of courtesans but positively welcomed the narrative colour that such association gave them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>To be painted by Reynolds was itself an event, and his sitters readily adopted the more active poses that he suggested, in contrast to the expressionless "Kneller mask" - the frozen visage that was the speciality of Sir Godfrey Kneller, who had dominated English portrait painting earlier in the century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rather, Reynolds gave them a three-dimensionality that might be lacking in their limited daily lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He was experimenting too, with light and shade, but not merely casting light on his focal points and plunging secondary features into shadow: in the Wallace's own Nelly O'Brien (1762-63), the sitter's features are shaded by the broad brim of her hat while the light falls on her decolletage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>And yet the viewer's eye is still drawn up to the slightly obscured features, peering in to see better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Reynolds knew about such scrutiny: in another radical departure, he discarded the conventions of self-portraiture and in the late 1740s depicted himself shading his gaze with his left hand, casting a shadow like an eye-mask across his face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>That Reynolds was only in his early twenties when he created this National Gallery treasure, on loan to the Wallace, speaks volumes about an artist who, from the start, was searching for difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A theatrical showman within his own studio, Reynolds devised a drama in which sitters, patrons and onlookers alike were keen to play their parts, in particular in his so-called "fancy pictures" - that is, sentimental but skillful vignettes such as the Tate's The Age of Innocence (c1785), with its tenderly posed little girl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Nevertheless, like a persuasive actor who becomes diffident when compelled to be themselves, in the drawing rooms of others, his company was considered unremarkable, says Hallett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>An underlying seriousness was manifest in his trip around Europe in young adulthood, when he was critical of other young noblemen on the educative Grand Tour who squandered their opportunities and chose sex, drink and gambling over the Great Masters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>For all his aptitude and application, when it came to painting, Reynolds had a gambling streak of his own which would make him one of his generation's most outstanding, and appealing, chancers.</td></tr>

<h3>Russia: 2 suspects detained in murder of Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>People line up to pay their respects at a ceremony for Boris Nemtsov at the Sakharov Center in Moscow on March 3, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Protesters rally March 1, 2015, in memory of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was fatally shot in Moscow on Feb. 27, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Protesters in Moscow carry pictures of Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader gunned down Feb. 27, 2015, near the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Riot police stand guard in Moscow on March 1, 2015, near where Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two men were detained in connection with last week's killing of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, the head of Russia's federal security service said Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the identification of suspects did little to quell lingering questions about the motive for the crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Alexander Bortnikov said on Russian state television that the two men - Anzor Kubashev and Zaur Dadayev, who are residents of the North Caucasus region - were detained in the criminal case concerning Nemtsov's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Russian investigative service spokesman Vladimir Markin later told the Russian news service Interfax that the two men were "responsible for the organization and perpetration of Nemtsov's killing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Ukrainian model who was with slain opposition leader Boris Nemtsov tearfully recounted their last dinner in a Red Square restaurant and their walk onto a nearby bridge - but said she did not see the gunman who pulled the trigger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But authorities have released few details about the two men they say were responsible for Nemtsov's death or why they allegedly shot one of Russia's most prominent Kremlin critics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, was walking on a bridge Feb. 27 near the Kremlin with a female companion when he was shot by an unidentified gunman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Russia's Interior Ministry said Nemtsov was killed by four shots to the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Surveillance footage broadcast on a Moscow television station the next day showed the assailants disappearing in a car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Interfax cited an unidentified source Saturday saying that the car was identified quickly and that "biological materials" in it helped lead investigators to the suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The federal security service has suggested no motive for the attack on Nemtsov, just days before he was scheduled to lead an "anti-crisis" march in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But several theories have been circulating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some members of the Russian opposition have voiced the suspicion that the Kremlin was involved in the attack, which happened in one of the most heavily policed areas in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It took 11 minutes for an emergency vehicle to arrive on the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kremlin officials have framed the assassination as a "provocation" to discredit Russian President Vladimir Putin and foment social discord.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Russian officials have also floated several theories for the killing that ignore Nemtsov's political differences with the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Russia's investigative committee has said it is looking into possible connections between Nemtsov's death and Islamic extremism, the Ukrainian conflict, Nemtsov's condemnation of the Charlie Hebdo killings in Paris and his many personal and business relationships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It said it would also consider the possibility that Nemtsov had been a "sacrificial victim" - a none-too-subtle suggestion, akin to the Kremlin's, that one of his allies killed him to smear the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A report in the Russian tabloid LifeNews even suggested Nemtsov's murder might have been connected to a recent alleged abortion his companion had sought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The companion, 23-year-old Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya, told the Russian independent television station Dozhd that she saw neither the gunman nor the make, model or plates of the car that approached them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Nemtsov's allies have expressed doubt that those responsible for his death will be brought to justice, but some offered cautious hope Saturday that the detentions would lead to positive developments in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We hope that they detained those who really are related to the murder, that it is not a mistake," Ilya Yashin, one of Nemtsov's closest allies in the opposition, told Interfax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But he added that it is "difficult to judge" the actions of law-enforcement officials since they were not providing Nemtsov's supporters with any special information on the progress of the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This is not the first time a high-profile assassination of a Kremlin critic has resulted in the detention of suspects from the North Caucasus, a volatile region straddling the border of Europe and Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The region includes Chechnya, where rebels have fought two wars against Russia in the past 20 years and which is now led by the Kremlin-backed autocrat Ramzan Kadyrov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>People from the North Caucasus have been named as suspects in the 2004 murder of Forbes editor Paul Klebnikov in Moscow, and five others were sentenced last year for the 2006 murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>As one of the country's most prominent Kremlin critics, Nemtsov belonged to a group that has felt increasingly targeted by Putin's rhetoric.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Many attribute his killing to the toxic atmosphere that has developed since Putin warned a year ago of "a fifth column" and "national traitors" undermining Russia from within.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Nemtsov had told Russia's Sobesednik news site last month that he and his relatives feared Putin might try to have him killed because of his efforts to prove Russia's responsibility for the war in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>After his assassination, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko surmised that that was the reason for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Russian officials have denied that Russia is involved in the Ukrainian conflict between pro-government forces and pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Last week, Putin called Nemtsov's slaying a "disgrace," adding that Russia had to rid itself of high-profile crimes and political murders.</td></tr>
