<h3>Bali nine executions: Prisoner swap 'unthinkable' says Indonesian Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>And Defence minister Ryamizard Ryacudu even suggested Australia execute Indonesian drug smugglers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ms Bishop raised the prospect of a prisoner swap with her Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The deal could involve three Indonesians in prison in Australia over their role in an infamous 1998 drug bust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo said a prisoner swap was irrelevant to Indonesia's plans to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"What is certain is that it has never been done and is unthinkable," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Other countries must obviously respect the Indonesian law enforcement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Ryamizard told news website detik.com: "If the Indonesians are drug smugglers just execute them too so it's equal. If there was a swap the Indonesians would be executed here but there is no guarantee the Australians would receive the death penalty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meanwhile bizarre photographs of a grinning Denpasar police chief apparently posing with Chan before he left on his final flight have emerged as anguished family members arrive in Cilacap to say their final goodbyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The media circus surrounding the executions of the Bali nine ringleaders and eight other drug felons intensified as the "happy snap" was plastered over local media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Senior Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo denied the photograph of himself with his arm draped around Chan's shoulder was a heartless selfie saying he had no idea it was being taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It was not a selfie moment," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said he was patting the men's shoulders and urging them to "Be tough, be strong, and keep going".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Meanwhile Indonesian diplomats told the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Wednesday that a moratorium on the death penalty could be reintroduced - just as the country prepared to execute 10 drug felons including Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In an interview with Al-Jazeera Indonesian president Joko Widodo said the executions would not be held this week but would take place soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are now incarcerated in isolation cells in Besi prison on Nusakambangan, which means 'iron prison', a reference to the original iron walls and roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There are seven prisons on Nusakambangan, housing 1,500 inmates, all of whom are serving over five years' imprisonment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Of the 1500, 50 are on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The head of the Law and Human Rights Ministry's Central Java office, Mirza Zulkarnain, said isolating the convicts was necessary to help them focus on themselves in the days ahead of their executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran were being kept in Besi prison because it was the closest to the killing field, Mirza was quoted saying in the Jakarta Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The 10 condemned prisoners who have been earmarked for the next round of executions will be given 72 hours' notice of their deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Their families, lawyers and consular staff will be able to visit them until 6pm on the night of the executions, which typically take place just after midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The condemned men will also be granted one last wish, such as the choice of a final meal, provided it is considered possible by the Indonesian prison authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Their bodies will be expatriated to Australia after their deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Matius Arif Mirdjaja, a pastor and close friend of Chan's who has travelled to Cilacap to see the men, was told he could not visit Besi prison on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He said on Tuesday he had visited Chan at Bali's Kerobokan jail and told him to make sure he made contact with a senior priest on his arrival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"[Chan replied] I'd be better accompanied by family. You're family."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Arif said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He said the prosecutor's office in Cilacap was still waiting for the embassies and families to provide the names of their preferred religious counsellors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Arif said Chan and Sukumaran had looked okay when he saw them on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Sukumaran was still preparing for an exhibition of his paintings to be held at the Hard Rock Cafe in Kuta on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>At that time they were unaware they would be transferred to Nusakambangan the following day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Chan's mother Helen and brother Michael and Raji, Chinthu and Brintha Sukumaran, Myuran's mother and siblings have all arrived in Cilacap with other family members and supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Arif said hope was not lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"We will never say goodbye," he said.</td></tr>

<h3>Australia hints of scaling back MH370 hunt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott Thursday suggested the search for missing Flight MH370 may be scaled back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Malaysia Airlines plane disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014 with 239 people on board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>No trace has been found despite a massive surface and underwater hunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I do reassure the families of our hope and expectation that the ongoing search will succeed," Abbott told parliament in Canberra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"My pledge is that we are taking every reasonable step to bring your uncertainty to an end."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I can't promise that the search will go on at this intensity forever but we will continue our very best efforts to resolve this mystery and provide some answers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Australia is leading the hunt in the Indian Ocean some 1,000 miles off its west coast, with four ships using sophisticated sonar systems to scour a huge underwater area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The vessels are focusing on a 23,000 square mile priority zone, with the search scheduled to end in May. More than 40 percent of the ocean floor has been explored to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The intensive search - jointly funded by Australia and Malaysia with a budget of $93 million - has so far only turned up little although it has benefitted scientists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The ships, Fugro Supporter, Fugro Equator, Fugro Discovery and GO Phoenix, are working in one of the world's most isolated locations in treacherous conditions similar to the "Roaring Forties" north of Antarctica, which are notorious among mariners for its hostile seas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If the plane isn't found by May, one option is to expand the hunt beyond the current search zone into a wider area surrounding it, Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The larger area is 425,000 square miles, or nearly 20 times the size of the current search zone, which itself is expected to take more than seven months to cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The plane, of course, could be found at any moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But officials must prepare for the possibility that it won't be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ministers from Australia, China and Malaysia will meet next month to decide whether and how to fund another phase of the search.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But if the search continues to come up empty, funds and options will one day dry up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"If it's a search that has no hope, then there has to be a line drawn in the sand where ultimately somebody's going to have to make that decision," says U.K.-based airline security analyst Chris Yates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There's going to have to be some soul-searching."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The agency coordinating the search, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, has previously said a decision on continuing after the current hunt was completed was up to the Australian and Malaysian governments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Abbott said the plane's disappearance "demonstrated a fundamental gap in tracking long-haul flights, particularly over the oceans."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia plan to hold trials of a "world first" system that increases the tracking of aircraft over remote oceans to a minimum rate of every 15 minutes from current intervals of 30 to 40 minutes.</td></tr>
