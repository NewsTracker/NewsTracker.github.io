<h3>Hillary Clinton Calls For Campaign Finance Constitutional Amendment</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hillary Clinton participates in a roundtable discussion with students and educators during a campaign event at the Kirkwood Community College April 14 in Monticello, Iowa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On the third day of her nascent presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton began to put some meat on the bones of her policy vision, calling for a constitutional amendment, if necessary, to "get unaccountable money out of [politics] once and for all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Speaking at a community college in rural Iowa on Tuesday, Clinton broached the possibility of a constitutional amendment to fix a "dysfunctional" campaign finance system as a piece of one of four pillars that would be the focus of her presidency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The other three priorities were building an economy for the future, strengthening families and communities and bolstering national security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the mention of a constitutional amendment was the most specific policy remedy she's uttered since becoming a 2016 Democratic candidate for the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Without noting them specifically, the former secretary of state was implicitly referring to a pair of 2010 Supreme Court cases that opened the floodgates for super PACs, committees which can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions and individuals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Super PACs have dominated the political system since then, allowing outside entities unaffiliated with a candidate to dominate spending in a given race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It's unclear how Clinton defines "unaccountable money" and she didn't detail the contours of the constitutional amendment she might propose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But such a drastic prescription lays down an early and emphatic marker on the issue of big money in politics and doing so should help endear her to liberals and campaign finance reform advocates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"She's tapping into a deep-seated belief among people of all political stripes that we have to reclaim our democracy from corporations and billionaires," said Marge Baker, vice president of People For the American Way, a liberal interest group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Republicans swiftly dubbed Clinton a hypocrite, given that her allies have already formed super PACs to support her candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even some Democrats wondered how Clinton would square this position without denouncing Ready For Hillary and Priorities USA, the two entities that have most prominently backed her candidacy financially without contribution restrictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Clinton's mere utterance of a constitutional amendment will pull the issue to the forefront and force her pack of potential Republican challengers to address it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>During a stop in New Hampshire last week, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is exploring a 2016 bid, also said a constitutional amendment was needed to rein in spending in political campaigns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"You're gonna get sick of watching TV in New Hampshire, so the next president of the United States needs to get a commission of really smart people and find a way to create a constitutional amendment to limit the role of super PACs, because there's gonna be like $100 million spent on races in New Hampshire," he said during an appearance on WMUR-TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Eventually, we're gonna destroy American politics with so much money in the political process cause they're going to turn you off to wanting to vote."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But there's a reason such constitutional amendments are rare: The hurdle to passage is set exceedingly high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Is Hillary Clinton Taking 'Blood Phosphate' Money From Morocco?</td></tr>
