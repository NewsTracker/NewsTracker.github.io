<h3>Clinton: Arctic drilling ?not worth the risk?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that the current drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean is "not worth the risk."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Arctic is a unique treasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Given what we know, it's not worth the risk of drilling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A campaign spokesperson later tweeted that Clinton's message is in reference to off-shore drilling in the Arctic Ocean, an issue that has become a flashpoint for environmentalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton's tweet comes the day after the Obama administration gave Royal Dutch Shell final approval to explore for oil beneath the Chukchi Sea off the northeastern coast of Alaska.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Clinton has previously said she was "skeptical" about drilling in the Arctic, telling a New Hampshire news outlet in July that, "I don't think it is a necessary part of our clean energy, climate change agenda."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Her clarified position is likely to bolster her standing among greens, some of whom have previously questioned her focus on environmental issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton began rolling out her climate change agenda last month but didn't address several issues important to environmentalists, including Arctic drilling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clinton's two rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, have both previously come out against Arctic and offshore drilling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida, responded with his own tweet on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Wrong," the Bush campaign tweeted to Clinton.</td></tr>
