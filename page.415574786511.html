<h3>Detroit resident finally feels at home next to wacky public art project</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Artist Tyree Guyton started it nearly 30 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Otila Bell settles into a chair on the front porch of her house, swaddled in coats, sweaters and blankets to ward off the bitter chill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A box of felt-tip markers sits on a table beside her, and steam rises temptingly from a large thermos filled with hot chocolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The icy street is silent on this Saturday afternoon, but not for long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Hey, you wanna sign my house?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bell hollers as a young couple meander into view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's only $1!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The pair look at each other uncertainly and move on, but Bell's high, girlish voice carries, and within minutes her porch is filled with people waiting to hand over $1 and autograph one of Detroit's most unusual urban salvation ventures: Bell's yellow house, whose steps, front porch, columns and part of the roof have been rehabbed using signers' dollars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>There are signatures from Papua New Guinea, Ukraine, Germany and Brazil, with messages scrawled in a variety of languages and colors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Anthony Bourdain's above the front door may be the most famous on the house, but it is not the most exotic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>To understand how Bell, 62, got into this, you have to look at the houses and yards surrounding her property on Heidelberg Street, in a desolate area east of downtown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nearly 30 years ago, an artist named Tyree Guyton, who grew up on the street, began transforming the decaying residential area into what he considered an art project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Empty lots sprouted sculptures made of castoff toys, broken dolls and old appliances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Vacant houses were painted in multihued, whimsical designs, and giant polka dots appeared on the pavement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fences were adorned with old shoes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Bell's house was in the midst of this cornucopia of color, and she was not happy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"To me it was junk," said Bell, whose house has been in her family for more than 40 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She was particularly dismayed to see crosses planted in a vacant lot where homes had once stood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But she softened over the years as it became clear that the Heidelberg Project was bringing some joy to this sliver of the vast, economically withering city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In July 2012, after prodding from relatives, Bell decided that the best - actually the only - method for raising money to repair her 124-year-old home's exterior was to take advantage of the Heidelberg Project's popularity by inviting passers-by to autograph her house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Bell's change of heart was a coup for the project, which from its beginnings has faced resistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The city bulldozed it twice in the 1990s amid complaints it was an eyesore and nuisance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Since May 2013, fires blamed on arsonists have destroyed several of the project's houses, leaving charred remnants of what used to be cheerful urban canvases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Heidelberg Project has since erected surveillance cameras and floodlights, improving security on the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Winning new fans can only help the nonprofit organization, which offers arts programs for neighborhood children and sells works by local artists from a tiny gift shop next to the house where Guyton grew up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The project gives people hope. It's not so gloomy here," said Stacy Risner, the Heidelberg Project's community coordinator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>When the daytime temperature is above 25 degrees, Risner works weekends at the gift store, and she makes a point of telling visitors to walk up the street to Bell's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Bell, she notes, used to be one of the project's loudest critics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Bell even was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey in 1991 for a show on so-called public nuisances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Now she's one of our biggest fans," Risner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Bell shares her Victorian home with her son, Melvin, and daughter, Tajauana, who on this day had taped clear plastic along the side of the porch to shield her mother from the wind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The plastic rippled in the breeze, but Bell showed no sign of being cold as she eyed the street below, like royalty keeping watch on her subjects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Most days, if weather permits, Bell spends time on the porch, and Saturday and Sunday afternoons are her busiest period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Cars slowly purr down the street, their occupants snapping pictures and sometimes parking and getting out for a closer look at the Heidelberg Project creations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Bell's porch looks out on a lot dotted with the kinds of things she once disdained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Stuffed animals are piled high into a colorful boat, which seems in danger of capsizing as a giraffe prepares to board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Spider-Man and a couple of baby dolls, one without a head, occupy a bench facing the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Wooden slabs painted as clock faces, each showing a different time, are scattered across the landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>On the far end of the lot sits the frame of a house, covered in vinyl record albums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>To the left of Bell's house is the one where Guyton once lived, its white wood covered in cheerful - some might say gaudy - polka dots in a rainbow of colors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The tree growing outside that house is topped with a couple of shopping carts, and its trunk is covered with toys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Bell's house looks normal, until you look closer and see the signatures on the porch ceiling, the columns and every exterior wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Some are faded from years of exposure to rain, snow and blazing sun, but their traces are visible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Julien Guye, on a business trip from Paris, handed his dollar to Bell, picked out a purple marker and walked to the side of the house to scrawl a brief message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"It's a fun way to help someone who needs it," Guye said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Bell's hope is to raise enough money to paint her house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>That would cover up the signatures, but it doesn't worry Bell, who has no idea how long it will take before she can paint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Money raised so far has gone toward rehab work that needs to be done first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>One thing is certain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Bell is not sold on the idea that stuffed animals stuck on trees or wildly painted houses are art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>When she paints her house, it will be yellow with brown trim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>But Bell has grown to appreciate the effect of her fanciful surroundings, which draw visitors year-round to a neighborhood once headed for blight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>"It looks nice now. It looks real nice," Bell said approvingly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>"We have one of the nicest places around."</td></tr>

<h3>Analysis: Why Netanyahu? It's more than just nationalism</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's a mystery to many: Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign gained steam when he ruled out the creation of a Palestinian state, and he seems determined to continue settling occupied land with Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>So why would Israelis again back policies that promise friction of all kinds - and will dramatically dilute the Jewish character of their hard-won state by making it eventually inseparable from the millions of Palestinians in the West Bank?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The answer lies in the details of a conundrum so complicated that the dynamics of democracy seem hardly able to contain it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tellingly, perhaps, the campaign did not even focus on the grand strategic issue that is now presented as having been decided: Instead the opposition pledged to address bread-and-butter issues, like the high cost of living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The outcome may be different under circumstances that force the Palestinian issue to the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If international boycott initiatives start exacting an economic price on a country that appreciates its high standard of living, or if the Europeans who are Israel's top trading partners take off the gloves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Or if the Palestinians rebel, creating a major security headache, or the United States steps in with peace proposals backed by muscle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Another game-changer would be if the moderate opposition united behind a truly compelling candidate after a succession of leaders who were simply not perceived by enough people as ready for prime time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The last Labor Party leader to achieve an effective brand of gravitas was one-time military chief Ehud Barak, who won in 1999.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Very few Israelis see the 48-year-old West Bank occupation as purely a nationalist conceit, greedy and anti-Palestinian, though that narrative certainly has currency in the region and around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>From a Palestinian perspective, the West Bank and Gaza Strip combined are just about a fifth of historic Palestine - the bare minimum that is acceptable from their perspective in order to formally accept the existence of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But what Israelis see is a pre-1967 border that is basically just a cease-fire line from the 1948-49 war that established the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Without the West Bank, Israel is only about 10 miles (15 kilometers) wide at its narrowest point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The strategic highland looms over Israeli cities, visible on a clear day from the outskirts of Tel Aviv and surrounding Jerusalem on three sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They fear that if their army clears out it will be replaced not by peaceful Palestinian moderates but more menacing forces like Hamas - which took over the Gaza Strip soon after Israel handed it fully to the Palestinian autonomy government of Mahmoud Abbas in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The fact that Islamic State militants are menacing the region does not help, and was exploited by Netanyahu during a campaign in which he portrayed the militants in one TV ad as charging toward Jerusalem, with naive Israeli leftists even helpfully pointing the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On several occasions Israeli governments have offered the Palestinians statehood on close to all of the West Bank and Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A quarter century's worth of futile negotiations appears to stem from Israel's refusal to accept a return of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, who potentially number in the millions, and from the tremendous difficulty of sharing the holy city Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The idea of a border running right through it - with Palestinian police controlling entrances to the Old City a stone's throw from downtown pubs and hotels - is unfathomable to many Israelis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Because so few think a peace deal is likely, the opposition runs away from the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>If elected they might offer types of concessions: perhaps a unilateral pullout from some areas; maybe a push for an interim deal which today the Palestinians refuse to contemplate; in any case, a freeze on settlements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But the issue is so complicated that they have found their position difficult to sell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Many Israelis console themselves with the islands of Palestinian autonomy established in the 1990s in the West Bank: perhaps they might suffice to make the "demographic issue" go away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Israel's fractured politics leave little room for maneuver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A look at the electoral map shows a huge proportion of parliament that is almost guaranteed to go to sectarian and ethnic interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>More than a third of the new parliament will be occupied by parties that target certain groups and have a near-guaranteed vote that has little to do with the Palestinian issue: Israeli Arabs, Russian immigrants, traditionally-inclined Sephardic Jews and different shades of religious Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Even the major parties, which theoretically stand for ideology, to a degree appeal to specific groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This is especially true of Likud, which has a tremendously loyal base among working-class Israelis who hail from the Arab world and tend to be hawkish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They still resent the leftist establishment that founded Israel for the reception they got as immigrants a half-century ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Many speak of the party as a "home" that is "in our blood" and cannot conceivably be "betrayed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>On top of that, the religious sector, aligned with the right, has the country's highest birthrate by far, and so can be expected to constantly add to its automatic storehouse of votes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Netanyahu, known popularly as Bibi, is a brilliant campaigner who not only does and says what it takes to get elected but seems comfortable doing so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In the final week of the campaign he realized that the perception of victory, in Israel's fragmented political space, would depend more on his party than his bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>So he tacked to the right, taking votes from his nationalist ally, the Jewish Home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>On Tuesday, that meant issuing dire warnings that Israeli Arab citizens were streaming to the polls, which shocked many Israelis and brought charges of racism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>A few days earlier, he had sounded the alarm against an international conspiracy supposedly amassed to "topple" him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He also energized his base by declaring that if re-elected he would never allow a Palestinian state - walking away from a 2009 declaration that itself had reversed his previous position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But so profound is the cynicism surrounding Israeli politics that many people view the zigzags as little more than political sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Also effective was Netanyahu's controversial appearance two weeks ago on Capitol Hill, where he argued against President Barack Obama's supposedly impending nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Mortified, the Israeli opposition could not disagree with the substance of his speech - but warned of a crisis with the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The relatively polite response from the U.S. administration was, to Netanyahu's fans at least, another sign that he has things well in hand.</td></tr>
