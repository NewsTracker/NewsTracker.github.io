<h3>Nissan to build $160M supplier park at Tennessee plant that will attract more than 1,000 jobs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- Nissan Motor Co. announced plans Tuesday to build a new $160 million supplier park at its Tennessee assembly plant that the Japanese automaker projects to attract more than 1,000 jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nissan North America Chairman Jose Munoz called the supplier park a key component in the company's drive toward capturing 10 percent of the U.S. market share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Nissan has continued to invest in Tennessee because you have created a business environment that encourages growth and innovation," Munoz said at a ceremony at the state Capitol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gov. Bill Haslam noted that Nissan has more than 12,000 Nissan employees between its Smyrna complex and an engine plant in Decherd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We make things in Tennessee, and we're proud of that," Haslam said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We make cars and guitars and candy and whiskey and a whole lot of other things."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the governor said the automotive industry is particularly important to the state, "because it means a ripple effect of suppliers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The automaker's plans call for the new 1.5 million-square-foot logistics center to be built in phases starting next year and completed by the end of 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>More than 8,400 people work at the Nissan plant that built 648,000 vehicles last year, making it the highest-producing plant in North America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The plant, which opened in 1983, makes the Altima, Maxima, Leaf, Rogue, Pathfinder and Infiniti QX60.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>John Martin, the senior vice president for Nissan North America's manufacturing, purchasing and supply chain management, said the goal is to cut down on transportation costs and to have a more direct hand in quality control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The growth in the automobile sector means many suppliers are already reaching capacity at their current locations, and Nissan wants them to consider locating new production at the new supplier park instead of at existing facilities in the Midwest.</td></tr>

<h3>Despite Tie, Netanyahu Secures Shot at 4th Term as Israel PM</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israel's election has yielded a fractured parliament and no clear winner, setting up a horse-trading phase that seems likely to leave Netanyahu in his post and place the country on the brink of confrontation with the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It could also force a joint government with moderate challenger Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And there is the slimmest of chances that Herzog, through machinations, ends up on top.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Everything is in the hands of Moshe Kahlon, a relative newcomer to the big leagues of Israeli politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israel's parliament election ended in a deadlock, according to TV exit polls, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to hold the advantage ahead of coalition talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Here is a look at how the main players fared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu's Likud Party came from behind after trailing in the polls to pull roughly even with its main rival, the center-left Zionist Union led by Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The comeback, fueled by an aggressive appeal to his hard-line base, gave Netanyahu a strong shot at securing a fourth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both he and Herzog now compete for a chance to form a coalition that commands a majority in the 120-seat parliament, a complicated task in Israel's fractured political landscape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some say Netanyahu has a better chance than Herzog of cobbling together a government, by courting his "natural allies," rightist and religious parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Herzog would have to appeal to more ideologically diverse allies, including hard-liners and religious parties, and perhaps Arab parties, to build a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kahlon, the 54-year-old leader of an upstart centrist party, Kulanu, is seen as the kingmaker of the inconclusive elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With his party's predicted 10 seats, according to TV exit polls, Kahlon would have a decisive say in who becomes the next prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kahlon has said his main objective is to become Israel's next finance minister in order to carry out economic reforms and lower the cost of living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Kahlon hasn't said whom he favors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He has deep political roots in the Likud but fell out with Netanyahu two years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This unprecedented union of four largely Arab-backed factions became Israel's third largest party - with 13 seats, according to exit polls - and gave Israel's Arab minority significant leverage in parliament for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Party leader Ayman Odeh said Tuesday that the Joint List will try to prevent the formation of a Netanyahu-led government, but will not join a Herzog-run coalition - to avoid having to be party to decisions on possible military campaigns or building more Jewish settlements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the event of a Netanyahu-Herzog unity government, the Joint List expects to take on the high profile role of leader of the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>When Netanyahu called early elections three months ago, Herzog and his Labor Party were seen as politically too weak to mount an effective challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Herzog confounded expectations, rising in the polls after joining forces with former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and her centrist Tnuah party to form an alliance they called the Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Despite his quiet demeanor and perceived lack of charisma, Herzog emerged as a credible candidate for prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He has a long shot at the top job, if he can persuade Kahlon to back him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Netanyahu's ultra-nationalist foreign minister last year promoted legislation raising the vote threshold for parties getting into parliament - and almost became a victim of his own initiative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Lieberman's Israel Beitenu barely crossed the threshold with five seats, according to exit polls, a sharp drop from the 2013 election when his joint list with Likud won 31 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Despite his hawkish views, Lieberman hasn't said if he will endorse Netanyahu.</td></tr>
