<h3>Low wages, trade deals luring auto plants and jobs to Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mexico has become the most attractive place in North America to build new automobile factories, a shift that has siphoned jobs from the U.S. and Canada, yet helped keep car and truck prices in check for consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the past two years, eight automakers have opened or announced new plants or expansions in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Just last week, Toyota announced a new plant in Guanajuato to build the popular Corolla, work now done in Canada, while Ford unveiled plans for Mexican engine and transmission factories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Low labor costs and fewer tariffs are the swing factors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A worker in Mexico costs car companies an average of $8 an hour, including wages and benefits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That compares with $58 in the U.S. for General Motors and $38 at Volkswagen's factory in Tennessee, the lowest hourly cost in the U.S., according to the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>German auto workers cost about $52 an hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mexico also trumps the U.S. on free trade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It has agreements with 45 countries, meaning low tariffs for exporting globally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That, along with low labor costs, convinced Audi to build an SUV factory in the state of Puebla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The German automaker will save $6,000 per vehicle in tariffs when it ships a Q5 to Europe, compared with building the same vehicle in the U.S., says Sean McAlinden, chief economist at CAR.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Audi also sells the Q5 in the U.S., where tariffs on cars built in Mexico were dropped under the North American Free Trade Agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The cost savings also should allow automakers to add expensive fuel-saving features to meet stricter U.S. government gas mileage requirements without raising car prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While Mexico's auto industry booms and workers welcome the above-average wages, they are speaking out more loudly about working conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mexican auto production more than doubled in the past 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The consulting firm IHS Automotive expects it to rise another 50 percent to just under 5 million by 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>U.S. production is expected to increase only 3 percent, to 12.2 million vehicles, in the next 7 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Automakers now have 18 factories in Mexico, many built in the past 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In four years, five more will be built, moving the country from the world's seventh-biggest auto producer to fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The shift means jobs that could have gone to the U.S. or Canada went south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The number of auto-making jobs in Mexico has risen almost 40 percent since 2008, from 490,000 to 675,000 last year, according to government and industry statistics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>During the same period, U.S. auto manufacturing employment grew 15 percent to nearly 903,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Toyota's new plant will create 2,000 new jobs, while Ford's $2.5 billion investment will add 3,800 jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>For Mexican workers, the plants "originally appear like marvelous places because you can earn a salary in exchange for good work," says Huberto Juarez, a professor at the Center for the Study of Economic and Social Development at the Autonomous University of Puebla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Some Japanese automaker plants start workers at 90 to 150 pesos per day, or $6 to $10, Juarez says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Others, such as Volkswagen, have paid more than double that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Juarez says Mexico's auto-making wages are now below China, but better than Mexico's minimum wage of $4.50 per day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>There is pressure to improve working conditions at Mexican factories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Last week, three former Mazda factory workers publicly complained of injuries and of being worked longer than legally allowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A union official announced protests in support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Even so, Juarez says workers probably will stay put.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"The big threat is always going to be unemployment. That's why they stay. Because you leave there and where are you going to go?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Initially, automakers with Mexican factories faced quality problems due to an unskilled work force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But companies with longtime factories in Mexico, such as Ford and Nissan, have resolved those issues, according to McAlinden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Despite shipping costs, it's still cheaper to build cars for the U.S. in Mexico, McAlinden says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>A U.S.-built Chevrolet Sonic subcompact costs about $700 more to make than a comparable Mexican-built Ford Fiesta, McAlinden says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>That's even with a labor agreement at the Sonic factory in Michigan that allows 40 percent of the workers to be paid lower wages than longtime union employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The United Auto Workers complain that companies building in Mexico are taking advantage of "slave-like" wages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"American manufacturing workers could have had good paying jobs that respect basic human dignity," says UAW President Dennis Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Still, the auto industry's investments aren't limited to Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Automakers poured $46 billion into improving U.S. factories from 2010 to 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>U.S. auto-making employment grew 37 percent during that time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Ford pointed out that 80 percent of its annual North American investments are in the U.S., where spending "will continue at about the same sizeable level going forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Car buyers should see benefits from lower costs in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>U.S. government fuel-economy requirements call for raising mileage of the new car fleet to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The technologies needed, including turbocharged engines and multi-speed transmissions, are costly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>And with gasoline just over $2 per gallon, buyers don't want to pay extra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>So McAlinden says moving engine and transmission production to Mexico makes sense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"There's no room for labor costs," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>FILE - In this March 14, 2014 photo, assembly line workers build a 2015 Chrysler 200 automobile at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in Sterling Heights, Mich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Lured by low wages and tax-saving free trade agreements, auto companies from the U.S. and overseas are accelerating plans to build new factories and add jobs in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The moves, part of a decade-long trend, are luring investments and work that could have gone to the U.S. and Canada, according to experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>But they also are likely to keep car and truck prices in check even as automakers add expensive fuel-saving features to meet U.S. gas mileage requirements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>FILE - In this June 12, 2013, file photo, workers assemble Volkswagen Passat sedans at the German automaker's plant in Chattanooga, Tenn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>FILE - In this March 11, 2013 file photo, an employee of Audi works in the assembly line of the Audi production site in Ingolstadt, southern Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Mexico is attracting luxury automakers such as Audi and BMW because of free trade agreements with 45 countries that reduce tariffs.</td></tr>
