<h3>Dutch hostage freed from Mali militants thanks French troops</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Dutch train driver held for more than three years by Islamic militants said Thursday he stayed fit during his captivity by working out with improvised equipment and ate pasta so often that he doesn't want to see another plate of it any time soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sjaak Rijke also thanked the French special forces troops who rescued him on Monday in northern Mali, according to a written statement distributed by the Dutch foreign ministry.</td></tr>
