<tr><td>9</td><td>Once a totem of Kenya's growing prosperity, the Westgate building has since become symbolic of growing insecurity in the east African nation and President Uhuru Kenyatta's inability to prevent frequent Islamist attacks on Kenyan soil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Images beamed across the world during the September 2013 raid dented Kenya's image abroad and scared off tourists, damaging a vital sector of the economy.</td></tr>
