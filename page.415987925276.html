<h3>Kenyatta says Garissa attackers 'embedded' in Kenya Muslim community</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Saturday that those behind an attack in which Al-Shabab fighters killed 148 people at a university were "deeply embedded" in Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He called on Kenyan Muslims to help prevent radicalization, as the group pledged more attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kenyatta's televised speech in response to Thursday's 15-hour siege at the Garissa university campus came after the Interior Ministry said five suspects in the assault had been detained, some while trying to flee to Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Four suspects were Kenyans of Somali origin, and the fifth was Tanzanian, the ministry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The suspected mastermind, Mohamed Mohamud, a former teacher at a Garissa Islamic school, is still on the run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kenya has offered $215,000 reward for his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Four attackers died at Garissa, but Kenya has not named them or announced their nationalities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The authorities put their bullet-ridden, swollen bodies on display on Saturday, hoping that crowds coming to view the corpses might identify them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities," Kenyatta said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Radicalization that breeds terrorism is not conducted in the bush at night. It occurs in the full glare of day, in [Islamic schools], in homes and in mosques with rogue imams."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earlier on Saturday, Al-Shabab warned of more attacks in Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Kenyan cities will run red with blood," said Al-Shabab according to the SITE global security monitoring group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The group said the attack on Garissa college was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the group in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath," said Al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The attack at Garissa, which lies 120 miles from the Somali border, has put Kenya on high alert and spooked its Christian communities after reports the gunmen sought out Christian students while sparing some Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Kenyatta's comments will put more pressure on Kenya's Muslim community, who make up about 10 percent of the 44-million-strong population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>More than 400 people have been killed by Al-Shabab on Kenyan soil since he took power two years ago, including 67 people who died during a siege in September 2013 on a Nairobi shopping mall.</td></tr>
