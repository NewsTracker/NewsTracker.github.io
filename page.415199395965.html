<h3>Pete Stark's son launches campaign for elected office</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Pete Stark's college-age son has launched a campaign for elected office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fortney "Fish" Stark announced Tuesday that he's running for the Ward 1 seat on the Board of Alders in New Haven, Connecticut, to represent a swath of the city that includes most of Yale's undergraduate campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Stark, 19, is in his sophomore year studying political science at Yale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I love New Haven, and I love Yale, and I know that these two communities are strongest when we engage meaningfully with one another and work together towards progressive change," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I'm running because I want to work to bridge the divide between Yalies and the city. Yale students should be proud to call themselves New Haveners, and earn that identity through meaningful participation -- and New Haveners should feel respected and supported by Yale."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Stark wrote that he wants to continue the work and experiences he has had in New Haven so far: working over the summer for an after-school and weekend enrichment program for local youths; serving on the city's Peace Commission; serving on the Yale College Democrats' board; and more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I hope that we can use this election as a platform to start community-wide conversations about what meaningful, respectful engagement in New Haven looks like, and how we can create a campus climate that supports this positive citizenship," he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The elder Fortney "Pete" Stark, now 83, represented part of the East Bay in Congress for 40 years, earning a reputation as a liberal lion who crusaded for health care and against various wars; as Congress' only avowed atheist; and as a curmudgeon with a penchant for direct, if not salty, language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He lost his seat to fellow Democrat Eric Swalwell, D-Dublin, in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He raised his son -- and with his wife, Deborah Roderick Stark, is still raising 13-year-old twins -- in Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It's been no secret that Fish Stark would be angling for a political career.</td></tr>

<h3>Kenya: Businessmen, ex-officials charged for fraud</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Eight suspects were charged with conspiracy to commit an economic crime for a scheme to defraud the government of $44.6 million in contracts to modernize police equipment, including computerizing police force operations, according to charge sheets from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two suspects, including a senator, were charged with abuse of office and breach of public trust for the procurement of communication services, said the sheets presented in court by public prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Seven suspects denied charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The others weren't in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Two businesses were also charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In 2006, former presidential adviser on corruption, John Githongo, released documents alleging high level corruption in the issuance of 18 contracts dubbed the "Anglo Leasing scandal".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The officials and businessmen were charged Wednesday for their alleged involvement in some of these contracts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An audit of 18 government contracts showed that all were awarded without seeking bids from competitors and suppliers were not required to submit invoices, delivery notes or certificates of completion of works, a local newspaper quoted then Controller and Auditor-General Evan Mwai as saying in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some of the security contracts were awarded to companies whose offices could not be traced at addresses indicated in the agreements, according to the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Githongo has linked the failure to set up the security projects- which were part of the awarded contracts- to the country's struggle to contain extremist attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If the Anglo Leasing security contracts that are still being investigated today 10 years later, hadn't been predated upon, hadn't been 'eaten', we'd (be) far more ready than we are for the potentially existential threat al-Shabab poses to Kenya's State," Githongo told The Associated Press by email from Stanford University, California, where he is a visiting scholar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Al-Shabab extremists from Somalia have carried out 129 attacks in Kenya since Oct. 2011 saying its retribution for the Kenyan troop presence in Somalia.</td></tr>
