<h3>Trade body rules against US on 'dolphin-safe' tuna</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The U.S. revised rules in 2013 following a previous WTO ruling but Mexico returned to the Geneva-based trade body, arguing they still treat Mexican tuna less favorably than fish from elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A panel found Tuesday that tougher tracking and verification requirements are applied to the Eastern Tropical Pacific, where Mexican boats operate, than elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It said different requirements are applied "in a manner that constitutes unjustifiable and arbitrary discrimination."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Schools of tuna tend to gather and swim around some species of dolphins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fishermen often have located tuna by tracking dolphins with speedboats and helicopters, then circling them with nets to get at tuna underneath.</td></tr>
