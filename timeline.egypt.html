<li>Egypt strikes back at Islamic State militants after beheading video, killing dozens</li>
<li>CAIRO: Egypt said it bombed Islamic State targets inside Libya, a day after the group released a video appearing to show the beheading of 21 Egyptians there.</li>
<li>It was the first time Egypt confirmed launching air strikes against the group in Libya, suggesting President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is ready to escalate his battle against militants seeking to topple his government.</li>
<li>Libya said it had joined and co-ordinated with Egypt on the strikes.</li>
<li>Egypt's military said the dawn strike hit Islamic State camps, training sites and weapons storage areas.</li>
<li>In a phone call to Al Arabiya television, Brigadier Saqer al-Joroushi, the commander of the air force loyal to Libya's official government, said more air strikes would be carried out in co-ordination with Egypt.</li>
<li>Egypt, the most populous Arab state, has not taken part directly in the US-led air strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, focusing instead on the increasingly complex insurgency within its own borders.</li>
<li>Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with Sinai Province, a group operating from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.</li>

<li>The airstrikes bring Egypt overtly into Libya's turmoil, a reflection of Cairo's increasing alarm.</li>
<li>Egypt now faces threats on two fronts " a growing stronghold of radicals on its western border and a militant insurgency of Islamic State allies on its eastern flank in the Sinai Peninsula " as well as its own internal challenges.</li>
<li>The announcement on state radio represents Egypt's first public acknowledgement of military action in post-Moammar Gadhafi Libya, where there has been almost no government control.</li>
<li>Thirteen of the 21 came from Egypt's tiny Christian-majority village of el-Aour, where relatives wept in church and shouted the names of the dead on Monday.</li>
<li>Without publicly acknowledging it, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates carried out airstrikes against Islamist-allied militias last year, according to U.S. officials.</li>
<li>Egypt already has been amassing intelligence on extremists in Libya in a joint effort with the Libyan armed forces and West European nations, including France.</li>
<li>France, a lead player in the campaign to oust Gadhafi, has campaigned for months for some kind of international action in Libya, and announced a deal Monday to sell fighter jets to Egypt.</li>
