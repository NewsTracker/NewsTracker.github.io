<h3>Execution as spectacle: why the Bali nine duo were treated like the world's most dangerous men</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of masked and heavily armed security personnel took Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, reformed and compliant prisoners by all accounts, to Nusakambangan prison complex on Wednesday, shadowed by Sukhoi fighter jets equipped with missiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Meanwhile, on the same day, another drug smuggler was transported in a small van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bizarre and degrading spectacle is part of a trend, not just in the executions of drug felons, but of the presidency of Joko Widodo, widely known as Jokowi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lauded upon his election as a progressive force from outside Indonesia's graft-ridden elites, Jokowi as president has emerged as a leader much more like the man he defeated, former military hardman and ultra-nationalist Prabowo Subianto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jokowi is sincere about grappling with the drugs problem in Indonesia, even if he has a poor understanding of the dimensions and cause of the "national crisis".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But, from the outset, he has used the kind of anti-foreign theatrics popular with Indonesia's first leader Sukarno, who was the father of Jokowi's political patron Megawati Soekarnoputri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>While Sukarno used nationalist rhetoric to distract the population from a collapsing economy, Jokowi has engaged in the same tactics at a time when his personal popularity has been on the slide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Andrew Chan is transferred from Bali for execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jokowi has mishandled the issue that concerns Indonesians most - the rampant corruption in its police force, judiciary and other national institutions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As the police have threatened to arrest members of the respected Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), Jokowi has put forward two candidates for police chief identified as having "suspicious bank accounts".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As the scandal engulfed him, Jokowi called in the navy to blow up captured illegal fishing boats before invited television crews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Soon after, Jokowi announced he would rapidly accelerate executions as he declared a drugs emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The awful irony is that eradicating corruption in the police and judiciary would be a far more effective tool in combating drug trafficking than killing low level couriers and organisers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The kingpins invariably get off in Indonesia by paying large bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It is instructive that almost half of the 64 drug felons on death row are Indonesians but, of the six killed so far and 10 slated to face the firing squad in the near future, 14 are foreigners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Australian government is not entirely blameless in all this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It, too, has fomented hostile sentiment in Indonesia, not least Tony Abbott's remarks tying tsunami aid to clemency for Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Australia has also burned the fishing boats of Indonesians who have strayed into Australian waters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Then there were the incursions by Australian navy vessels into Indonesian waters to "turn back the boats" laden with asylum seekers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Both policies have angered Indonesians, and ripened the climate for Jokowi to exploit nationalist sentiment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That will happen when nine men and one woman - including Chan and Sukumaran - will be lined up in a clearing in the jungles of Nusakambangan and shot dead simultaneously by 120 police officers.</td></tr>

<h3>U.S. ambassador to South Korea wounded in slashing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lippert, who also suffered a wound to his left arm, was shown in news photographs taken immediately following the attack clutching the wound to the right side of his face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was taken to a Seoul hospital, where he was listed in stable condition after surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He needed 80 stitches to close a 4-inch gash that started under his cheekbone and stretched across his cheek to his jawbone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The wound was more than an inch deep, hospital officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The suspect, a 55-year-old known agitator named Kim Ki-jong, was motivated by what he saw as America's interference in Korean affairs.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>"South and North Korea should be reunified!" he shouted during the attack, according to reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The United States backed South Korea militarily during the Korean War, fought against the communist North from 1950-1953.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The rival Koreas are separated by a heavily militarized border, and America has almost 30,000 troops stationed in the South.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some in South Korea see the presence of U.S. troops in the South as deterring the North from pushing for reunification, a viewpoint promoted by the North, a police state that ranks among the world's most secretive regimes, the AP reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The U.S. Department of State issued a statement condemning the shocking act of political violence, and noted that Lippert would recover from his wounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Lippert, who had been set to give a speech to the breakfast meeting about the prospects for peace on the divided peninsula, added a message on Twitter: "Doing well&in great spirits! Robyn, Sejun, Grigsby & I - deeply moved by the support! Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK alliance! !"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The wound to Lippert's left arm damaged nerves connected to his pinkie and tendons connected to his thumb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Doctors believe he would experience sensory problems for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Video taken moments after the attack showed the suspect being tackled to the ground and dragged away by local authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Kim was well known to authorities in Seoul for being part of a band of hard-core activists who use violence to highlight their grievances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity because an investigation was ongoing, said the suspect threw a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador in Seoul in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>South Korean media reported at the time that Kim was later sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term for that attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kim was protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He missed the ambassador with the concrete and hit his secretary instead, the reports said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Kim also reportedly tried to set himself on fire with gasoline while protesting in front of the presidential Blue House in October 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He was demanding a government investigation into an alleged 1988 rape in Kim's office, according to news reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Lippert became U.S. Ambassador to South Korea last year and has been generally popular during his time in Seoul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>His wife gave birth there and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Lippert was formerly the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian Affairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Kim also mentioned during Thursday's attack a point that anti-U.S. protesters in Seoul have made in recent demonstrations: annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>North Korea says the military exercises are preparation for an invasion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Seoul and Washington argue that the drills, which will run until the end of April, are defensive in nature and routine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>North Korea each year reacts with fury to the drills, and responds with military exercises of its own and weapons tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In 2013 North Korea threatened nuclear strikes on Washington and Seoul; and on the first day of this year's drills, Monday, it test-fired short-range missiles.</td></tr>
