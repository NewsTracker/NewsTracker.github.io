<h3>Kenya shuts money transfer firms</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The bank accounts of 86 individuals and "entities" had also been frozen, Joseph Nkaissery added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Those targeted are believed to include a Somali-linked bus company and hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An assault by the Somalia-headquartered al-Shabab group killed 148 people at Kenya's Garissa University last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kenyan officials have repeatedly accused Somalis in the country of colluding with the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nearly 500,000 refugees are in the country - many of whom fled decades of conflict and drought in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kenya also has its own Somali population - most of whom live in the capital, Nairobi, and in the north-east, where the university attack took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Somalis say most of them are law-abiding citizens of Kenya, and they have also bore the brunt of al-Shabab's insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They have condemned the government's crackdown as "blanket punishment" of the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>BBC Africa's Abdullahi Abdi in Nairobi says a leaked document shows that hotel and transport companies, as well as Muslim clerics and human rights organisations, risk having their bank accounts frozen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Somalis around the world rely heavily on the informal money transfer firms, known as "hawalas", to do business and to send cash to relatives because of the almost non-existent banking sector in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There have been a similar crackdown on the companies in the UK and US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A spokesman for the Somali money transfer agencies in Kenya, Abdi Ali, told the BBC they would oppose moves to shut them down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"To us, it is only a ministerial directive which is sent to the central bank. We will talk to the Kenyan government about this issue and use its justice system to settle matter," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The United Nations estimates Somalis in the diaspora send home about $1.6bn ( 1.1bn) annually, significantly more than foreign aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>More than 40% of Somalis receive remittances, the bulk of which are used for basic needs, including food, clothes, medicine and education, according to a UN survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Somalia has not had a functioning government since the fall of Siad Barre's government in 1991, and has been hit by religious and clan conflicts.</td></tr>
