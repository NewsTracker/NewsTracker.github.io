<h3>Mexico officials investigate case of girl wrongly sent to US</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prosecutors have launched an investigation of possible criminal conduct in the case of a 14-year-old girl mistakenly sent to the United States to live with a woman who claimed to be her mother, authorities said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Alondra Luna Nunez was returned to her family in Mexico on Wednesday after DNA testing in the United States showed she was not the long-missing daughter of Houston resident Dorotea Garcia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Prosecutor's Office in the southwestern state of Michoacan said in a statement that it is looking into the case involving a civil court judge in Los Reyes, including media reports and videos "which suggest probable acts against the child's bests interests and could constitute an illegal action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Video footage of Alondra being taken screaming by police circulated widely and attracted national and international attention to the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Alondra had asked for DNA tests in Mexico before she was sent to the United States, and her parents presented more than a dozen documents including her baptismal records, family photographs and a copy of her birth certificate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Judge Cinthia Elodia Mercado ruled that Alondra was in fact Alondra Diaz Garcia, who was taken from Texas by her father in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The other girl remains missing, and the father's whereabouts are also unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Elodia Mercado said this week that it was not within her authority to order DNA testing, and she was obligated to ensure Mexico followed international conventions on child abductions.</td></tr>
