<h3>Michigan State holds off Georgia 70-63 in NCAA East Region (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At others, the Spartans were making mental mistakes and struggling to protect their late lead in a shaky finish that had coach Tom Izzo punching the scorer's table in fury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>''We're an interesting team,'' Izzo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And yet, Michigan State did enough to beat Georgia 70-63 on Friday in the NCAA Tournament's round of 64 behind veterans Denzel Valentine, Travis Trice and Branden Dawson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Valentine scored 16 points, Trice had 15 and Dawson had a strong second half for the seventh-seeded Spartans (24-11), who proved Izzo right when he said Thursday that this team has a ''very small'' margin for error compared to some of its predecessors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Michigan State led by 12 points with about 90 seconds left before Georgia (21-12) rallied to make it a one-possession game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Valentine went 6 for 6 at the free throw line in the final 30 seconds to help Michigan State advance to face No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>2 seed Virginia in Sunday's round of 32 in the East Region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''You saw a lot of good minutes and then you saw some bizarre plays,'' Izzo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I think Georgia deserves some credit for that and we deserve some blame for that but we're doing what you're supposed to do in this tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Spartans showed at least glimpses of the experience from playing in 18 straight NCAA Tournaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was one of their biggest advantages against the 10th-seeded Bulldogs, who were in the field for the first time since 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They led by 13 points at halftime, watched the Bulldogs rally within a basket, then responded with a 19-8 burst that put them back up by double figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They did just enough late to stay in front about a week after blowing an 11-point lead in an overtime loss to Wisconsin in the Big Ten Tournament final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''We've been in this situation before and there's been times where we kind of fell apart and we knew we couldn't do that this time,'' Trice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Charles Mann scored 19 points to lead Georgia, which rallied within 66-63 on Kenny Gaines' three-point play with 20.9 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Valentine hit the third and fourth of his late free throws to make it a two-possession game again, then Mann missed a drive to set up Valentine's final free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''They played like a team that's been here before,'' said Georgia's Marcus Thornton, who had 12 points while battling second-half foul trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''So when you're playing against a team like that, there's only a very limited margin for error.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Georgia: The Bulldogs made 7 of 25 shots (28 percent) before halftime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>... The Bulldogs shot 33 percent for the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>... Georgia took a 43-35 rebounding advantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>... Charles Johnson, a defensive end with the Carolina Panthers here in Charlotte, attended the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He played at Georgia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Michigan State: Outside of Valentine's 6-for-6 day at the line, the rest of the Spartans hit 5 of 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>... Michigan State made 7 of 18 3-point tries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>... Bryn Forbes added 14 points, including a four-point play for a 58-45 lead with 7:16 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>... Former Spartans great Magic Johnson sat a few rows behind the Michigan State bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Dawson had a quiet first half with two fouls, but had all of his 14 points and six rebounds after halftime - including consecutive three-point plays shortly after Georgia's 10-0 run cut Michigan State's lead to 39-37.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Gaines, Georgia's No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>2 scorer and top perimeter defender, finished with 15 points, including two 3-pointers, despite playing with a sprained left foot that sidelined him for the regular-season finale and the Southeastern Conference Tournament semifinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''There's no way to get him 100 percent right now,'' Georgia coach Mark Fox said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''I thought under the circumstances, it's very hard to play this game when you don't practice, extremely hard to maintain your conditioning, your timing, and everything else that you need to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Georgia: season is complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Michigan State: will play Virginia on Sunday.</td></tr>

<h3>Feds open investigation into Aaron Schock</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Aaron Schock's spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Associated Press reports that the government is convening a federal grand jury in Springfield, Illinois, and the FBI has begun issuing subpoenas to compel people close to Schock to testify, citing a person familiar with the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The grand jury will hear testimony in early April, according to the AP's report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Schock's resignation is effective Mar. 31, so until then, the Office of Congressional Ethics will continue its investigation into his spending habits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Schock abruptly announced his resignation from Congress on Tuesday with a statement that said that "the constant questions over the last six weeks have proven a great distraction that has made it too difficult for me to serve the people of the 18th District with the high standards that they deserve and which I have set for myself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Schock did not inform or consult his party's leadership about his decision to resign before it was announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>At 33 years old, Schock was among the youngest members of Congress, and he was once considered a rising star in the Republican Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He had been an able fundraiser, and he cultivated an active social media presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His Instagram account, for example, chronicled his adventurous, jet-setting lifestyle, showing the congressman rubbing elbows with celebrities and vacationing in foreign countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But it may have also contributed to a reputation for extravagance, inviting the scrutiny that ultimately prompted his resignation from Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last month, the Washington Post was given a look at Schock's new office, which was painted a bright red, festooned with gilded knick-knacks, and reportedly inspired by the British period drama "Downton Abbey."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Post reported that Schock received the design services for free, prompting a left-leaning ethics watchdog to file a complaint alleging an improper receipt of gifts by a public official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Later that month, the same watchdog group filed a complaint against Schock after it was reported that he spent taxpayer and campaign money on private air travel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An Associated Press review found that Schock spent more than $40,000 on at least a dozen flights onboard private aircraft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The congressman also came under scrutiny after a report found that he'd sold his home in Peoria, Illinois, to a donor at a price far above the market value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He also faced questions about his purchase and use of a vehicle in his home district.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Schock bought a Chevrolet Tahoe in 2010, logging just over 81,000 miles on it before he sold it in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He was reimbursed by the government and his campaign for over 170,000 miles driven, however, and his resignation came just hours after Politico asked his office about the roughly 90,000-mile discrepancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In 2014, when Schock sold his old Tahoe, he spent almost $75,000 of his campaign funds on a new Tahoe that he registered in his name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>CBS News Producer Andres Triay contributed to this report.</td></tr>
