<h3>Yahoo launches Livetext messaging app</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yahoo's unveiled a messaging app to take on the likes of Snapchat, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Livetext will allow users to exchange live video, text and emoticons, but without audio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The app is available now for Apple and Android devices in the UK, US, Canada, Germany and France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We wanted to find that new and expressive way of communicating," said Adam Cahan from Yahoo at a New York media event to launch the app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yahoo says video calls can be better than texts for expressing emotions, but their audio component makes private conversations public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With Livetext, you message friends by typing, just like texting, but you see video of friends without the audio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cahan said the Yahoo team chose to focus on video without audio to encourage people to use the app in different situations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said that they'd found with audio, in many situations, people "aren't willing to engage".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At the event, product manager Arjun Sethi demonstrated "conversations" over smartphone connections that showed live facial expressions along with text and emoticons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We see video as a way to make your conversations more authentic, and we see text as a way to connect that's quick and non-intrusive," Sethi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The move comes with Yahoo aiming to refocus its business on mobile and video after losing leadership in web browser search.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The tech industry already has a number of messaging apps ranging from Facebook-owned WhatsApp to Snapchat, which features disappearing video messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Every platform shift leads to new forms of communication, driven by our desire to connect and interact in richer ways," Cahan said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We wanted to create a new way to communicate, blending the simplicity of texting with the emotion and immediacy of live video, to make your experience spontaneous and real."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The app was tested in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Ireland, as well as some US college campuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It's the latest example of Yahoo trying to catch up in mobile services since Marissa Mayer became the company's CEO three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Arjun Sethi came to Yahoo from the mobile messaging app MessageMe, bought by Yahoo last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yahoo!</td></tr>
