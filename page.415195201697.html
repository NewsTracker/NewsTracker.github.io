<h3>After Benjamin Netanyahu warnings, US and Iran resume nuclear talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Montreux, Switzerland: The US and Iranian foreign ministers began a third day of talks over Iran's nuclear program on Wednesday, just hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had warned that the deal being negotiated was a serious mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>US Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran's Mohammad Javad Zarif resumed their discussions in the Swiss lakeside town of Montreux, hoping to work out a framework deal by late March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, Mr Netanyahu's controversial speech to the US Congress on Tuesday, where he harshly criticised the diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute, will make it harder for the Obama administration to sell the potential deal back home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The US Secretary of State walks to a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister in Montreux.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Netanyahu argued that rather than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear arms, a deal would "all but guarantee" that it would one day get the atomic bomb, putting Israel, the wider region and US interests at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>US President Barack Obama responded within hours, saying Mr Netanyahu had offered no "viable alternatives" to the current course of negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Iran and world powers are trying to put a framework agreement in place by the end of the month, despite the misgivings of Israel, US congressional Republicans and some Gulf Arab states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Such an accord would be followed by a comprehensive agreement to be completed by the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The aim of the negotiations is to persuade Iran to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions that have crippled the oil exporter's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The United States and some of its allies, notably Israel, suspect Iran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover to develop a nuclear weapons capability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Iran denies this, saying it is for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity.</td></tr>

<h3>Frustrated Manly CEO pulls DCE contract</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The future of Cherry-Evans has been one of the biggest talking points in the off-season and Manly CEO Joe Kelly made the decision after becoming frustrated at the 26-year-old's failure to let the club know his intentions by the agreed deadline of 12pm on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cherry-Evans has publicly courted other clubs with a TV crew filming his arrival at Sharkies Leagues club for talks with Cronulla and he and his wife were then photographed looking at property around the Gold Coast last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's believed these actions upset the Sea Eagles' playing group and Kelly said the offer, believed to be $900,000 a season, was withdrawn as the contract talks were overshadowing preparations for Friday's round one opener against Parramatta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We've been talking about this for three-and-half months now and we set him a deadline of midday on Monday and that has come and gone," Kelly told AAP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"At the end of the day we've offered Daly what we consider a very good deal. But the reality is that we have a big game on Friday and we want to focus fully on that and this is affecting our preparations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Five-eighth Kieran Foran is also yet to rubber-stamp an offer from the club but Kelly refused to say if that deal for the Kiwi international, who is wanted by Parramatta, is still on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We just want to focus on the game and that is all we want to say about the matter for now," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The season is about to start and that is the most important thing at this club."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Manly coach Geoff Toovey admitted he was surprised at the news as he was confident Cherry-Evans would remain at Brookvale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was still hopeful Foran will stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We think it's in their best interests to remain at the Manly club," Toovey told Fox Sports 365 show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We think we made an offer that was very good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I don't think (news of Cherry-Evans) is a worry. He has taken his time to make a decision but I think the right decision would have been to stay at the club."</td></tr>
