<h3>Sport24.co.za | Parling recalled in England team</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Parling comes into the second row in place of Dave Attwood, who drops out of the squad, in the only change to the team that overcame Scotland 25-13 last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Harlequins number eight Nick Easter returns to the bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Geoff did well off the bench against Scotland and now that he has got some games under his belt we feel it is the right time to start him and use his experience and quality in the starting line-up," Lancaster said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The same goes for Nick Easter, who has really impressed in camp and in his appearances off the bench. Nick is a quality ball-carrier and great defender - things we feel we'll need in the latter stages of the game."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Seeking a first Championship success since 2011, England go into the final weekend level on points with Ireland and Wales at the top of the table, but with a points difference advantage of +4 and +25 over their respective pursuers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Wales play away to Italy on Saturday, while Ireland tackle Scotland in Edinburgh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Finishing off the tournament at home is going to be a great occasion," Lancaster added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The support against Scotland last week was fantastic and this weekend we really need the crowd to get behind the team and drive them forward in what will be an exciting finale to this year's Championship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Parling's selection is the reward for a powerful 30-minute cameo from the bench against Scotland and will see the British and Irish Lion replace Courtney Lawes in running the line-out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Attwood misses out despite having started in all four matches of the tournament so far, with 36-year-old Easter's experience giving him the edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tighthead prop Dan Cole will win his 50th cap and Lancaster said: "It's a great achievement for Dan to win his 50th cap, especially coming back from his injury last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He is one of the cornerstones of our squad and we all wish him all the best."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>England: 15 Mike Brown, 14 Anthony Watson, 13 Jonathan Joseph, 12 Luther Burrell, 11 Jack Nowell, 10 George Ford, 9 Ben Youngs, 8 Billy Vunipola, 7 Chris Robshaw (captain), 6 James Haskell, 5 Courtney Lawes, 4 Geoff Parling, 3 Dan Cole, 2 Dylan Hartley, 1 Joe Marler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Substitutes: 16 Tom Youngs, 17 Mako Vunipola, 18 Kieran Brookes, 19 Nick Easter, 20 Tom Wood, 21 Richard Wigglesworth, 22 Danny Cipriani, 23 Billy Twelvetrees.</td></tr>

<h3>Barcelona aims for decisive blow against Real Madrid</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Barcelona is on a run of 17 wins in its last 18 games and leads the league by one point, while Madrid is a shadow of the side that ended 2014 on a Spanish record 22-match winning streak that included a 3-1 win over the Catalan club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Regardless of the teams' contrasting form, one constant will remain: Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will again vie to leave their mark on one of the most hotly contested rivalries in soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We face the match with a lot of respect," Messi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Madrid never plays poorly and when they appear to be struggling, they are even more dangerous. They have incredibly talented players, and we have to respect then more than ever."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Barcelona appeared to be on the brink of a breakdown following a loss at Real Sociedad in early January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That was followed by a chaotic week that included the firing of its sport director and president Josep Bartomeu calling for early elections in the offseason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The team has responded in incredible fashion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Barcelona has reached the final of the Copa del Rey, the quarterfinals of the Champions League, and has passed Madrid in the league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Madrid has gone the other way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Injuries and tougher competition have transformed the once invincible European champions into a vulnerable side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The team has nine wins, two draws and five losses since the winter break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Madrid will arrive at Camp Nou the better rested team after not having played since last Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Barcelona remains on a high after a second convincing victory over Manchester City on Wednesday, when it eased into the Champions League quarterfinals for a record eighth straight season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We are strengthened by the win (over City)," Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We have the important advantage of playing at home, but in many cases that isn't decisive. To talk about being favorites is risky and pretentious."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There is no secret to Barcelona's success: Messi is back to playing at a level reminiscent of his best days under former coach Pep Guardiola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Luis Enrique has moved Messi back to his original position on the right side of Barcelona's attack, and Messi is flourishing both as a scorer and in his newfound role as the team's best passer and playmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Not surprisingly, Madrid's troubles coincide with a dip in form from Ronaldo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ronaldo once held a big lead over Messi in goals scored in the league, 23-13 through 15 matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Messi has since gone on a scoring streak with 19 goals in the last 12 games, while Ronaldo has notched five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Messi now leads Ronaldo 32-30 in the league and 43-41 overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The game may well be decided in the midfield, where Madrid has finally managed to match Barcelona by bringing in strong passers like Toni Kroos and Francisco "Isco" Alarcon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Madrid will be without James Rodriguez with a broken foot, while Javier Mascherano should seamlessly fill in for Barcelona in place of injured stopper Sergio Busquets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The question then for Luis Enrique is whether to play Jeremy Mathieu or Marca Bartra alongside Gerard Pique in defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>With all eyes on the clasico, third-place Valencia will try to gain ground on the top two when it visits Elche on Friday trailing Madrid by seven points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Defending champion Atletico Madrid is a point behind Valencia and hosts Getafe on Saturday, while Sevilla visits Villarreal in a meeting of the league's fifth- and sixth-place sides on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Manchester City's Yaya Toure, right, challenges Barcelona's Lionel Messi, left, during a Champions League round of 16 second leg, soccer match between FC Barcelona and Manchester City at Camp Nou stadium, in Barcelona, Spain, Wednesday, March 18, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo from Portugal reacts during a La Liga soccer match between Real Madrid and Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain, Sunday, March 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo from Portugal, fails as he jumps trying to kick the ball during a Spanish La Liga soccer match between Real Madrid and Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain, Sunday, March 15, 2015.</td></tr>
