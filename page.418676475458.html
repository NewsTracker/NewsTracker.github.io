<h3>Nigeria's new president visits Obama at White House to discuss Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nigeria is looking for U.S. assistance in combating Boko Haram, but the United States refuses to sell the country weapons because of concerns over the Nigerian army's human rights record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Buhari is also expected to look for help from the United States to recover billions of dollars apparently stolen by former Nigerian officials, but evidence that the money was stolen must first be delivered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Corruption will also be on the agenda during Buhari's four-day visit, as he campaigned on ridding the country of illicit behavior by officials.</td></tr>
