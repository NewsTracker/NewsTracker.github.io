<h3>Google's New Self-Driving Cars Cruising Silicon Valley Roads</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The latest models of Google's self-driving cars are now cruising the streets near the Internet company's Silicon Valley headquarters in a test of how they work around other vehicles driven by people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's the first time that the pod-like, two-seat vehicles have been allowed on public roads since Google unveiled the next generation of its self-driving fleet more than a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google had previously installed its robotic driving technology in Lexus vehicles in the first few years of its ambitious project before developing the smaller prototype.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new models are designed to work without a steering wheel or brake pedal, although the vehicles that began driving Thursday in Mountain View, California, are equipped with these features.</td></tr>
