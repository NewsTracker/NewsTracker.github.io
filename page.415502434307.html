<h3>Abandoned dog Hero saves lives of 10 puppies and their mother in Texas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Labrador mix, who has since been named Hero, had spent weeks eluding members of Dallas Dogrrr-Rescue, Rehab, Reform in Texas, who were trying to rescue him from a south Dallas park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But on Tuesday night, he greeted rescuer Marina Tarashevsce and dog behaviorist John Miller with persistent barking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Every time the pair moved closer to him, Hero inched backward and barked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Deciding that the dog was trying to alert them to something, Ms Tarahevsce and Mr Miller followed him into nearby woodland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A short while later, they came across a burnt-out tree, situated by a creek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Incredibly, under the tree, the rescuers discovered a litter of ten, shivering puppies - one of which had nearly frozen to death in the cold - and their exhausted mother, who has since been named Mona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Five days on, the 11 rescued animals have been transferred to a warm and caring foster home, Fox News reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They have been joined by Hero himself, who remains constantly by their side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>According to Dogrrr-Rescue, Hero may be the puppies'' father, although this is not confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But regardless, he will undoubtedly be 'the most loving and nurturing dog dad', the group remarked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Speaking to 'Fox and Friends Weekend' on Sunday, Ms Tarashevsce said she and Mr Miller were greeted by a 'loud barking' when they walked across the park to retrieve black-furred Hero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>'When I got there in the evening, Hero was barking really loudly,' she told the program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'And it wasn't just a regular bark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ms Tarashevsce said that she had often seen Hero with Mona, whom she suspected to be pregnant, in recent weeks, so she assumed that something must be wrong with the expectant mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Saving animals' lives: 'When I got there in the evening, Hero was barking really loudly,' Ms Tarashevse (pictured, right, with Hero before their TV appearance) told the program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'I had suspected that she was pregnant, so that's why I followed him... He led us to a creek by the woods,' she said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>The rescue worker, who is also an animal rights activist, added: 'I still can't believe it, that he actually led me to the puppies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Miller, who is an expert in dogs' behavior, had apparently known straight away the pair needed to follow Hero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He determined that the Lab's barking and movements meant he wanted them to come.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>This week, Dogrrr-Rescue has posted many photos of Hero, Mona and the 10 puppies on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In one image, Hero is pictured standing behind a vet named Dr Hamlin as he examines Mona's leg.</td></tr>
