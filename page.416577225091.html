<tr><td>10</td><td>Meanwhile, the Indonesian government has appointed two Indonesian spiritual counsellors to be with Sukumaran and Andrew Chan in their final hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In what Chan's brother Michael described as "the last bit of dignity denied," the Attorney-General's office denied the men their choice of religious guide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This is despite reassuring the Australian embassy two days earlier that they would be permitted to choose who would witness their deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Paintings by Myuran Sukumaran, and signed by all nine awaiting execution are displayed by Sukumaran's family at Wijaya Pura in Cilacap on the day of the execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chan had chosen Salvation Army Minister and old family friend David Soper, who presided at his and Febyanti Herewila's wedding, and Sukumaran had asked for Bayside Church pastor Christie Buckingham.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>However the Indonesian authorities have appointed pastor Tuhu Santoso for Sukumaran, and they have yet to allocate a pastor for Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Pastor Karina De Vega was supposed to be with Chan for the execution, but has been reassigned to Nigerian Okwudili Oyatanze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Paintings by Myuran Sukumaran have been signed by all nine awaiting execution.</td></tr>

<tr><td>21</td><td>Muslim cleric Hasan Makirim, who attended the executions of Namaona Denis from Malawi and Rani Adriani from Indonesia on January 18, told Fairfax Media in January that it is always easier when a religious counsellor already has a relationship with the condemned prisoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The bodies of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be returned to Australia following their execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Because of that the person can go into the isolation room calmer," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>To offer succour through someone's last days and at the moment of death requires enormous mental preparation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I pray before the execution, on the execution day and when I have to see the convict for the last time. I say a lot of prayers at the mosque because I need strength to do my job," Hasan said in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I pray the person I have to meet can also be strengthened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Tony Spontana, spokesman for the Attorney-General, said the bodies of Chan and Sukumaran would be flown back to Australia after being driven to Jakarta in an ambulance.</td></tr>
