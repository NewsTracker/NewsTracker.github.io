<tr><td>8</td><td>He surrendered to Turkish officials in Turkey on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He voluntarily flew back to Australia with a police escort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Brookman, a Muslim convert and father of five children who live in Melbourne, told Fairfax Media in May that he went to Syria last year to do humanitarian work for civilians caught in the war.</td></tr>
