<h3>Federal Court in Alabama Is Asked to Clear Way for Same-Sex Marriages</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The motion, filed with Judge Callie V.S. Granade of United States District Court, could trigger the next salvo in a showdown between state and federal judiciaries over same-sex marriage in one of the nation's most conservative states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In its ruling Tuesday, the Alabama high court ruled that state law "allows for 'marriage' between only one man and one woman.'' It came after a 22-day period in which gay and lesbian people could marry in some localities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The opening had been made possible by two rulings Judge Granade issued in late January that declared Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Those rulings came in two cases in which same-sex couples challenged Alabama's marriage restrictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But opponents of same-sex marriage, including Chief Justice Roy Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court, have argued that Judge Granade's rulings do not apply to the state's probate judges - the local officials charged with issuing marriage licenses - because the probate judges were not named as defendants in the lawsuits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>(Judge Granade later issued a ruling naming one of the probate judges, Don Davis, of Mobile County).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Chief Justice Moore ordered the probate judges not to issue the licenses on Feb. 8, the day before Judge Granade's rulings were to take effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Amid the confusion, some probate judges issued licenses to gay couples while others did not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After the State Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday, all probate judges stopped issuing licenses to gay couples.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Friday's motion, filed by attorneys for the National Center for Lesbian Rights and other groups, seeks to solve that problem by asking Judge Granade to convert one of the cases into a class-action lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The lawyers are hoping the judge will allow them to name all of the state's probate judges as a defendant class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And the motion asks that all of the same-sex couples wishing to marry in Alabama be named in addition to the four couples who are currently named as plaintiffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It also asks the court to direct the probate judges to "refrain from enforcing all Alabama laws and orders that prohibit same-sex couples from marrying or that deny recognition of the marriages of same-sex couples."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Shannon Minter, the legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said he hoped the court would act quickly "to provide certainty to couples throughout the state and establish once and for all that Alabama's same-sex couples have the freedom to marry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The State Supreme Court's ruling came after two conservative groups, the Alabama Policy Institute and the Alabama Citizens Action Program, filed a petition to stop gay marriage in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An attorney for the groups could not be reached for comment on Friday, nor could the president of the state probate judges' association.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2015, on page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Alabama: Groups Seek to Reinstate Gay Marriages.</td></tr>

<h3>Islamic State expelled from Iraq town Al-Baghdadi: US</h3>
