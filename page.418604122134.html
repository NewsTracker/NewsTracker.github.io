<h3>Big weekend arrives for Favre, joining Packers Hall of Fame (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The great thaw is nearly complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The big weekend in Green Bay is finally here for Brett Favre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The former quarterback renowned for his durability and gunslinger mentality will be inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame and have his No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>4 jersey retired on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's a day some Packers fans thought they might never see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The sides have mended their relationship after a messy split that stemmed from the ''will he or won't he retire'' drama that led to a once-unthinkable exit from Green Bay in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But Saturday begins a green-and-gold celebration of a storied, 16-year tenure with the Packers that helped revive of one of the NFL's marquee teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''I think it's huge,'' Mike McCarthy, Favre's last coach with the Packers, said during minicamp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''There (are) some monumental moments for this organization and obviously he has quite a few of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With the kind of fanfare befitting for a player who had a flair for the dramatic, both on and off the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The induction ceremony for old No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>4 will take place in the Lambeau Field atrium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The roughly 67,000 seats for fans to watch on video boards inside the stadium bowl have long been sold out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tickets, of course, cost $4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Net proceeds were to go to the Favre 4 Hope charity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Now 45, Favre will also participate in a charity flag football game on Sunday at the University of Wisconsin's Camp Randall Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The event will pit former Packers against noted retired NFL players including former Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A scheduling conflict at Lambeau and the game's proximity to training camp, which starts in less than two weeks, prevented the game from being held in Green Bay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Returning to Lambeau for the event might have made the weekend perfect for Favre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Still, this is a moment that he has been looking forward to for some time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''To say a whirlwind would be probably an understatement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It's going to be a lot of fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Much anticipated obviously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Not only from our end but I think from everyone else,'' Favre said earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The rumblings in Titletown began a decade ago after the Packers took Aaron Rodgers in the first round of the 2005 draft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Favre wasn't thrilled that the team had found his heir apparent, and fans initially treated Rodgers with skepticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Rodgers took over in 2008 after Favre was traded to the Jets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Favre retired briefly, then came back with the Minnesota Vikings for a two-year stint starting in 2009 that finally finished his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Any apprehension that Favre might have felt about how fans might react disappeared after the response for tickets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''If there were any questions prior to that about how the fans felt about my return, I think those questions have been answered,'' Favre said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Packers president Mark Murphy said he also initially wasn't sure what kind of turnout to expect on Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''But the fact that it sold out sold quickly tells me the fans are ready,'' Murphy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Another milestone will come on Thanksgiving night, when Favre's number will go up on the stadium's interior facade during the game against the Chicago Bears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Favre threw for nearly 72,000 yards and completed 62 percent of his passes in a 20-year career overall that began after being drafted by Atlanta in the second round in 1991.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In February 1992, under then-new general manager Ron Wolf, Green Bay acquired Favre from the Falcons for a first-round pick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The Packers won the Super Bowl four seasons later, beating New England 35-21.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>They returned to the Super Bowl the following season, losing to Denver 31-24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Renowned for his durability, Favre holds a slew of NFL marks including a QB-record 297 straight regular-season games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He won three MVP awards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>His 16 seasons in Green Bay matched Bart Starr (1956-71) for the longest tenure in team history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''I don't know if there has been a player in recent memory that has been as connected as Favre to the Packers ... How many people have 16 years with one team,'' Murphy said.</td></tr>
