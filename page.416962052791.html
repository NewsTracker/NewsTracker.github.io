<tr><td>3</td><td>BAGHDAD -- Iraq's Defence Ministry said Wednesday an airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition killed a senior Islamic State commander and others near the extremist-held city of Mosul, though the country's Interior Ministry later said it wasn't clear if he even was wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Defence Ministry said the strike killed Abu Alaa al-Afari and others who were in a meeting inside a mosque in the northern city of Tal Afar, 72 kilometres west of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The ministry described al-Afari as a senior deputy to the Islamic State group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</td></tr>
