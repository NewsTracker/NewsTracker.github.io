<h3>Nepal quake toll passes 4000</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nepal's government has declared three days of mourning for the more than 4000 people who died in a massive earthquake at the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The government raised the death toll to 4353, with a further 7953 known to have been injured, as volunteers searched for dead and missing from Saturday's quake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Another 73 people died in India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The toll in China's far western region of Tibet, which neighbours Nepal, rose to 25, the official Xinhua news agency said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Nepal government also said that it was going through "a difficult time in dealing with the crisis, in terms of its limited resources".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We were not prepared for a disaster of this scale," Interior Minister Bam Dev Gautam said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We do not have enough resources and will need more time to reach out to everyone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prime Minister Sushil Koirala told an emergency all-party meeting the government was sending desperately needed tents, water and food supplies to those in need.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But he said getting help to remote Himalayan villages left devastated by Saturday's 7.8-magnitude quake was a "major challenge" in the desperately poor country, where many communities are inaccessible by road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Appeals for rescues are coming in from everywhere," a statement from Koirala's office quoted him as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"But we have been unable to initiate rescue efforts in many areas at the same time due to lack of equipment and rescue experts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Interior spokesman Ministry Laxmi said remote villages in three districts of Sindhupalchowk, Rasuwa, and Gorkha were still inaccessible to relief efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One man staying in a makeshift tent with about 20 people said his home village Sindhukot in Sindhupalchowk district was completely devastated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Three days after the quake hit, rescue teams have still not reached some of the worst-affected areas of Lamjung, the site of the quake's epicentre, around 140 kilometres west of the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The situation here is not good. So many have lost their homes. They don't have enough water or food," said Udav Prasad Timilsina, the head official in the district of Gorkha where Lamjung is located.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We haven't even been able to treat the injured. We are in urgent need of essentials like food, water ... and medicines and tents. Rescuers are coming in, but we need help."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The quake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest which buried part of base camp in a cascade of snow and rock, killing at least 18 people Saturday on the world's highest mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The US State Department confirmed on Monday that two of its citizens were among those killed on the mountain, adding that they were aware of reports that two further Americans had died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop confirmed that an Australian woman also perished on Everest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Rescue helicopters on Monday airlifted climbers from higher altitudes on the mountain where they were stranded above crevasses and icefalls, after evacuating scores of seriously injured from base camp the day before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Pledging $US10 million ($A12.73 million) in relief to help the victims, US Secretary of State John Kerry said he had been shocked by the "gut-wrenching" images of the death and destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Australia said on Tuesday it was raising its aid to $US4.7 million and sending a military plane to bring relief supplies and evacuate its stranded citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But the lack of space at the country's only international airport was hampering efforts to bring in relief by air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Japan's International Co-operation Agency said a disaster relief team was making a third attempt on Tuesday to enter Kathmandu, after being twice turned away from a crowded airport on Monday.</td></tr>
