<h3>Obama holding video talk with European leaders on Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a video conference, Obama and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the EU said they would support and strengthen the role of Europe's OSCE security organization to monitor the so-called Minsk agreements that led to last month's cease-fire between Ukraine's army and Russian-backed separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The "leaders will be ready to decide on further sanctions, if the Minsk agreements are further violated," said the office of European Council President Donald Tusk, who took part in the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fighting has waned substantially in eastern Ukraine in recent days as the cease-fire deal increasingly takes effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But both sides have complained of sporadic violations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The U.N. human rights office on Monday raised its toll of the fighting, saying more than 6,000 people have died since the conflict began in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the wake of the fighting and Moscow's annexation last year of the Crimean Peninsula, the EU has imposed visa bans on 151 individuals, including some senior Russian officials and lawmakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It also has imposed economic sanctions, to which Moscow has retaliated with a ban on most Western food.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Continued support for Ukraine's battered economy was also discussed during the call, which included British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The leaders also expressed "grave concern" over deteriorating security in Libya and agreed to discuss developments again in the future, Tusk's office said.</td></tr>
