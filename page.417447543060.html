<h3>Google still struggling to diversify beyond white, Asian men</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Google's workforce is still dominated by white and Asian men even after the Internet company hired a woman to fill one out of every five of its openings for computer programmers and other high-paying technology jobs last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ongoing lack of diversity emerged in a demographic breakdown that Google released Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Just 18 percent of Google's technology jobs were held by women entering 2015, up a percentage point from the previous year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The rest of them were filled by men who were mostly white or Asian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The latest snapshot of Google's workforce comes roughly a year after Google publicly disclosed the gender and ethnic makeup of its payroll for the first time to cast spotlight on a diversity problem vexing the entire technology industry.</td></tr>
