<h3>Egypt announces plans to build new capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Egypt Economic Development Conference that opened Friday is the government's centerpiece for showing that the country is ready for business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has staked much of his legitimacy on fixing an economy deeply damaged by four years of turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) - Egypt's government announced Friday plans to build a new capital adjacent to Cairo, in a massive new project that in its first phase would cost $45 billion and take up to seven years to complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Housing Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced the plan at the opening of the 3-day international economic conference held in this resort city and attended by hundreds of business executives and world leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The aim, he said, is to alleviate congestion and overpopulation in Cairo over the next 40 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>By that time, Cairo - currently home to nearly 20 million - would have doubled in size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The first phase of the ambitious program, Madbouly said, is an expansion of the current outskirts of the capital to the east, adding an additional 105 kilometers (60 miles) of development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The area would be a new administrative center including government offices, diplomatic missions and housing as well as universities, a technology and innovation park, and 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) of roads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Madbouly did not say what the new administrative center would be named.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The military has already began constructing the road linking Cairo to the new planned administrative heart of the capital, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The ambitious plan is the latest mega project planned by the government, headed by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who elected in June last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The other mega project is the expansion of the Suez Canal and the creation of an industrial zone around it.</td></tr>
