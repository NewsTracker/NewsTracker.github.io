<h3>Jets' Cromartie: Patriots' Brady shouldn't be suspended (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) -- Tom Brady has an unlikely ally in Antonio Cromartie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cromartie, speaking on ESPN's ''First Take'' at Jets training camp Thursday, said fining Brady $25,000 should suffice for punishment because the team also was fined and docked draft picks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Brady has filed a lawsuit against the league after it suspended him and Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld the decision on appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The support from Cromartie was a bit surprising considering he and Brady aren't exactly buddies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cromartie referred to Brady with an expletive, ramping up an already-heated AFC East rivals as the teams prepared to face each other in the playoffs following the 2010 regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apparently, however, the hot topic of Goodell's range of authority is enough to get the Jets and Patriots to see eye to eye off the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cromartie reiterated his comments after practice Thursday, believing a four-game suspension for Brady is out of bounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''If you look at the rules, anything messing with the football, the maximum fine, I think, is $25,000,'' Cromartie said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''It doesn't say you can go out and suspend anybody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The maximum fine is $25,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cromartie did acknowledge that it is the players' own faults for signing a collective bargaining agreement in 2011 that gives Goodell ''the freedom'' to rule on player appeals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''I feel like we did give him a lot of power,'' Cromartie said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''But at the end of the day, when you go through the CBA, there's no changeup saying that he was supposed to have change-of-discipline or anything else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The commissioner has always had the discipline (power).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But I just feel like at this point in time, the discipline that he's put forth, he's stepped outside the rules and made his own rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''If the rules are the rules, you need to keep the rules the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Cromartie is uncertain whether Brady was directly involved in the Patriots deflating footballs last season, but thinks the league is fumbling the matter, regardless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Despite his criticisms of Goodell, Cromartie isn't concerned about the suspension Jets teammate Sheldon Richardson is facing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The defensive lineman was suspended four games on July 2 for violating the league's substance abuse policy, and could be docked more games by the league after he was charged with resisting arrest following a high-speed road race in Missouri in which he was traveling up to 143 mph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''I think everything with Sheldon is going to go the way it needs to go,'' Cromartie declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The reason for his confidence?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''Prayer,'' Cromartie said with a smile.</td></tr>
