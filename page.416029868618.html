<h3>Kenya destroys 2 al Shabaab camps in Somalia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Al Shabaab denied the camps were hit, saying the air force bombs fell on farmland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gunmen from the al-Qaida-aligned group killed 148 people on Thursday when they stormed the Garissa University College campus, some 200 km (120 miles) from the Somali border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jets pounded the camps in the Gedo region on the other side of the border on Sunday, Kenya Defense Forces spokesman David Obonyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Our aerial images show that the camps were completely destroyed," he said, though cloud cover made it difficult to estimate the death toll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The mission was part of efforts to stop al Shabaab fighters from those camps carrying out cross-border raids into Kenya, Obonyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The militant group has killed more than 400 people on Kenyan soil in the last two years, including 67 during a siege at Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in 2013, piling political pressure on President Uhuru Kenyatta that intensified with last week's killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kenya has struggled to stop the flow of militants and weapons across its 700 km (450 mile) border with Somalia, and the violence has also damaged the economy by scaring away tourists and investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sheik Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab's military operations spokesman, told Reuters that none of its camps were damaged in Sunday's raid, and that the fighter jets had instead struck farmland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Kenya has not targeted any of our bases," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The rural Gedo region of Somalia is difficult to reach and reports about the raid could not be verified independently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One of the four gunmen in the Garissa attack was the son of a Kenyan government official from Mandera county, which borders Gedo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Abdirahim Abdullahi, an ethnic Somali, was reported missing by his father after he crossed into Somalia to join al Shabaab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kenyatta said on Saturday the planners and financiers of Islamist attacks were "deeply embedded" within Kenyan society and urged the Muslim community to do more to root out radicalisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the capital Nairobi, where local media have become increasingly critical of what they call a bungled security response to the Garissa attack, dozens of grieving families are still trying to identify bodies at the city's mortuary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Opposition leader Raila Odinga, who was Prime Minister when Kenya sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to battle al Shabaab, said the government should start thinking about pulling out, just as the United States withdrew troops after 18 soldiers were killed in the 1993 Black Hawk Down incident in Mogadishu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The U.S. used to have many soldiers in Somalia but it recalled them. Kenya should also remove its military officers from Somalia," Odinga said on Sunday, according to comments in Monday's edition of Kenya's Standard newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Kenya has so far shown no inclination to pull out of Somalia where its troops, part of an U.N.-backed African Union peacekeeping mission, have wrested swathes of territory from the Islamist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Western diplomats, however, say this loss of territory has not weakened al Shabaab's capacity to carry out one-off guerilla-style attacks in Somalia or abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Garissa was the most deadly attack on Kenyan soil since al-Qaida bombed the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in 1998, killing more than 200 people and wounding thousands.</td></tr>
