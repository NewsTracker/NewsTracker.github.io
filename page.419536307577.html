<h3>Reports that One Direction are to split in March</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One Direction are set to break up in March, according to a report in The Sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The boyband and teen idol sensations - featuring Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan - are set to part company for a year because they want to focus on solo projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A band source told The Sun: "The guys have been together for five years, which is an incredible run for any boyband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They fully deserve to have at least a year to work on their own projects. There is absolutely no bad blood between them and they are all 100 per cent behind the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is definitely not a split and they fully intend to get back together at some time in the future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There is not to be a tour for the band's fifth album and the shock news could mean their last full concert will be at Sheffield's Motorpoint Arena on 31 October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Millions of fans may still get the chance to see their heartthrobs as a string of TV spots and performances which are already pencilled in before the end of the year are still likely to go ahead, it was claimed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The boys are to have a break over the festive period before getting back together to complete their promotional commitments for their record label in February, according to The Sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The plan had been on the cards "with or without Zayn" Malik, who left the group in March, according to an unnamed source who spoke to the tabloid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The source claimed: "Of course they would have preferred that he had stayed in the band, but they would have taken this extended hiatus even if he hadn't left."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It is believed the break and the decision not to tour was rubber-stamped in a meeting in London last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It means they could each take their money-spinning careers on very different journeys in talks that could get under way within weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There is "a lot of interest" in Styles from Hollywood, Tomlinson is "very much in contention to be a judge on X Factor" next year and all of them are now faced with "a massive amount of options", according to the source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It seems that Payne may want to fine-tune his songwriting, producing and DJ skills rather than a solo career, according to the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In March the band spoke out to quash rumours they were set to split up in the wake of Malik's departure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The band vowed to continue as a four-piece after Malik's shock departure, which he said was so he could live like a "normal" 22-year-old.</td></tr>
