<h3>Neanderthals interbred for longer with East Asian humans, DNA reveals</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two new pieces of research have suggested that the ancestors of modern East Asians may have interbred with the now extinct Neanderthals far more than they did in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Analysis of the traces of Neanderthal DNA found in the genomes of modern humans has shown that people in East Asia carry between 15 to 30 per cent more of their DNA than Europeans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Scientists now say there appears to be two distinct occasions when Neanderthal mixed with modern humans in East Asia compared to just one occasion in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This suggests that Neanderthals were able to spread further towards East Asia than was previously thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>An ancient partial skull has provided the earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside Neanderthals and could have interbred 55,000 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Recently discovered in Manot Cave in West Galilee, Israel, the bone sheds new light on our ancient relatives living in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The find challenged previous theories that the two species potentially met 45,000 years ago somewhere in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Modern Europeans have inherited between two and percent of their genes from Neanderthals, meaning the two groups mated at some point in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A recent study also suggested that many modern diseases are actually caused by DNA that we inherited from this now extinct branch of the human evolutionary tree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Almost all of the remains of Neanderthals have been found in southern Europe and western Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They were not thought to have gone much further east than the Altai Mountains in central Asia, on the borders of what are now Russia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the new findings have raised the prospect that Neanderthals lived in the east of the continent and may have clung on there for longer than their European relatives, who died out around 30,000 years ago - we have just yet to find the archaeological evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The research was conducted by two separate teams working at the University of Washington and the University of California, Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Professor Akey and his colleague Benjamin Vernot analysed distinctive patterns in the DNA of 379 modern Europeans and 286 modern East Asians from China and Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They concluded that one theory - that modern Europeans interbred more with populations from Africa to water down the Neanderthal DNA they carried - was unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Instead they found it was more likely that ancestors of the East Asian populations had bred with Neanderthals more than once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Vernot said: 'One thing that complicates these analyses is the fact that humans have been constantly migrating throughout their history - this makes it hard to say exactly where interactions with Neanderthals occurred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>'It's possible, for example, that all of the interbreeding with Neanderthals occurred in the Middle East, before the ancestors of modern non-Africans spread out across Eurasia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'In the model from the paper, the ancestors of all non-Africans interbred with Neanderthals, and then split up into multiple groups that would later become Europeans, East Asians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'Shortly after they split up, the ancestors of East Asians interbred with Neanderthals just a little bit more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'The important thing is that we show that we didn't just meet Neanderthals once in our history - it looks like we met them multiple times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Previous research has led to theories that modern humans first interbred with Neanderthals as they migrated through the Middle East 55,000 years ago before they then moved further into Europe and Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The evidence that a second mixing between the two species took place among East Asian populations implies that this occurred sometime later and further East than the first interbreeding event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Previous research has led to theories that modern humans first interbred with Neantherthals as they migrated through the Middle East 55,000 years ago before they then moved further into Europe and Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Professor Akey says it is also possible that European ancestors bred with another as yet undiscovered species of ancient human that led to the Neanderthal DNA being watered down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>However the second study conducted by Dr Kirk Lohmueller, an evolutionary geneticist at the UCLA, used similar computer models and found that the most likely explanation was that Neanderthals interbred with humans multiple times in Asia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Dr Lohmueller said: 'It's very hard to put these findings into spatial context.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>'The key idea is that there would have to have been some additional interbreeding events involving East Asians, but not Europeans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Dr Simon Underdown, an athropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the findings should profoundly change our view of what Neanderthals were like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>He said: 'It strongly suggests that rather than a one off interbreeding event between humans and Neanderthals around 60,000 years ago there must have been multiple occurrences of humans and Neanderthals having sex and producing offspring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>'This in turn suggests that the boundaries between humans and Neanderthals as different species are increasingly becoming blurred almost to the point of being non-existent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>'This of course has huge significant for those who wrongly claim the neanderthals were less intelligent, didn't have symbolism and couldn't speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>'We can no longer think of Homo sapiens as the 'top dog' who replaced the more primitive hominin species it encountered on the long trip out of Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Professor Chris Stringer, one of the world's leading anthropologists at the Natural History Museum in London, added that our view of Neanderthals had perhaps wrongly become too 'Eurocentric'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He said: 'The common view is that Neanderthals were 'European', because that is where the original and the most famous remains of this species have been discovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>'But we have known since the 1930s that they were in Asia too, and we now have their fossils from sites in countries like Israel, Syria, Iraq and Uzbekistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>'More fragmentary remains have recently been studied in Siberia, and the highest quality Neanderthal genome is from Denisova Cave in the Altai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>'While there have been claims that Neanderthals lingered longest in places like Gibraltar, we only have a poor fix on the dating of their disappearance further East.</td></tr>

<h3>Fighting rages in Ukraine as clock ticks down to truce</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At least 27 civilians and soldiers died in shelling as German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Russia on Friday it risked fresh sanctions if the fighting did not stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With separatists fighting to conquer more territory ahead of the truce and Kiev forces digging in, there were also doubts about whether anyone would observe the midnight Sunday ceasefire vital to the success of the peace roadmap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The fresh fighting came after rebels and Kiev agreed to the wide-ranging plan on Thursday after marathon talks in the Belarussian capital Minsk between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ukraine's deputy defence minister Petro Mekhed accused the rebels of wanting to "raise their flag" over railway hub Debaltseve, scene of the bitterest recent fighting, and strategic port Mariupol ahead of the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Ukraine is expecting an escalation and taking all necessary measures to be able to respond," Mekhed told journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fragile agreement was seen as the best hope of ending the conflict, which has killed at least 5480 people, but scepticism remains high after the collapse of a similar previous peace plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I don't want anyone to have any illusions or to seem like I'm naive - there is still an awful long way to go to peace," Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko told troops near Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Nobody is absolutely certain that the conditions for peace signed in Minsk will be fulfilled."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini hailed the signing of the roadmap as "a first result".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The first step is the ceasefire tomorrow evening and we'll verify that on the ground," she said in Tunis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both sides are supposed to begin pulling back heavy weaponry from along the frontline no later than two day after that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ukraine's military said that fighting remained fiercest around Debaltseve, with rebels firing missiles at the beleaguered railway hub mid-way between the main separatist bastions of Donetsk and Luhansk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>An AFP journalist in the rebel capital of Donetsk said that sporadic missile salvos and dozens of artillery bombardments could be heard around the city early Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The United States, which has said it could supply Ukraine with weapons if the conflict continues, cautiously welcomed the peace accord, but emphasised the work yet to be done in making it stick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The true test of today's accord will be in its full and unambiguous implementation," the White House said, including "restoration of Ukrainian control over its border with Russia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Under the new accord, Kiev will begin retaking control over the approximately 400 kilometres stretch of Russia's border with rebel-held Ukraine, but only after local elections are held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Separatist-held territories will be granted a degree of autonomy to be established through talks, and the right to decide which language they use.</td></tr>
