<h3>Niger army fights Boko Haram for Lake Chad island after attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NIAMEY, April 26 (Reuters) - Niger's army is fighting to recapture an island in Lake Chad after it was seized by hundreds of Boko Haram militants aboard motorised canoes, army sources said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boko Haram, hardline Islamists who want to establish a caliphate in the region, attacked the island of Karamga at dawn on Saturday, their second attempt to capture it since February, army and government sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lake Chad's islands, which lie in dense swampland, are an ideal base for mounting surprise attacks on the countries bordering the lake: Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There were many (Niger soldiers) dead on Saturday, considerably more than in the first attack," said one of the army sources, referring to a battle in February in which seven Niger soldiers died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A second army source said a counter-attack to clear the island of militants was ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Since February, Nigerian forces backed by neighbours Chad, Niger and Cameroon have won back vast swathes of territory from Boko Haram, which previously controlled an area the size of Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The militants, who have killed thousands of people in their six-year insurgency, are thought to be largely hemmed in within north Nigeria's vast Sambisa Forest where the Nigeria military says it is advancing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, on Friday suspected Boko Haram militants crossed over from Cameroon and forced Nigerian troops out of the border town of Marte, one soldier told Reuters, indicating the group still has a reach beyond Sambisa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The island of Karamga is hundreds of kilometres away, suggesting that there is at least one Boko Haram cell further north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Niger suffered a wave of attacks and suicide bombs in its southern border region of Diffa in February and March, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The last known attack was on the town of Bosso on March 30, although there were no casualties on Niger's side.</td></tr>
