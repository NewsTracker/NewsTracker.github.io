<h3>AP source: Chiefs, Houston reach 6-year, $101 million deal (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- The Chiefs and linebacker Justin Houston agreed on a six-year, $101 million contract just hours before the Wednesday afternoon deadline to reach a long-term deal, a person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The person, speaking on condition of anonymity because the contract had not been announced, said Houston will receive $52.5 million in guarantees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That makes the All-Pro's contract not only the richest in Chiefs history but the richest for a linebacker in NFL history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The only defensive player to ever sign for more is defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who signed a six-year, $114 million pact with Miami earlier this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The sides have been trying to work out a contract to keep Houston in Kansas City since last offseason, but they had made little progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Chiefs put the franchise tag on him, which would have been a one-year deal worth about $13.1 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But negotiations picked up with the approaching deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Houston's representatives met with the Chiefs on Tuesday, and enough progress was made that they eventually came to terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Houston was coming off the final year of his rookie contract, a breakout season in which he broke Derrick Thomas's franchise record with 22 sacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He had four alone in a dynamic season-ending performance against San Diego, leaving him a half-sack short of the NFL's single-season record set by Michael Strahan of the New York Giants in 2001.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Those gaudy totals sent Houston to his third consecutive Pro Bowl and earned him first-team All-Pro honors for the first time in his four-year career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sent his asking price for a new contract soaring, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Houston was considered one of the top linebackers in the draft coming out of Georgia, but a failed test for marijuana at the scouting combine caused his stock to slide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Chiefs wound up taking him in the third round, in retrospect a massive bargain - or downright steal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He has only made roughly $3 million over the course of his rookie contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>For that small price, Kansas City got 200 tackles, 48 1/2 sacks and five fumble recoveries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Houston has also grown into one of the leaders in the locker room, helping keep things together when a rash of injuries struck last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Despite losing linebacker Derrick Johnson and tackle Mike DeVito in the opener, the Chiefs still had one of the AFC's top defenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Houston skipped the Chiefs' entire offseason program, including their mandatory minicamp, rather than signing his franchise tender.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But all along, coach Andy Reid expressed optimism that the sides would reach an agreement before the start of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Reid also wasn't concerned about the missed workouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''I think he's working out, absolutely,'' Reid said at the end of offseason work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Fellow linebacker Tamba Hali, who went through a similar negotiation with the Chiefs in 2011, said he had been in touch with Houston throughout the offseason.</td></tr>
