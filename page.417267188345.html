<h3>Orioles pitcher Brian Matusz suspended 8 games, appeals (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) -- Orioles left-hander Brian Matusz was suspended for eight games by Major League Baseball on Monday for having a foreign substance on his arm during a game in Miami.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Matusz immediately appealed and was in uniform for Baltimore's game against the Houston Astros on Monday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He will continue to pitch until his appeal is heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Matusz entered Saturday's game against the Marlins in the 12th inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Miami manager Dan Jennings asked umpire Paul Emmel to inspect Matusz's right arm, and Emmel ejected the pitcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''I went out there and told the pitcher I was going to touch his right forearm,'' Emmel said after the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''That's where he was touching before he went to the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There was no telling when the appeal would be heard, although Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette suspected a date would be set sometime this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Milwaukee Brewers reliever Will Smith was suspended for eight games on Friday for having a foreign substance on his right arm during a game at Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Smith appealed the sentence, and has not yet had a hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''I'm more focused on getting through today, try to win a game, and see what each day brings,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said before Monday's game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''It's completely in their hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I don't know what they're going to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If Matusz is suspended, he cannot be replaced on the 25-man roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Therefore the Orioles will have only 24 players available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Matusz is 1-2 with a 3.18 ERA in 14 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He has limited left-handed batters to a .185 batting average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Showalter said the length of the suspension probably had much to do with the sentence Smith received.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''They're basing it off precedent,'' the manager said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''Each case is different; that's why you have the appeal process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>To make sure it's not just some blanket punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Speaking before Boston faced Minnesota on the road Monday, Red Sox manager John Farrell said pitchers caught using a foreign substance are probably trying to get a better grip on the ball, rather than make it move differently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''I don't think a grip gives you an ability to make the ball do different things,'' said Farrell, a major league pitcher for eight seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''You're looking for feel in the hand, overall command and a grip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>I think even if you ask a hitter, they're not going to say a substance makes the ball do different things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Duquette agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''Pitchers, they're trying to grip the ball so they can make an effective pitch,'' Duquette said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In the wake of what happened to Smith and Matusz, Farrell expressed hope that MLB could do something that would enable pitchers to get a better grip - within the rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''I would like to see an approved substance that pitchers can use,'' he said.</td></tr>
