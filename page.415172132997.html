<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PUCON, Chile - One of South America's most active volcanoes erupted early Tuesday in southern Chile, spewing heavy smoke into the air as lava surged down its slopes, prompting authorities to evacuate thousands of people.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>About 3,500 people have been evacuated so far, including tourists, said Interior and Security Minister Rodrigo Penailillo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Penailillo warned that the eruption was causing numerous rivers in the area to rise as snow along the sides of the volcano began melting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Villarrica is covered by a glacier cap covering some 40 square kilometers (15 square miles) and snow from about 1,500 meters (about 5,000 feet) on up.</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's an unstable volcano, all of its borders are altered," Alvarez added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>President Michelle Bache let arrived in Pucon amid cheers and boos later Tuesday to check on safety preparations, and declared an agricultural emergency to help local farmers.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>Witnesses said Pucon looked like a deserted town at dawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But as the volcanic activity decreased, some local residents had decided to return to their homes, more cars were seen in the streets, and some people had even decided to sunbathe at a nearby lake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>By midday, the community's bus terminals, banks, restaurants and other businesses were operating normally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The eruption "was something beautiful and amazing. We're still a bit shocked but the volcano has calmed down so I'm going to continue with my vacation," Alejandra Paz Bustos, 29, said as she sunbathed at nearby lake Villarrica.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>"There was nervousness, but we haven't seen any panic."</td></tr>
