<h3>Schools still out for Nepal kids</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>While some schools in Nepal are a week away from reopening following two massive earthquakes, there will be no lessons for close to a million students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That's because 25,000 classrooms have been destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Monday marks one month since Nepal was struck by the first major tremor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A second quake hit in mid-May and the overall death toll has climbed to more than 9000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Australian aid worker Sarah Ireland has just returned to Melbourne after several weeks in Kathmandu where Save the Children has been busy setting up tents for use as temporary classrooms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Some schools are set to reopen on May 31.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the quakes have destroyed more than 25,000 classrooms, leaving 870,000 children unable to continue their education for the time being.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Getting kids back to school and hanging out with their friends is an important part of their healing process, Ms Ireland said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Children aren't sleeping at night, they're wetting the bed or they're being violent and disruptive as they are trying to process what they've been through," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The aid group is also helping to train teachers about coping with children's trauma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Meanwhile, Care Australia warns of a race against time to distribute emergency shelter ahead of heavy monsoon rains due in the next few weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A second shipment of Australian relief supplies reached Kathmandu this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Shelter kits for 1000 families are being distributed in Gorkha and Sindhupalchowk districts which were hardest hit by the second quake.</td></tr>
