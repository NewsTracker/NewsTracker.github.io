<h3>Apple Music brings change to streaming, but is it enough?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When Apple launches its Apple Music streaming service at the end of June, it will affect things big and small in the music industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users in more than 100 countries will get to try the $10-per-month service for free for the next three months when it is pushed to their devices with a free upgrade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They'll get unlimited access to tens of millions of songs during the trial, and afterward be required to pay a monthly fee for access, instead of paying for each album or song download.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It'll change the way you experience music forever," CEO Tim Cook promised Monday at Apple's annual conference for software developers, held in San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It could become one more thing that keeps current iPhone and iPad users inside the Apple ecosystem, while enticing others in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Here's a look at some of the major aspects of Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Subscribers will be able to ask Siri, Apple's mobile digital assistant, all sorts of unusual questions about music, and have any of millions of tunes play back in response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Executive Eddy Cue demonstrated a few of them Monday, including asking for a playlist of the top 10 hits in the alternative genre, asking for a song from the soundtrack of the movie "Selma," and even asking for the top song from May 1982.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>(It was Joan Jett & the Blackheart's "I Love Rock 'n' Roll."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Using Siri's artificial intelligence and one's voice could come in handy when working out, going on a jog or driving a car that comes with Apple's Car Play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In modern times, Internet radio has been defined by automated playlist generators like Pandora, Songza and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple is changing that game by bringing back living, breathing DJs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It plans to run "Beats 1," a live 24/7 radio station hosted by DJs including former BBC host Zane Lowe in Los Angeles, New York and London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The service will be free to users with an Apple ID.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It will also offer standard genre-based Internet radio stations, this time with playlists curated by humans, instead of the algorithms that power the soon-to-be-disappearing feature, iTunes Radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Apple is opening a new platform for artists that allows them to release content to fans such as lyrics to an upcoming song, behind-the-scenes video, or even new tracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Any user can access "Connect" through a tab on the Apple Music app, and can follow artists and access their feeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Only subscribers will be able to view, save and like the content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The fact that payment will be required for what might be considered promotional content will be new to subscription services, but could coax super-fans to pay up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Apple touts its human curation so much, it's making you pay for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A new "For You" tab will offer subscribers music suggestions based on artists and genres they say they like, as well as what they actually listen to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A team of music experts is said to be behind every pick.</td></tr>
