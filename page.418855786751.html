<h3>Vladimir Putin says Sepp Blatter deserves Nobel Prize</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sepp Blatter may be one of the most loathed and corrupt figures in all of sports, but don't tell that to Vladamir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In an interview with Swiss broadcaster RTS that aired Monday, Putin said he believes Blatter - the embattled president of FIFA - should be up for a Nobel Prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We all know the situation developing around Mr. Blatter right now. I don't want to go into details, but I don't believe a word about him being involved in corruption personally," Putin said, via Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think people like Mr. Blatter or the heads of big international sporting federations, or the Olympic Games, deserve special recognition. If there is anyone who deserves the Nobel Prize, it's those people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It's possible Putin's opinion has been influenced by the fact that Russia hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and is slated to host the next FIFA World Cup in 2018.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Blatter announced his resignation in June just days after he won a fifth term amid a massive bribery scandal uncovered by U.S. and Swiss authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Later that month, though, Blatter said in a meeting of the FIFA executive committee in Zurich last week that he would remain president until a FIFA Congress is convened on Feb. 26, 2016, when a new president will be elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Blatter has said he will not run for a sixth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fourteen officials, including former FIFA vice presidents Jack Warner and Jeffrey Webb, were indicted in May for their role in the scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Several more, including former FIFA executive committee member Chuck Blazer, have already pleaded guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Blazer, as the Daily News first reported in November, began working as an informant for the FBI and Eastern District of New York proseuctors in 2011, secretly recording his fellow officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Law enforcement has yet to indict Blatter, who continues to deny any wrongdoing.</td></tr>
