<h3>Pro-Ukraine demonstrators in Belarus assail Russian policy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Demonstrators carried a placard reading "Russia is War," a reference to Moscow's support for a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The rally in Minsk was approved by the authorities and police didn't intervene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has forged close economic, political and military ties with Russia, which has supported the ally with cheap energy and other subsidies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 10 million with an iron hand for more than 20 years, drawing Western criticism for his relentless crackdown on dissent and independent media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Belarus' ties with the West have improved recently as Minsk hosted crucial Ukraine peace talks, and Lukashenko has openly criticized some of Moscow's moves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Belarusian leader recently accused Moscow of violating the rules of the Eurasian Economic Union, a newly created alliance of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He warned that Belarus could leave the union if the agreements on forming the alliance aren't observed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich, who unsuccessfully challenged Lukashenko in 2006, said that the rally reflected fears of Russia's intentions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We are seriously worried and are seeing our historic chance only with the European Union," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Inga Shakhnovich, a 19-year old student waving Ukrainian flag, said she fears that Belarus could become Russia's next victim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Ukraine is fighting for our independence too," she said.</td></tr>
