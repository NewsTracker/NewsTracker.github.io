<h3>Apple Pay launches in UK - how and where to use it</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple Pay has launched in the UK, allowing iPhone and Apple Watch users to pay for goods and services as well as travel around London through their devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>From today more than 250,000 shops across the UK, including Waitrose, Boots and Marks & Spencer will accept payment through Apple Pay, alongside Transport for London (TfL) on its Tube, bus and rail networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When paying with an Apple Watch, double tapping the side button triggers your stored cards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Holding the Watch up to the contactless reader makes the payment, and, like on iPhone, it will vibrate and beep to confirm it's gone through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple Pay has been available to customers in the US since last October, after it was unveiled at the launch of the most recent iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple chief executive Tim Cook said more than one million credit cards were registered to the service within three days, which he claimed made it the largest mobile payment system to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Santander, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland customers are among the first to be able to use their accounts with Apple Pay from the launch, while Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland account holders will have to wait until the autumn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>HSBC and First Direct will join later this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Barclays is the only major UK bank not to partner with Apple on the venture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The bank initially told customers shortly after the announcement in early June that Apple Pay was coming to the UK that negotiations with Apple were ongoing, believed to be down to the bank&#x2019;s own ventures into contactless payment through its bPay mobile payment initiative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Barclays has since said support for Apple Pay is coming 'imminently'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Vice president of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey said the system will be able to used to not only buy coffee and other low-price transactions, but full shopping baskets&#x2019; worth of goods following merchants&#x2019; decisions to upgrade their contactless terminals&#x2019; software to accept transactions with a greater value than 20, rising to 30 in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>&#x201c;In America we&#x2019;re not as advanced in using contactless as the UK, we&#x2019;re only transitioning to chip and pin now,&#x201d; she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ms Bailey said the aim of Apple Pay is to replace the traditional wallet, beginning with payments with a focus on ease of use, security and customer privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t store the credit card number on your phone, a new device account number generated by the banks is stored on the phone in our secure element.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There is also a unique dynamic security code is set with every payment, so if the device account number is compromised in any way, it won&#x2019;t work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve designed it so the transactions are just between you, the bank and the merchant, not seen by Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That transaction information never passes through Apple servers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Where can I use Apple pay?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Which banks are supporting Apple Pay at launch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>HSBC and first direct will begin supporting the system later in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Lloyds Bank, M&S Bank and TSB Bank will be added later in the autumn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Open Passbook if you're using an iPhone for set up, or for an iPad go to Settings > Passbook & Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Add a debit or credit card by tapping the plus icon in the upper right hand corner [on iPhone] or select Add Credit or Debit Card on iPad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>If the card you want to register is already linked with your iTunes account, you'll be prompted to enter its security code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>If the card is not associated with the account, you can add it quickly to Passbook using the camera function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>You will be required to add the security code on the card's rear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Select Next to send the information to your bank, which will verify your data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Select Next once more when the bank has approved your information, and you're ready to start using it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>How do I use it on iPhone?</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>To make a payment in-store, simply hold your iPhone to the card reader with your registered finger or thumb resting on the home button and Passbook will automatically launch as it approaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Your phone will then vibrate and make a pinging noise to let you know the payment has been received, and a tick with the legend Done will appear onscreen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>How do I use it on Apple Watch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>You can store different cards on your Apple Watch to those on your iPhone - they are treated as separate devices and can thus be used independently of each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>You register cards to your Apple Watch under the Apple Watch app on the paired iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>To make a payment, double-click the side button to summon up your default card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Then simply hold it to the card reader to make the payment, and it too vibrates and makes a pinging sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>How can I use it on the Tube?</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Using Apple Pay to travel around via TfL is very similar to making an in-store payment - approaching the Oyster card reader with your iPhone and completed fingerprint scan or double-clicked Apple Watch will let you pass through the Oyster gate or onto the bus and make the payment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>How do I change my default card?</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The first card you add to Apple Pay is automatically the default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>To change it, open Settings > Passbook & Apple Pay Select Default Card > select the new card as your preferred default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>How can I make in-app purchases?</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>You can make in-app purchases on Apple Pay using both your iPhone or iPad.</td></tr>
