<h3>Putin accuses US of meddling in FIFA affairs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>If FIFA is guilty of corruption, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, Russia "has nothing to do with it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the United States of meddling in FIFA's affairs on Thursday and hinted that Washington's crackdown on alleged corruption involving international soccer's governing body was part of an attempt to take the 2018 World Cup away from his country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Corruption charges in the U.S. were announced Wednesday against 14 people, with at least two of them holding American citizenship, in the crackdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Seven of the 14 were arrested Wednesday morning in Zurich ahead of a FIFA meeting and Friday's presidential election for the organization, in which Sepp Blatter is expected to win a fifth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In a separate probe, Swiss prosecutors opened criminal proceedings into FIFA's awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Putin said even if "someone has done something wrong," Russia "has nothing to do with it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He then tried to portray the probe as a U.S. attempt to go after dissenters, likening the case to those of whistleblowers Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Our American counterparts, unfortunately, are using the same methods to reach their goals and illegally persecute people. I don't rule out that this is the case in relation to FIFA," Putin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I have no doubt that this is yet another evident attempt to derail Mr. Blatter's re-election as FIFA president. We are aware of the pressure that he was subjected to in relation to Russia holding the 2018 World Cup."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, who is also a FIFA executive committee member and is in Zurich for the governing body's congress and presidential election, said Wednesday that his country welcomes the investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>How safe is 'calm' Sepp Blatter's FIFA seat?</td></tr>
