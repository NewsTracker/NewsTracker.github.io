<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Brown family attorney Anthony Gray, center, speaks as he is flanked by Michael Brown's parents Lesley McSpadden, left, and Michael Brown Sr., right, during a news conference Tuesday, Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>9, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The news conference was held to call for the arrest of Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer responsible for Michael Brown's fatal shooting on Aug. 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>ST. LOUIS - Lawyers for the parents of an unarmed, black 18-year-old who was fatally shot by a white police officer in a St. Louis suburb say they plan to file a civil lawsuit Thursday against the city of Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Attorneys for the family of Michael Brown announced their plans in a statement Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The lawsuit had been expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Attorneys for Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his father, Michael Brown Sr., said at a press conference in early March that a wrongful death lawsuit would be filed "soon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Attorneys said at the time that the lawsuit would also name former Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The statement Wednesday did not mention Wilson, and a spokesman for the law firm said he could not provide any additional information about the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national "Black Lives Matter" movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But the Justice Department last month released a scathing report citing racial bias and profiling in the Ferguson Police Department and a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targets black residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails.</td></tr>
