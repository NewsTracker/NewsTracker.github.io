<h3>Ex-Louisville basketball player cleared of rape charge (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Former University of Louisville star player Chris Jones is hoping to resurrect his basketball career after he was cleared of allegations that he sexually assaulted two women at a party near campus.</td></tr>
