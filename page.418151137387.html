<h3>US stocks plummet as Greece crisis reverberates</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Fears that Greece's troubles could spread through the global financial system shook markets on Monday, driving U.S. stocks to their worst day of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Investors fled from stocks in Europe and the U.S. and retreated to the safety of government bonds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Measures of volatility spiked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In many ways, it looked similar to previous episodes in Europe's long-running debt crisis, except that this time, investors said, they weren't quite as worried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A series of events over the weekend left Greece perilously close to defaulting on its debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece's Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, said his government would hold a referendum on budget proposals made by the country's lenders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>European officials refused to extend the country's bailout program, which expires on Tuesday, the same day it's supposed to make a debt payment to the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Jeff Carbone, a senior partner at Cornerstone Financial Partners, said the real worry isn't so much Greece, a country with an economy roughly the size of Missouri's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's the contagion risk. If Greece goes, who's next? This isn't about Greece; it's what happens next."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 43.85 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,057.64.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Dow Jones industrial average lost 350.33 points, or 2 percent, to 17,596.35, and the Nasdaq composite fell 122.04 points, or 2.4 percent, to 4,958.47.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The losses wiped out all the gains for the Dow and S&P 500 indexes this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In Europe, Germany's DAX lost 3.6 percent while France's CAC-40 lost 3.7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares fell 2 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Greece's stock market was closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Investors bought German and British government bonds, which are seen as safe havens, and sold bonds issued by Greece's government, sending those yields sharply higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We are really looking at a situation where the market doesn't know what the fallout is going to be," said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"But the U.S. market feels that it is relatively contained at this point."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Over the weekend, the European Central Bank refused to extend its emergency support for Greece's banking system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>That prompted the Greek government to close banks and announce limits on withdrawals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Pictures of long lines at bank machines in Athens appeared on television screens around the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Whenever you see any kind of bank line, there is in the back of investors' mind the thought: 'What if it spreads? What if people panic?' " said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"What's going on in Europe, of course it's going to roil markets in the short term," But for U.S. investors, she said, "the long-term impact is not that big of a deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The last time Greece's troubles shook U.S. markets, there were plenty of other problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In 2012, Spain had entered a recession, and the worry was that it was too big of a country to rescue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sputtering U.S. job growth added to the anxiety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That spring, the S&P 500 index lost 9.9 percent within two months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Investors sought safety in U.S. Treasury bonds, driving long-term interest to historic lows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Back then, the fear was that a financial crisis would spread from Greece to the rest of Europe "because these economies were very fragile," Cavanaugh said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The rating agency Standard & Poor's said Monday that it interprets the Greek government's decision to hold a referendum as a sign that it will put "domestic politics over financial and economic stability, commercial debt payments and eurozone membership."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The agency says it now sees a 50-percent chance of Greece dropping the currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>If Greece defaults and switches to a new currency, it's sure to shake global financial markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But the world is unlikely to see anything like the full-blown crisis of 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A few years ago, banks across Europe were loaded down with loans to the Greek government, corporations and banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Things have changed since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Today, the European banks have shed much of their Greek debt and they have significantly increased their capital," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"A Greek default and exit from the euro zone would be devastating to Greece's economy, but no one else's. | The Greek standoff will be disconcerting to financial markets, but only temporarily."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The European Central Bank is also ready to swing into action to prevent a panic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The ECB has already committed to buying 60 billion euros a month in corporate and government bonds to push down interest rates and help the European economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It could buy even more, and flood financial markets with cash, to calm jittery European investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Bond price rose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent from 2.47 percent late Friday, a big move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The euro rose to $1.1242 from $1.1160.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Gold edged up $5.80 to $1,179 an ounce, and silver slipped 7 cents to $15.66 an ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Copper edged up half a cent to $2.64 a pound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Crude oil fell $1.30 to close at $58.33 a barrel in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Brent crude fell $1.25 to close at $62.01 a barrel in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>- Wholesale gasoline fell 1.9 cents to close at $2.030 a gallon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>- Heating oil fell 2.6 cents to close at $1.837 a gallon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>- Natural gas rose 3.2 cents to close at $2.805 per 1,000 cubic feet.</td></tr>
