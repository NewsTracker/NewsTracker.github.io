<h3>Islamic State claims deadly Tunisia museum attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Japanese, Italian, Spanish and British visitors, as well as three Tunisians, were among the victims of the attack, which took place in the heavily guarded parliament compound of a country largely spared the violent aftermath of the Arab Spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Officials did not confirm the militants' claim of responsibility, but said they had identified two gunmen shot dead by security forces after the shootings, which targeted tourist buses visiting the Bardo museum on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The two gunmen were trained at a jihadist camp in Libya, the Tunisian government said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Interior ministry official Rafik Chelli said the two men had been recruited at mosques in Tunisia and travelled to Libya in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cruise liner MSC Cruises said 12 of its passengers, including Colombians, French and a Belgian, were among the dead, while a Spanish couple was found alive on Thursday after hiding all night in the museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The assault -- the most deadly attack involving foreigners in Tunisia since a 2002 suicide bombing in Djerba -- came at a fragile moment for a country just emerging to full democracy after its pioneering popular uprising four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It is heavily reliant on foreign tourists to its beach resorts and desert treks, and the government was about to tackle politically sensitive reforms aimed at boosting economic growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria and is active in Tunisia's chaotic neighbour Libya, praised the two attackers in an audio recording as "knights of the Islamic State" armed with machineguns and bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tunisians make up the one of the largest contingents of foreign fighters in Syria, Iraq and Libya, and their homeland's young democracy, which has cracked down on militancy at home, was a clear potential target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We tell the apostates who sit on the chest of Muslim Tunisia: Wait for the glad tidings of what will harm you, o impure ones, for what you have seen today is the first drop of the rain," the Islamic State audio said in Arabic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The two dead militants were identified as Tunisians, Hatem al-Khashnawi and Yassin al-Abidi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Two local newspapers reported Abidi had spent time in Iraq and Libya, but officials did not confirm that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tunisia's Prime Minister Habib Essid said Abidi had been under surveillance but "not for anything very special".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We have identified them, it is indeed these two terrorists," the premier told French RTL radio earlier on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Their affiliation is not clear at the moment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tunisian authorities said they had arrested four people directly linked to the attack and five others with indirect ties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A security source said two family members of one of the gunmen were among those held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We arrested the father and the sister of the terrorist Hatem Al-Khashnawi in the their home in Sbiba City," the source told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The president's office said the army would be deployed to the streets as part of increased security following the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"After a meeting with the armed forces, the president has decided large cities will be secured by the army," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The number of foreign tourists killed rose to 20 from 17, the health minister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>London said a British woman was among the dead in shootings it called cowardly and despicable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Spain said the woman in the couple who emerged from the museum alive on Thursday was pregnant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"They were hidden this whole time, without daring to make a phone call, probably because they were anxious and scared, as you can imagine," Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Four years after a popular revolt toppled autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has completed its transition to democracy with free elections, a new constitution and compromise politics between secular and Islamist parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But security forces are battling Islamist militants including Ansar al Sharia, which is listed as a terrorist group by Washington, and Okba Ibn Nafaa, a brigade of al Qaeda-affiliated fighters operating in the Chaambi mountains along the Algerian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The fight against these militants may have played a role in prompting the museum attack, said Geoff Porter, security analyst at North Africa Risk Consulting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Increasing pressure on terrorist activities in the Djebel Chaambi region may have squeezed the balloon, with terrorists seeking softer targets with more symbolic impact," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A former commander in Tunisia's Ansar al Sharia was killed last week fighting for Islamic State in Libyan city of Sirte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He had been running training and logistics, security sources said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The United States said it could not confirm Islamic State was responsible but that the attacks were consistent with the group's actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It offered Tunisia counterterrorism help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>An earlier Islamic State news broadcast distributed online also mentioned the Tunis attack, describing the perpetrators as Mujahideen and asking God to receive them as martyrs in paradise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But it did not claim direct responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A social media account linked to Okba Ibn Nafaa brigade also provided details of the attack, without a direct claim of responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But that group has also issued conflicting statements in the past about its position on Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Bardo attack appeared squarely aimed at Tunisia's economy, with tourism accounting for seven percent of gross domestic product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The government estimates that loses this season for the tourism sector would reach $700 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Two German tour operators said they were cancelling trips from Tunisia's beach resorts to Tunis for a few days and Accor, Europe's largest hotel group, said it had tightened security at its two hotels in Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Italy's Costa Cruises, a unit of Carnival Corp CCL.N, cancelled stops in Tunisia.</td></tr>

<h3>Beverly Hills bakery workers say they were paid as little as $2 an hour</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The owners of two French bakeries in Southern California exploited employees who came to the United States from the Philippines on guest worker visas for what they thought would be well-paying jobs, the immigrants allege in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Eleven current and former employees of the L'Amande French Bakery in Beverly Hills and Torrance say the owners promised their pay would be as much as five times what they were earning in the Philippines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But when the first workers arrived in 2012 under a little-known visa program for foreign investors and their employees, that was not the case, they allege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The workers said that for months they were paid as little as $2 an hour to do cleaning and landscaping work at the Rolling Hills Estates home of Ana Moitinho de Almeida and her husband, Goncalo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The workers say they slept on the floor of the laundry room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They say they were also forced to work up to 17-hour days at the bakeries for less than minimum wage and no overtime pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>One worker was paid only $100 for a month's work, according to the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Almeidas are accused of multiple labor violations, as well as human trafficking and retaliation, after several workers who cooperated with a state investigation into wage theft claims were fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Almeidas, who did not respond to requests for comment Thursday morning, were ordered last year by the California Labor Commissioner's office to pay $245,000 in overtime wages to bakery workers, said Julia Bernstein, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Industrial Relations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>March 19, 4:30 p.m.: An earlier version of this post said the California Labor Commissioner's office had ordered the bakery owners to pay more than $250,000 in overtime wages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The amount was $245,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Workers are trapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They're stuck between a rock and a hard place because their status is tied to their employer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Lawyers for the workers blamed the Almeidas as well as the temporary worker visa program they say the couple easily exploited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most temporary foreign workers are not legally allowed to change jobs, even if they are underpaid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Those who speak out about labor violations may face retaliation or be sent home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Workers are trapped," said Nicole Gon Ochi, an attorney with the Los Angeles chapter of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which filed the lawsuit with the law firm Latham & Watkins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"They're stuck between a rock and a hard place because their status is tied to their employer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The 11 Filipino workers came to the U.S. on E-2 visas, which gives immigrants with specialized skills authorization to work for a foreign national who has invested a substantial amount of money in a U.S.-based business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Federal statistics show the number of E-2 visas issued by the State Department has risen sharply in recent years, from 24,033 in fiscal year 2009 to 35,272 four years later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The visas may be renewed indefinitely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But once the workers arrive on U.S. soil, there is little oversight to make sure they are doing specialized work and are being paid what they were promised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>According to the lawsuit, the workers were brought to the U.S. in several groups between 2009 to 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In visa applications at the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines, the Almeidas told State Department officials their workers would be paid at least $2,000 a month and would be employed as managers or specialists at the bakery, according to the complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In reality, some ended up washing dishes or doing construction projects on an apartment complex the couple owned, the lawsuit says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"This is not what I signed up for," said one former worker, Louise Luis, 40, who was told she would be a bakery manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Ana promised me a job that meant enough to save for a good future for me and my family. All I dreamed of was the chance to save and work."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>She said the Almeidas dissuaded the workers from socializing and did not allow them to leave the property without permission during the months they lived at the couple's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>When employees complained about the conditions to the Almeidas, the couple said each worker owed them $11,000 for the cost of their visas and airfare, according to the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>They told employees they would have to work for at least three years to repay the debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Almeidas also threatened to have the workers deported if they cooperated with the state investigation, according to the complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>If the workers aren't granted protected status, they will have to go home.</td></tr>
