<h3>Jennifer Aniston Calls Herself a Hair Chemistry Junkie</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sure, the actress was amazing as Rachel on Friends, but it was&#xA0;&#x201C;The Rachel&#x201D; that people still talk about today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And while she moved on from the famous character years ago, claiming back her mane as her own, the 46-year-old&#x2019;s golden locks still inspire so it&#x2019;s a logical fit that she&#x2019;s the face and co-owner of Living Proof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Since her sitcom days, haircare brands have been vying for Aniston to use her powerful influence to sway the prosperous beauty industry in one way or another, but being business-savvy and choosing projects based on passion not dollar signs directed her to the MIT scientists behind the young company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Yahoo Style: Can you reveal your secrets to having perfect hair?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jennifer Aniston: Well, that&#x2019;s questionable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When I&#x2019;m not working it&#x2019;s about doing as little as possible to my hair, which allows it to be healthy and not beaten up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And if it&#x2019;s a shampoo day, depending on what the weather is and what my hair&#x2019;s requiring, I&#x2019;ll use either the No-Frizz or the Restore,&#xA0;let it dry naturally and it&#x2019;s really easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I usually just do a little finger drying around the front to open it up and saddle down those cowlicks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>YS: How many times do you shampoo your hair a week?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>JA:&#xA0;About 2 to 3 times a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chris McMillan&#x2019;s [her longtime hairstylist (she even posed topless on the cover of Allure with him]) thing is don&#x2019;t wash your hair every day because it damages it when you have to style it and dry it, and it strips the hair of all its natural oils.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>I actually have been able to go longer with Living Proof because they&#x2019;ve been able to figure out a molecule [OFPMA] that replaces silicone, which is an unbelievable game changer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>YS: Have you been doing no-poo for a while now?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>JA:&#xA0;I would say since I started using the products I don&#x2019;t have to do it everyday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It&#x2019;s so nice and it really does save your hair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>YS: How have you learned so much about hair?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>JA: You know I&#x2019;ve been approached by a lot of different hair companies over the years and it just never felt right, and when I met these guys I was so fascinated by how the product was developed at MIT and the scientists and what they did to break it down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And so when they said would you come on as part-owner I was like, &#x2018;Yea!&#x2019; So I&#x2019;ve had the good fortune to go to Boston and go into the lab and really sort of understand all the ins and outs of what these products are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I&#x2019;m just a junky for that sort of stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>YS: It must be really interesting as a businesswoman who&#x2019;s done amazing well in one industry to really dive into another one and learn something completely new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>JA:&#xA0;It feels sort of organic, you know, actresses and their hair, you&#x2019;re on location, and you&#x2019;re shooting, and how do you take care of your hair, and it kind of felt right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And I really believe in them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It&#x2019;s such a young company, they&#x2019;re excited, and I love being a part of something that&#x2019;s sort of on the ground level being built up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>YS: If you could dye your hair for one color one day, something totally crazy, what would it be?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>JA:&#xA0;I would try platinum for a day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Or just do a wig.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>YS: Do you ever wear wigs?</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>JA: Yeah!</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>I love wigs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The last couple of movies, the last three in a row, I wore wigs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>There&#x2019;s a lot of benefits to a wig.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>You can throw your hair up into a beautiful Restore Mask and leave it on underneath and then your own hair is completely protected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Also you have the ability to change your look without damaging your hair, without cutting it or coloring it.</td></tr>
