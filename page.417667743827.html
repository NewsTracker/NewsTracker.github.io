<h3>Baltimore prosecutors had asked police to target Freddie Gray corner: report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baltimore state attorney Marilyn Mosby speaks in Baltimore, Maryland May 1, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Baltimore prosecutors had asked police to focus drug enforcement efforts on the corner where Freddie Gray was chased by officers before he allegedly suffered a fatal injury in police custody, the Baltimore Sun reported on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The request from State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby came about three weeks before Gray, a 25-year-old black man, was arrested on April 12, according to a court filing by defense attorneys for six officers Mosby has charged in Gray's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mosby's request means she should be removed from the high-profile case, the Sun quoted the motion in Baltimore City Circuit Court as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gray died on April 19 from an injured spine a week after being chased from a west Baltimore street corner by three officers who found a knife on him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His death sparked widespread protests and rioting that prompted a curfew and the calling in of National Guard troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The defense motion quotes a police email that said Mosby's office had asked a police division chief to concentrate drug enforcement efforts on the corner from which Gray fled, the Sun said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mosby's office has dismissed previous defense calls for her removal from the case, including some based on conflict-of-interest allegations stemming from her husband's post as a city councilman in the district where Gray was arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A spokeswoman for Mosby's office had no immediate response to a request for comment.</td></tr>
