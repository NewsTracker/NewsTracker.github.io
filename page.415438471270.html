<h3>Children rescued from Boko Haram so traumatised they have forgotten their names</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nairobi, Kenya: After years in a Boko Haram camp, the children had forgotten their native language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They couldn't even remember their names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They just stared past Christopher Fomunyoh when he tried to engage them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was a rare glimpse at the human toll left by the extremists who have been fighting to create an Islamic state in Nigeria and surrounding areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Fomunyoh, regional director at the Washington-based National Democratic Institute, visited the children recently at an orphanage in the city of Maroua in northern Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They had been rescued by the country's military in November from a squalid Boko Haram encampment near the border with Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This is what he saw: 100 children, aged 5 to 17, without shoes in an orphanage built for 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hard benches for sleeping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A shortage of rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Boys who appeared to be speaking broken Arabic, rather than one of the many languages native to Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Boko Haram is now under siege by Nigerian and other African troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>If the insurgents are pushed back, hundreds more children like these could soon be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But what condition will they be in?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Fomunyoh and others working with the newly rescued children were left to unravel the mystery of what happened to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Were they fighters or merely students?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>How long had they been captive?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>How had they forgotten their names?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Where were their parents?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Right now, there's not full comprehension of the damage of this crisis," said Mr Fomunyoh, who is trying to provide assistance to the children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Even if kinetic operations were to end soon and Boko Haram was taken off the battlefield, it would take years to really address consequences in humanitarian terms."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In April 2014, Boko Haram grabbed the world's attention when fighters abducted 200 schoolgirls in northern Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But it wasn't the first time the group conducted a mass kidnapping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The rate and scale of the group's abductions have increased steadily since 2013, according to a report from the US-based Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Many of the victims have been raped, and only a few have escaped, activists say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The group "forcibly converts the Christian women and girls they capture to Islam and often coerces them and other female abductees into marriage", Watchlist's 2014 report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>According to Human Rights Watch, Boko Haram has allegedly recruited boys as young as 12 to fight for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Still, Mr Fomunyoh wasn't prepared for what he saw.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>And he worried about what would come next for the children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Retreating Boko Haram leaves mass of throat-slit...</td></tr>
