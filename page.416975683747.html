<tr><td>41</td><td>But, after leading a furious comeback that came up just short in Game 3, Muscala has become a key member of Atlanta's rotation off the bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>He scored Atlanta first eight points of the second quarter, and had three rebounds in nearly 15 1-2 minutes.</td></tr>
