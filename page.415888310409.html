<h3>Ten-man Belgium defeats Israel 1-0 in Euro 2016 qualifier</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) " Ten-man Belgium held on to beat Israel 1-0 in a 2016 European Championship qualifier on Tuesday after Marouane Fellaini scored an early goal and captain Vincent Kompany was sent off midway through the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fellaini scored from close range in the ninth minute to earn a victory that put the Belgians top of Group B, ahead of Wales on goal difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the victory did not come easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kompany was sent off for a second yellow card in the 64th minute and his teammates had to fend off repeated Israeli attacks in the final minutes, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois making some important saves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We definitely did not deserve to lose today," Israel coach Eli Guttman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is the type of Israel team that I wanted to see. We saw an Israel team that battled and played modern football. It's a pity we did not get something from the game."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After a disappointing 3-0 loss to Wales on Saturday, Guttman said he was pleased with the team's performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I saw we did not give up on the game for one moment. I saw that after Kompany was sent off we took control of the game, but they have a great goalkeeper in Courtois," Guttman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Israel made a bright start, with Kompany having to stop a Ben Sahar shot in the first minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Belgium soon took control, and in the ninth minute, Roma striker Radja Nainngolan tried a long-range shot that fell for Kompany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The captain's effort was blocked, only for the loose ball to be steered home by Fellaini.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The visitors remained in control throughout the first half and into the second until Kompany received his second yellow for a foul on Eran Zahavi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>From then on Israel piled on the pressure, with Courtois saving a Sahar shot in the 74th minute and captain Tal Ben Haim going close in the 81st.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But the Belgians held on to secure victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's too bad because we deserved at least a draw from this game," Sahar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"But it gives us confidence for the upcoming games. We have now lost two games but we played against two excellent teams. Today we showed we are a team and fought hard. We lost but we are proud of our performance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Israel began the weekend at the top of the group, but is now third, two points back following the losses to Wales and Belgium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Belgium is now in a strong position to qualify for the 2016 finals in France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The top two from each group qualify automatically along with the best third-place team.</td></tr>
