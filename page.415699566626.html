<tr><td>2</td><td>Washington - Microsoft on Monday unveiled partnerships with Samsung and other manufacturers to install its services including Word and Skype on devices powered by the rival Google Android system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The move is part of a push by Microsoft, which has been lagging in efforts to get Windows-powered devices in the marketplace, to deliver services to consumers and businesses using Apple and Android hardware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Microsoft said it was expanding a deal with Samsung - which had already agreed on pre-installing Microsoft services on its high-end smartphones - to include some tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The deal will provide Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive and Skype on "select Samsung Android tablets", a statement from the Redmond, Washington, group said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Our partnership with Samsung is emblematic of our efforts to bring the best of Microsoft's productivity services to everyone, on every device, so people can be productive wherever, however and whenever they want," said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a separate statement, Johnson said 10 other hardware makers would also install Microsoft services on their Android devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>These firms include US-based Dell, TrekStor of Germany, JP Sa Couto of Portugal, Datamatic of Italy, DEXP of Russia, Hipstreet of Canada, QMobile of Pakistan, Tecno of Africa, and Casper of Turkey, and Pegatron - a Taiwan-based firm which makes devices for other brands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Original device manufacturers are important because they extend Microsoft services to the ecosystem," Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"More specifically, they help to reach a greater number of other device manufacturers, resulting in even more choice for customers around the world. And for Microsoft, this is part of the company's mobile-first, cloud-first vision."</td></tr>
