<h3>SXSW music notebook: Iggy's missed opportunity</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Whatever the amount, though, I'm pretty sure the Australian rapper didn't come to Austin just for the money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She was looking for a reset, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The beginning of 2015 has been rough for Azalea, who dominated pop last year with three monster singles - "Fancy," "Problem" and "Black Widow" - that at one point were all in the top 10 of Billboard's Hot 100.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>So impressive was her ascent that when she was nominated for four Grammy Awards, many observers predicted (some worriedly) that she'd win them all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But then things started falling apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Azalea was unexpectedly shut out at the Grammys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She quit social media in response to the "hatred and pettiness" she said she was subjected to online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And last week she postponed an upcoming arena tour, citing "production delays" widely assumed to be code for lack of interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Even in the days before her performance here, the Internet pounced on a video showing Azalea rapping incoherently - a small crime for some but a damning one for a white MC many have criticized for appropriating a black style with little regard for its meaning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>("The Vine that proves Iggy Azalea can't rap," the blog Vulture called the clip.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>So with its high visibility and its audience happily susceptible to spin, SXSW offered Azalea a chance to reclaim her damaged narrative, to brush off the haters and show us why she's still worth paying attention to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Well, maybe next time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sparsely attended by the sardine-can standards of many high-profile SXSW concerts of years past, Wednesday's gig felt like a missed opportunity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The problem wasn't her rapping, which was confident - and more or less comprehensible - in songs like "Beg for It" and "My World."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Wearing a gold-and-black jacket over shorts and thigh-high boots, Azalea stomped across the stage like she belonged there - a victory of sorts, I suppose, given how often her very existence has been challenged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But she was taking no discernible pleasure in her exercise of power, even in "Trouble," which she introduced as "a feel-good song," and "Bounce," during which she instructed the crowd to do the festive dance known as the Nae Nae.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>(The 10 or 12 people not taking pictures with their phones complied.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And she embodied no palpable sense of struggle in moodier cuts like "Don't Need Y'all," about how fame feels "like a curse latched to my blessing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As she ran through the song with a blank look in her eyes, Azalea seemed drained by the task at hand - not just putting in her 45 minutes for a corporate-sponsored gig but figuring out the next step in her career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But then, right before the end of the show, she tore into "Iggy AZN," a delightfully bratty kiss-off, with the kind of intensity she'd seemed incapable of summoning until that point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Not every artist will shine in a setting like SXSW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It takes a certain mix of confidence and perseverance to survive this week, and with 20 minutes or less to set up a stage, any sense of perfectionism is better left at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tuesday night's highlight, Torres (real name: Mackenzie Scott), didn't waste any time getting on stage five minutes early and then packing high drama into taut, guitar-driven songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Tired, stressed and "just 23," as she sang on "New Skin," Torres let her backing trio accentuate her emotional anxiety rather than go for broke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Rhythms went for a "Tell-Tale Heart"-esque pounding, keyboards lit a gasoline fuse that encircled the orchestrations and Torres' own guitar scraped along the concrete while her deep, forceful voice punched holes into the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There's a sense with Torres' songs that a whole life has been lived within them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Sprinter" views the world as a predatory one, and "Strange Hellos," the lead single off her forthcoming sophomore album, simmers with tension-building guilt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Songs start out as ballads, and then become something louder, more brute, as Torres lets every chord change creak like a rusty door hinge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>At a club next door, Natalie Prass took a more refined route, though the setting wasn't suited for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>This up-and-comer has already outgrown the tiny space she performed in, which meant getting a glimpse of the stage was mostly impossible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It wasn't until Prass introduced her band that anyone except those in the first row had any idea that there were four people on stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Still, going by sound alone, Prass was in fine form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>This is a compliment, but if Cinderella left the Disney films to start a band, it may sound something like Prass' mix of pop classicism and lush, yet restrained arrangements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Hints of jazz and varying shades of warmth appear throughout as Prass' tales of love gone wrong unfold, leaving ample space for an orchestra within them.</td></tr>
