<tr><td>5</td><td>An Indian Air Force person walks carrying a Nepalese child, wounded in s earthquake, to a waiting ambulance as the mother rushes to join after they were evacuated from a remote area at the airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, Monday, April 27, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The death toll from Nepal's earthquake is expected to rise depended largely on the condition of vulnerable mountain villages that rescue workers were still struggling to reach two days after the disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Landslides and other destruction delayed attempts to reach the district earlier, but Gorkha is feared to have extensive damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Darvas says most of the newer concrete buildings were intact after the quake but remote mountainside villages were reportedly devastated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He says, "Further north from here the reports are very disturbing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He says up to 75 percent of the buildings in Singla may have collapsed and the village, a two-days walk away, has been out of contact since Saturday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Local officials lost contact with military and police who set out for Singla, and Darvas says helicopters have had to turn back because of clouds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He says a few SUVs with foreign tourists bringing basic aid supplies had begun to reach Gorkha by early evening.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>Xinhua quoted an official with the Tibetan bureau of sports as saying that an avalanche at 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) and the possibility of further aftershocks was considered to have made climbing too dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There was no word on when the ban would be lifted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Chinese side of Everest is less popular with climbers, in part because a special permit is required to enter Tibet.</td></tr>
