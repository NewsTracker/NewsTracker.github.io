<h3>Germany's mixed messages on keeping Greece in euro serve a purpose at home and abroad</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN - German government officials have appeared to send mixed messages about their desire for Greece to keep using the euro - and that's just the way they want it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The approach has helped keep up the pressure on a Greek government viewed in Berlin with deep suspicion, while also keeping increasingly disgruntled conservative German lawmakers in line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wolfgang Schaeuble, Chancellor Angela Merkel's hawkish finance minister, has been in the spotlight since a leaked document from his ministry proposed the possibility of a voluntary, temporary Greek euro exit - suggesting in the strongest terms yet that Athens' European creditors were contemplating a Eurozone without Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That helped turn up the heat on Athens ahead of Monday's agreement on a bailout plan full of tough conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Even after that deal, Schaeuble continued talking about a potential "Grexit" ahead of a Greek Parliament vote Wednesday on new austerity measures and Friday's German Parliament vote to approve detailed bailout talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On Thursday, he said that "it would perhaps be a better way for Greece, and many say that - increasingly in Greece too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The tough talk appeared aimed in part at reassuring wavering lawmakers in Merkel's and Schaeuble's own conservative bloc that their leaders weren't about to go soft on Greece's radical left-led government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The German Parliament has to vote on all-new rescue packages and major amendments to existing ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Once a bailout is finalized - expected to take several weeks - Merkel will have to face lawmakers again, and she needs to keep in check distaste and resistance to the bailouts in her conservative bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>For now, the dissent was manageable in Parliament, where Merkel's coalition has a huge majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Lawmakers voted 439-119, with 40 abstentions, to give the government a mandate for talks with Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The "no" votes included 60 of the 311-strong conservative caucus - double the previous record set in February when Parliament approved a four-month extension to Greece's previous bailout, but not a dangerous level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Merkel has sent more emollient signals than Schaeuble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She said Friday that simply leaving Greece to crash out of the euro could lead to "chaos and violence" - though she drew a clear distinction between that and the idea of a voluntary time-out, which she said could only be decided in agreement with Greece and all the other eurozone countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Neither was interested in the idea, and "this way was not viable," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"However great the political differences may be, we are dedicating ourselves to Greece being able to remain in the eurozone," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Schaeuble didn't directly refer to a Greek euro exit in Friday's debate, but concluded his speech with a coded warning to Athens: if Greece does its part, he said, "we will put all our strength into making this last chance a success."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The message: play by the rules or you could still risk cutting off aid and leaving the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>His hard-line approach drew a withering attack from the opposition Left Party, which is allied to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' Syriza party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We had a good reputation internationally, Mr. Schaeuble, and you have begun to destroy it," caucus leader Gregor Gysi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Wherever our citizens go, they will feel it. And that is a great shame."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Gysi also admonished Merkel, saying that she portrays herself as strong but that Schaeuble's actions show "you are weak, too weak."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Merkel's and Schaeuble's apparently divergent positions look more like a "good cop, bad cop" division of labor, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The two have different roles - his main job is to look after German taxpayers' money, while she must consider wider concerns, including expectations abroad that the eurozone resolve its problems and the political implications of a Greek departure from the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The pair regularly rank among Germany's three most popular politicians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Balancing Germany's budget, and ensuring that financial rules are adhered to elsewhere, have been a major plank of their appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Schaeuble, 72, a veteran lawmaker who helped negotiate German reunification, enjoys strong credibility and loyalty in his ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He also has strong credentials as a longtime advocate of European integration, saying Friday that he has a "warm heart" but a "cool head" is also necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Conservative lawmakers applauded at length when Merkel thanked Schaeuble for his role in negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>However, Schaeuble's talk of a "Grexit" has been awkward for their junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Their leader, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, has faced questions about how much he knew of Schaeuble's suggestion and pressure from within his own ranks to push back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>At the same time, he appears keen to reassure center-left voters that he's looking after their tax money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The Greek government deserves "help and support" now that it has decided to swing behind reforms, Gabriel said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"We are partners in implementing the result of the negotiations, and not opponents."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"For us in Germany, that means that all debates about a Grexit must come to an end," he said.</td></tr>
