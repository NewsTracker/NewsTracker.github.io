<h3>Unwelcome mat: White House tries to counter Netanyahu visit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There are limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Administration officials have discarded the idea of President Barack Obama himself giving an Iran-related address to rebut the two speeches Netanyahu is to deliver during his early March visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But other options remain on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Among them: a presidential interview with a prominent journalist known for coverage of the rift between Obama and Netanyahu, multiple Sunday show television appearances by senior national security aides and a pointed snub of America's leading pro-Israel lobby, which is holding its annual meeting while Netanyahu is in Washington, according to the officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The administration has already ruled out meetings between Netanyahu and Obama, saying it would be inappropriate for the two to meet so close to Israel's March 17 elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the White House is now doubling down on a cold-shoulder strategy, including dispatching Cabinet members out of the country and sending a lower-ranking official than normal to represent the administration at the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Vice President Joe Biden will be away, his absence behind Netanyahu conspicuous in coverage of the speech to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other options were described by officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Netanyahu's plan for a March 3 address to a joint meeting of Congress has further strained already tense ties between the U.S. and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Congressional Republicans orchestrated Netanyahu's visit without consulting the White House or State Department, a move the Obama administration blasted as a break in diplomatic protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some Democratic lawmakers say they will boycott the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>U.S. officials believe Netanyahu's trip to Washington is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, Obama's signature foreign policy objective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While Netanyahu has long been skeptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions that would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His opposition has intensified as negotiations go into overdrive with an end-of-March deadline for a framework deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I think this is a bad agreement that is dangerous for the state of Israel, and not just for it," Netanyahu said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The difference of opinion over the deal has become unusually rancorous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The White House and State Department have both publicly accused Israeli officials of leaking "cherry-picked" details of the negotiations to try to discredit the administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And, in extraordinary admissions this week, the administration acknowledged that the U.S. is withholding sensitive details of the talks from Israel, its main Middle East ally, to prevent such leaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The rebukes have only emboldened the leader of Israel, whose country Iran has threatened to annihilate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He has a double-barrel attack on the Iran talks ready for when he arrives in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Not only will he address Congress, he will also deliver similar remarks at the AIPAC conference, an event to which administrations past and present have traditionally sent top foreign policy officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>An AIPAC official said Friday that the group has not yet received any reply to its invitation for senior administration figures to attend the meeting that starts March 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The official stressed that last-minute RSVPs are not unusual, but the White House has been signaling for some time that a Cabinet-level guest may not coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Instead, the administration is toying with the idea of sending newly installed Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken to speak to the conference, according to officials familiar with internal discussions on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But it's possible Treasury Secretary Jack Lew could attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, who have both previously addressed AIPAC, will be out of the country on foreign travel that appears to have been arranged to make them unavailable to speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Biden will be visiting Uruguay and Guatemala on a trip that was announced after Netanyahu's speech was scheduled, while the State Department announced abruptly this week that Kerry will be traveling to as-yet-determined destinations for the duration of the AIPAC conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Obama spoke to AIPAC in 2012, while he was in the midst of his re-election campaign.</td></tr>

<h3>Youth fighting 'superbug' infection from Los Angeles outbreak</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Infection by the carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria, or CRE, during endoscopies at a large teaching hospital in the University of California at Los Angeles system has contributed to two deaths among the seven patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Officials warned that as many as 179 people who had endoscopies at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center may have been exposed to the so-called superbug.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The procedures were done between Oct. 3 and Jan. 28.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>All five of the confirmed infected patients who remain alive are under treatment, said UCLA spokeswoman Dale Tate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The infections all occurred during procedures in which a specialized scope, known as a duodenoscope, was inserted down the throat to diagnose and treat pancreatic and bile duct diseases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The outbreak has raised questions about whether methods for cleaning the endoscopes were adequate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The 18-year-old man, whose name has not been released, was among those infected by CRE, said attorney Kevin Boyle, a member of his legal team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The man went to the medical center in mid-2014 for a pancreatic ailment and received an endoscopy, Boyle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The man became ill and was hospitalized a short time later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>By November, he had been diagnosed with CRE.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The youth spent 83 days in the hospital, mostly in the intensive care unit, the attorney said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's definitely a severe infection," he said, adding that the infection had landed the young man back in a Los Angeles hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 18-year-old was not in the intensive care unit but was under 24-hour monitoring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The (man's) prognosis is unknown," Boyle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He would not give the name of the hospital where the young man is being treated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Further details on the conditions of the five infected patients have not been disclosed, and details on the circumstances of the two deaths have not been made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Officials have said there is no broader threat to public health, and that hospital officials have called and sent letters to at-risk former patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>All of them are at home, rather than at a hospital, Tate said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>No further infections have been reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Corey Egel, a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health, said the short-term risk window for additional CRE infections among the patients who came into contact with the scopes was over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>There remains, however, a possibility of future infections if the organism was able to colonize inside any of the patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Any person who is colonized with any multi-drug resistant organism is at some increased risk in the future of developing an infection with that organism," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The medical center has said that it had been sterilizing the duodenoscopes implicated in the infection, which it began using in June, according to manufacturer standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It has said it now uses a more rigorous process that exceeds national standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The two infected scopes were immediately removed from use for return to the manufacturer, Olympus Medical Systems Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Olympus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Hospitals across the United States have reported exposures from the same type of medical equipment in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it was working with other government agencies and scope manufacturers to minimize risks to patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>California's public health department said no other hospitals in the state have seen a similar outbreak.</td></tr>
