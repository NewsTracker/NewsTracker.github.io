    <title>&lt;p&gt;The compromise reached at an EU summit in Brussels maintains EU unity on sanctions against Moscow over its role in the Ukraine conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU governments were divided on whether to act now to renew economic sanctions on Russia which expire in July or to wait several months before taking a decision to see if the Ukraine ceasefire holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the link to the Ukraine peace agreement effectively extends economic sanctions until the end of the year because the Minsk accord sets a year-end deadline for Kiev to recover full control over its border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yatseniuk also said the EU had not yet responded to Ukraine's request for U.N. peacekeepers or an EU police mission to monitor the ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

We agreed to this to avoid the spilling of fraternal blood," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ukraine did not renew itself," it continued. Rebels have pushed for revisions to the constitution to decentralize power, but argue that authority is still held by powerful businessmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said in an emailed statement that enacting the special status law without elections approved by Kiev would result in the legitimization of what Ukraine considers unlawful rebel governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zakharchenko and Plotnitsky said placement of a peacekeeping contingent had not been agreed at cease-fire negotiations concluded between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France last month in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;On Friday evening, Ukraine's current pro-Europe president, Petro Poroshenko, spoke at a gathering of thousands on the square to commemorate the dead and echoed the belief that their deaths were not pointless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will stop the war and after a few years everyone will see how Ukraine has changed; we feel with every cell how the people demand that change be accelerated," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He vowed to fight the "fear, panic and mistrust" that he said "a neighboring state" was trying to sow in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poroshenko on Friday claimed Ukraine has evidence that Vladislav Surkov, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's advisers, organized the snipers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He surfaced the next day in one of his political strongholds in eastern Ukraine and then disappeared again until he turned up in Russia, where he eventually bitterly abandoned any claim to still being president.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;The two heads of state, along with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia, signed accords on Feb. 12 in a last-ditch effort to stabilize and bring peace to Ukraine " starting with a cease-fire that both Ukraine and rebels now say has been violated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union earlier this week said it has added 19 more individuals on its Russia sanctions list for their actions linked to the fighting in eastern Ukraine, bringing the total number to 151.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Britain's former senior NATO commander General Richard Shirreff said British Prime Minister David Cameron's failure to act over Ukraine had turned him into a "foreign policy irrelevance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's Foreign Office said no one could have predicted the scale of the "unjustifiable and illegal" Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine, and that it is for the Ukrainian people to decide whether they want a closer relationship with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

    <title>&lt;p&gt;The West says Putin, who has called eastern Ukraine "New Russia", has sent troops and weapons to back the rebels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow denies this and accuses the West of waging a proxy war in Ukraine to seek "regime change" in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting began after the overthrow of a Moscow-backed president in Ukraine last February and Russia's annexation of the Crimea peninsula a month later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two separatist leaders said in a statement the rebels would pull out of the ceasefire if Kiev made any further moves to abandon Ukraine's neutral status - also a red line for Moscow, which fears Ukraine might seek to join the NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt;</title>
