<h3>U.S. probe finds systematic, racially biased policing in Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON/KANSAS CITY, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(Reuters) - A U.S. probe found systemic racial bias targeted blacks and created a "toxic environment" in Ferguson, Missouri, but cleared a white officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager there, Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report said the St. Louis suburb overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to blacks to boost city coffers through fines, used police as a collection agency and created a culture of distrust that exploded in August when Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized; a community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents," Holder told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brown's killing touched off a national debate on race, led to months of street protests and amplified long-standing complaints in Ferguson and across the country of police harassment and mistreatment of minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It also prompted Justice Department probes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Of course, violence is never justified," Holder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"But seen in this context, amid a highly toxic environment, defined by mistrust and resentment, stoked by years of bad feelings, and spurred by illegal and misguided practices, it is not difficult to imagine how a single tragic incident set off the city of Ferguson like a powder keg."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Holder, who is stepping down soon as attorney general, called for wholesale and immediate change in the way Ferguson operates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>City officials said they would address the report later on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a city where blacks make up about two-thirds of the population, they accounted for 85 percent of the total charges brought by Ferguson police, and more than 90 percent of arrests, Holder said, citing city records reviewed for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Some police would compete to see who could issue the most citations to African-Americans, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Often the charges were trumped up, or fictitious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Police and city officials laced their emails with racist jokes, Holder added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The city also looked to double its revenue in fines collected by the courts to a projected $3 million for its 2015 fiscal year, from over $1.3 million in 2010, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Ferguson police officers issued nearly 50 percent more citations in the last year than they did in 2010 - an increase that has not been driven, or even accompanied, by a rise in crime," Holder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The report also led to fresh calls for Police Chief Tom Jackson and the city's mostly white leadership to step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"He absolutely should not have that job anymore," said St. Louis-area lawyer Brendan Roediger, who has helped represent some of those protesting police actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>U.S. officials confirmed on Wednesday they could not find a civil rights reason to prosecute Wilson, who was not charged by a grand jury in Missouri for the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., parents of the slain teen, said the decision not to pursue federal charges against Wilson disappointed them but the report could cause changes in Ferguson and other parts of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"If that change happens, our son's death will not have been in vain," they said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Jeff Roorda, a spokesman for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, said rather than blaming racial bias, there should be a "mature, frank conversation in the country about why kids like Michael Brown ... end up in deadly confrontations with police."</td></tr>

<h3>Mexico authorities arrest leader of brutal drug cartel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY -- Mexican police and soldiers on Wednesday captured Omar Trevino Morales, widely considered to be the most important leader of the Zetas drug cartel that once carved a path of brutal bloodshed along the country's northern border with the U.S., a federal official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name because of government policy, said the man known as "Z-42" was arrested in a pre-dawn raid in San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy suburb of the northern city of Monterrey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Mexican government had offered a 30-million peso ($2 million) reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had offered a $5 million reward for his capture, saying he was wanted on drug-trafficking charges, but listed "Omar" as an alias and his given name as Alejandro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>DEA spokesman Rusty Payne confirmed they are the same person, and said "we certainly are excited and congratulate Mexico for another great arrest."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano "El Lazca."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Omar apparently took over leadership of the Zetas - a gang originally formed by deserters from an elite army unit - after his brother's arrest in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Zetas left a trail of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But much of the violence along Mexico's northeast border now is due to internal battles among Gulf cartel factions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The capture of Omar Trevino Morales follows Friday's arrest of another big cartel leader, Servando Gomez, known as "La Tuta."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gomez allegedly led the Knights Templar, a pseudo-religious drug gang that built up control of many sectors of the economy in the western state of Michoacan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The two arrests provided much-needed good news for the administration of Enrique Pena Nieto, battered by a series of scandals in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The government needed to show that some of its policies were successful," said Raul Benitez, a security expert at Mexico's National Autonomous University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"And in this case, without doubt the strategy against the drug cartels is going well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Like Servando Gomez, Omar Trevino Morales was captured without any shots being fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Trevino Morales brothers took proceeds from their U.S. drug sales and laundered them by purchasing American quarter horses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That scheme was led by Jose Trevino Morales, a third brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A jury in Texas found Morales guilty in May of investing $16 million of drug money in the buying, training and racing of horses across the Southwest United States.</td></tr>
