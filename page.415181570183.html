<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu gives controversial speech to US congress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington: Benjamin Netanyahu used his controversial address to Congress to paint a dystopian vision of an Iran acting as a nuclear-armed IS terrorising the world should US President Barack Obama continue to pursue negotiations with the regime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Speaking after the address, Mr Obama said Mr Netanyahu had offered no new alternatives to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and noted that his rhetoric on Iran's nuclear program had been proved wrong in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An unnamed and angry senior White House official told CNN that the speech contained "literally not one new idea; not one single concrete alternative; all rhetoric, no action".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Damning of Obama's proposed nuclear deal with Iran ... Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (centre) addresses a joint meeting of Congress in the House Chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Where is the alternative? Simply demanding that Iran completely capitulate is not a plan, nor would any country support us in that position. The prime minister offered us no concrete action plan."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said: "The unbreakable bonds between the United States and Israel are rooted in our shared values, our common ideals and mutual interests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"That is why, as one who values the US - Israel relationship, and loves Israel, I was near tears throughout the Prime Minister's speech - saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5+1 nations, and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chill in relations ... US President Barack Obama will not meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on his visit to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Observers agreed that Mr Netanyahu had made an effective political speech, deftly articulating his opposition to negotiations with Iran, and that he had severely damaged his relationship with Barack Obama, the leader of his nation's most crucial ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Martin Indyk, the Brookings Institution's head of foreign policy and a former US ambassador to Israel, told CNN it was clear that the speech had dangerously politicised the alliance and that the relationship between two leaders had deteriorated from bad to toxic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Netanyahu was welcomed to the joint session of Congress with thunderous applause from Republican members, while over 50 Democrats - including six Jewish representatives - boycotted the address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Damning of Obama's proposed nuclear deal with Iran ... Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a joint meeting of Congress two weeks before Israel's national election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Standing at the speaker's lectern from which Mr Obama gives his State of Union address, Mr Netanyahu depicted Mr Obama as naive, saying that in attempting to negotiate a settlement with Iran he was gambling the security of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Netanyahu, who the Republican House Speaker, John Boehner, had invited to address Congress without notifying the White House - a serious breach of protocol - was interrupted by applause over 40 times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He likened Iran to Nazi Germany - and as many noted, by implication, Mr Obama to Neville Chamberlain - and said any deal with Iran would pave the way to it developing a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) acknowledges applause at the end of his speech, which has sent the Israel-US relationship to a new low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"When it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We must always remember the greatest danger facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons . . . That deal would not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran will get those weapons."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said the deal being considered in talks in Geneva even as he spoke contained two dangerous concessions to Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>According to reports the deal might allow Iran to maintain its nuclear infrastructure, and it might expire after a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After the speech Mr Obama said that no deal had yet been struck, and that the US would walk away from negotiations rather than come to a weak agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Israel insists that no deal should be made and Iran should be forced to cede its entire program by international pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Apparently responding to critics who say Mr Netanyahu has used the speech to his domestic political benefit in the lead up to this month's election in Israel, Mr Netanyahu said: "I deeply regret some perceive my being here as political. That was never my intention."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The speech was live streamed on the website of the Likud Party, which Mr Netanyahu leads.</td></tr>

<h3>Homeless man shot dead by LAPD served time for armed robbery: Report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Los Angeles Times, citing records and its own sources, said the man was identified as Charley Saturmin Robinet, 39, a French national, who was accused of pistol-whipping a bank teller during the 2000 holdup of a Wells Fargo Bank branch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to the newspaper, Robinet told investigators during initial questioning following his arrest that he robbed the bank to cover the cost of acting classes at the Beverly Hills Playhouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Authorities have yet to publicly identify the man who was fatally shot by three Los Angeles Police Department officers outside the Union Rescue Mission when they approached him in response to a reported skid-row robbery on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But a law-enforcement source told Reuters on Tuesday that the Los Angeles Times had correctly identified the man, including the fact that he had been convicted of bank robbery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police have said the man was shot when he tried to grab the holstered pistol of one of the officers involved in efforts to subdue and restrain him as they sought to take him into custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The struggle and shooting were caught by an onlooker on video that went viral over the Internet, leading to protests and calls by civil rights activists for a special police commission hearing on the use of force by law enforcement on skid row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The head of the rescue mission told Reuters on Monday that the man, who went by the street name of Africa, had been living in a tent outside the mission for weeks and had a history of violent, erratic behavior.</td></tr>
