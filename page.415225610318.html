<h3>Egypt interior minister replaced in cabinet reshuffle</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Officials said Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim was replaced by another police general, Magdy Abdel-Ghafar.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Yehia Ghanem, a well-known Egyptian journalist and resident fellow at New York's City University, told Al Jazeera that "the main objective of such a reshuffle is to calm down segments of society angry over eroding security and flagrant violations of human rights".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He also said the fact the reshuffle came just a few days before the country's major economic investment conference showed that Sisi believed political change was needed urgently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The situation in Egypt is getting more critical, because if it was not that critical no sane person would make that reshuffle just days before that very important conference on rehabilitating the Egyptian economy," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It is the first cabinet reshuffle since Sisi, a solider-turned-politician, took office in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A year ago he led the military ouster of the Mohamed Morsi, the nation's first freely-elected leader.</td></tr>
