<h3>Kenya orders UN to move massive Somali refugee camp</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kenya has in the past accused fighters of hiding out in Dadaab camp which it now wants the UN refugee agency UNHCR to move across the border to inside Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have asked the UNHCR to relocate the refugees in three months, failure to which we shall relocate them ourselves," Deputy President William Ruto said in a statement on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The way America changed after 9/11 is the way Kenya will change after Garissa," he said, referring to the university that was attacked on April 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Al Jazeera's Mohamed Adow, reporting from Garissa in Kenya, said that Ruto warned that if the UN fails to remove the camp, the government would do so itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He also quoted Ruto as saying that the move was necessary to secure its border with Somalia, which Kenya has failed to do so because of the camp's impediments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The complex of camps hosts more than 600,000 Somali refugees, according to Ruto, in a remote, dry corner in northeast Kenya, about an hour's drive from Garissa town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The camp was first established in 1991 when civil war broke out in neighbouring Somalia, and over subsequent years has received waves of refugees fleeing conflict and drought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The United Nations puts the number of registered refugees in the chronically overcrowded settlements of permanent structures, mud shanties and tents, at around 335,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The camp houses schools, clinics and community centres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Macharia Munene, professor of international relations at USIU-Africa, said the logistics of moving hundreds of thousands of refugees across the border would be "a tall order".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But he said there were now safe areas within Somalia from where al Shabaab armed group had been chased out by African Union forces in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Kenya is in an emergency situation... Each country has an obligation to look after its people first," he told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Funerals of the students killed in the campus attack were taking place across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Pictures of their grieving families dominated the media, reminding Kenyans of the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ruto said Kenya had started building a 700-km (440-mile) wall along the entire length of the border with Somalia to keep out members of al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We must secure this country at whatever cost, even if we lose business with Somalia, so be it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Tuesday, Kenya closed 13 informal money remittance firms, hawalas, to cut off funding to suspected fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ruto said any business that collaborated with al-Shabab would be shut down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Al-Shabab has killed more than 400 people on Kenyan soil in the last two years, including 67 during a siege at Nairobi's Westgate mall in 2013, damaging tourism and inward investment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Monday, the Kenyan air force launched air strikes against al Shabab targets in Somalia, a country where it has been militarily engaged against the armed group for several years.</td></tr>
