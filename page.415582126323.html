<h3>Pricey smartwatches: Google teams with TAG Heuer, Intel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>You already know that the upper crust Apple Watch Edition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK - Ready for another battle between Apple and Google?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This time it could be over lavishly priced smartwatches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>You already know that the upper-crust Apple Watch Edition watches are slated to arrive April 24, at prices north of $10,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the Baselworld international trade show for watches and jewelry in Basel, Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>on Thursday, Google, Intel and luxury watchmaker TAG Heuer announced a partnership to launch an Android Wear-based smartwatch sometime in 2015, promising an elegant alternative to the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Swiss watchmaking and Silicon Valley is a marriage of technological innovation with watchmaking credibility," said Jean-Claude Biver, CEO of TAG Heuer, in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Android Wear director of engineering David Singleton chimed in too: "By fusing beauty with technology, the Swiss watch has inspired generations of artists and engineers alike - including us at Google. So we're thrilled to be working with TAG Heuer and Intel to bring a unique blend of emotion and innovation to the luxury market."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For his part, Intel's general manager of the new devices group, Michael Bell, says the Google-TAG Heuer-Intel collaboration "elevates the category" for wearables.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The partners aren't revealing much about what a new watch or watches will look like, beyond saying that it will fit into the TAG Heuer design ethos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The specifications of such devices are also a mystery as is the cost and the precise timing (beyond this year) of a watch's release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Meantime, given TAG Heuer's pedigree - the Swiss watchmaker has been at it since 1860 - it's reasonable speculation to suggest that you won't see such TAG Heuer Android Wear watches sell for less than $1,000, and quite possibly a lot higher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple's loftiest-priced Apple Watch Edition commands $17,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>At the low end, entry level Apple Watch Sport devices start at $349.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some Android Wear watches, by contrast, can be had for as little as $200.</td></tr>
