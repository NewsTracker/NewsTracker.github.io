<h3>U.S. soccer: American women beat Mexico 5-1 in exhibition</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Leroux made her first start of the year and scored twice in a 5-1 victory for the United States over Mexico on Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The forward started off 2015 with a right foot injury and had been working her way back into peak form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Coming out there and scoring those goals, it made me miss scoring a lot," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You don't realize it until it happens."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Abby Wambach also scored twice in the second send-off match for the United States in advance of the Women's World Cup next month in Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Wambach, who came in as a substitute to start the second half, scored on a penalty kick in the 58th minute and added a header in the 72nd minute to bring her career total to 182 goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She has scored 24 goals against Mexico, the most has against any nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lori Chalupny added a goal for the United States early in the second half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ariana Calderon scored on a header for Mexico late in the first half, snapping Hope Solo's shutout streak at five matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It was the first goal the U.S. conceded to Mexico since November 2010, when Las Tri surprised the Americans with a 2-1 victory in World Cup qualifying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Americans were playing without forward Alex Morgan, who has a bone bruise in her left knee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The former Cal player also might miss the final send-off match against South Korea at Red Bull Stadium in New Jersey on May 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Leroux scored from a seemingly impossible angle in the 28th minute, for her first goal in 14 matches, to put the United States up 1-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Las Tri evened it just before the half on Calderon's header.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chalupny entered the game to start the second half and scored on her first touch, with a feed from Wambach in the 46th minute, to put the Americans up 2-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Attendance for Sunday's match was announced at 27,000, a sellout and the largest crowd for a U.S. women's match at StubHub Center.</td></tr>
