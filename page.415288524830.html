<h3>Ukraine rebels insist heavy weapons withdrawn from front line</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Snizhne: Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine claim to have fulfilled their end of a February deal with government forces to withdraw heavy weapons from the front line as part of a ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Today is the last day of the weapons withdrawal," Eduard Basurin, one of the rebel leaders, told reporters in the town of Snizhne on Saturday, where the separatists displayed eight 120mm mortars that had been moved back from their positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Watched by six international monitors, who declined requests for comment, the separatists towed the arms to a disused brick factory serving as an arms depot, about 90 kilometres from the rebel hub of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A battered Ukrainian army helmet in Yenakievo, Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rebels claim they have withdrawn heavy weapons from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Basurin said the separatists were withdrawing a total of 26 mortars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They will be stored with the rest of the military hardware," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Four other artillery pieces were seen inside the Snizhne depot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A pro-Russian rebel cleans equipment at the weekend near the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Under the terms of the European-brokered, Russian-backed truce, signed in the Belarussian capital, Minsk, on February 12, both sides to Ukraine's 11-month conflict must move their artillery back far enough to create a buffer zone of between 50 kilometres and 140 kilometres, depending on the weapons' range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The process has been fraught with distrust and mutual recriminations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both parties have accused the other of merely paying lip service to the peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Alexander Zakharchenko, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, accused Ukraine's government of failing to live up to its side of the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A trench near the front line in Horlivka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We have fully removed heavy weapons from the line of contact. Ukraine has not yet done it," he told the separatist news agency DAN, threatening to redeploy the arms if Kiev did not match the de-escalation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ukrainian army spokesman Anatoliy Stelmakh said the government was upholding its end of the bargain, saying the army was continuing to withdraw its 220mm Uragan rocket launchers from the conflict zone, after earlier pulling back its smaller Grad multiple rocket systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The process is ongoing," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The end of the nearly daily deluge of shelling and rocketing, which has killed more than 6000 people in eastern Ukraine since April 2014, would be a coup for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, architects of the Russian-backed ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is monitoring the truce, has recorded arms movements on both sides over the past two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>However, it said it was being denied access to the information it needed to confirm weapons were being put beyond use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After a blood-soaked start to the truce - as the rebels fought on to seize the transport hub of Debaltseve - eastern Ukraine regained a measure of peace in the past two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Beyond the heavy weapons, the deal also calls for the withdrawal "of all foreign-armed formations" and military equipment from Ukrainian territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The accord also commits Kiev and the rebels to exchange all prisoners and to negotiate a change to Ukraine's constitution by the end of 2015, in order to give rebel-held areas more autonomy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On Saturday, they again traded accusations of violating the ceasefire in the past 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But there was good news in Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"For the first time over the past few months" no Ukrainian soldier was killed or injured by rebel fire, a military spokesman said.</td></tr>
