<h3>U.S. top court throws out conviction for Facebook threats</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A general view of the U.S. Supreme Court building at sunrise is seen in Washington October 5, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out the conviction of a Pennsylvania man found guilty of making threatening statements on Facebook to his estranged wife, law enforcement officers and others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The court ruled on an 8-1 vote in favor of Anthony Elonis, who served prison time for posting a series of statements on the social media site in 2010 after his wife left him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Seven justices voted to throw out his conviction, while Justice Samuel Alito said he would have sent the case back to the appeals court for it to decide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Elonis' Facebook posts, written in the form of rap lyrics, talked about killing his wife, knifing an female FBI agent and shooting schoolchildren.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After a court granted his wife a protective order against him, Elonis posted: "Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The justices ruled that in order to prosecute Elonis, it was not sufficient that a reasonable person would have interpreted the remarks as threatening but rather that Elonis had to have intended the words as threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act without considering the defendant's mental state," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote of behalf of the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The case touched upon the rise of social media and how people use it to express strongly held feelings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the legal question decided by the court was that Elonis needed to be aware of the threatening nature of his communication in order to be convicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Lower courts had said he could be culpable regardless of whether he believed his messages could be viewed as threatening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Justice Clarence Thomas was the only member of the court who would have upheld the conviction outright.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He criticized the court's reasoning, saying it "throws everyone from appellate judges to everyday Facebook users into a state of uncertainty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Alito partially disagreed with the outcome, saying the appeals court should be given another opportunity to decide whether the conviction could be upheld.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Elonis was convicted of violating a federal law that outlaws sending a threatening communication and was sentenced to 44 months in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The case is Elonis v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>USA, U.S. Supreme Court, 13-983.</td></tr>
