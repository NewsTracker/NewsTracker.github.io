<h3>Ukraine urges EU to keep up sanctions pressure on Russia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EU President Donald Tusk said the decision reached at a two-day summit showed the common resolve of the 28 EU nations in the face of Russian involvement in the conflict.</td></tr>

<tr><td>16</td><td>It was not immediately clear whether the EU approved such a force Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Everyone wants to get peace in Europe. One of the tools to reach this peace is to deploy peacekeepers," Yatsenyuk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Also Thursday, an influential European Parliament committee voted in favor of a plan to provide Ukraine with 1.8 billion euros ($1.92 billion) in medium-term loans to help lift the country out of recession.</td></tr>
