<h3>Ferguson to hire another interim police chief as anniversary of Michael Brown's death nears</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FERGUSON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- The St. Louis suburb of Ferguson is getting a new interim police chief as the anniversary of the killing of a black 18-year-old nears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The city's media affairs department says Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and interim City Manager Ed Beasley will announce the appointment Wednesday morning at the Ferguson Community Center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new chief will be the second since Police Chief Thomas Jackson stepped down in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That came days after a Justice Department report cited racial bias and profiling in Ferguson policing alongside a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targets blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Justice Department scrutiny came after the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown by a white officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That officer was cleared, though the shooting and eventual decision not to charge the officer sparked often-violent protests.</td></tr>
