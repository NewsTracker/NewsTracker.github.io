<h3>Man indicted in shooting at Ferguson demonstration that wounded 2 police officers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ST. LOUIS - A 20-year-old St. Louis man has been indicted on felony assault and weapons charges linked to a March shooting that wounded two police officers during a Ferguson protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A St. Louis County grand jury indicted Jeffrey Williams Wednesday on two counts of first-degree assault, three counts of armed criminal action, and one count of shooting from a motor vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The indictment, which replaces a March criminal complaint against Williams, also adds a felony count of unlawfully possessing a firearm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Williams is accused of wounding the officers during an early-morning rally March 12 sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Both officers, who survived, were monitoring protests outside the St. Louis suburb's police station, which has been a nexus of unrest since a white Ferguson officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prosecutors have alleged that Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has countered that his client has recanted that story, told him he never shot a weapon that day and only confessed after being roughed up by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman has called Christmas' assertions that investigators battered a confession out of Williams "completely false."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Schellman said Williams was seen by a nurse when he was first booked into the county jail - standard procedure for all incoming inmates -who deemed him "fit for confinement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Williams remains jailed in lieu of $300,000 cash-only bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Online court records show his arraignment is scheduled for June 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A message left Friday by The Associated Press with Christmas was not immediately returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ferguson has been a national focal point since Brown was killed Aug. 9 by then-police officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A grand jury declined to indict Wilson in November, and a Justice Department investigation cleared Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A separate DOJ report released in March found widespread racial bias in Ferguson's policing and municipal court system.</td></tr>
