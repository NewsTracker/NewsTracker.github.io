<h3>Theft of deadly radioactive material in Mexico sparks alert</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Hospital equipment containing radioactive waste was stolen in Mexico in 2013, putting the thieves in hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Authorities in Mexico have issued an alert in several states after thieves snatched potentially deadly radioactive material used for industrial radiography.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The iridium-192, marked X-571, was inside a container when it was stolen on Monday from a truck in Cardenas, a town in southern Tabasco state, the interior ministry said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This source is very dangerous to people if it is removed from its container," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The ministry launched an alert for civil protection authorities in the states of Tabasco, Campeche, Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz, as well as the federal police, the navy and the army.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It said that if not handled with proper protection "this source could cause permanent injuries to the person who handles it or who has been in contact with it for a brief time", believed to be only minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Being close to this quantity of unprotected radioactive material for hours or days could be fatal," the statement warned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The interior ministry urged people to avoid touching the material if found, establish a 30-metre security perimeter around the source and immediately notify federal authorities of the discovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is the latest case of radioactive material being stolen in Mexico, after thieves took a truck containing a cancer-treating medical device with highly radioactive cobalt-60 near Mexico City in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They were unaware about the contents of the cargo and when authorities arrested the thieves and recovered the material, the suspects were hospitalised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They all survived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That theft prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency to issue an alert for "extremely dangerous" material, and the US government to keep tabs on the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>More recently, in February, authorities recovered three stolen trucks in central Mexico that had been transporting radioactive material for industrial use.</td></tr>
