<h3>Greek Officials Lobby EU, ECB for Swift Loan Payout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A woman paints tables before going on sale at her shop in Athens, Greece, on Monday, May 4, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Weekend negotiations between Greece and rescue lenders have made progress, officials on both sides said Monday even though Athens stressed it needed a swift release of delayed bailout money to keep up with debt payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With Greek ministers dispatched across the European Union on a whirlwind goodwill tour, the EU's top finance official said he expected Athens and its creditors to make "good progress" by next Monday on finding a way to keep the nation afloat and in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>EU Commissioner Pierre Moscovici discussed the protracted bailout talks with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis in Brussels on Tuesday as the country faced the prospect of running out of money within weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece and the eurozone finance ministers are meeting on May 11, just a day before Athens is scheduled to make a 750 million euro repayment to the International Monetary Fund it is not certain it can afford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"What I hope is that before May 11, in one week exactly, we will be able to have seen good progress in our discussion," Moscovici said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"That is the signal that everyone is waiting for, both in Greece and by its partners."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, Germany, Greece's biggest European creditor, suggested the May 11 deadline was optimistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'm rather skeptical that we'll manage it by Monday but I don't rule it out," Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told a group of reporters in Berlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said the talks were more constructive than in the past but the timing of a deal was still uncertain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Schaeuble also denied reports that the IMF had told eurozone finance ministers that Greece would need a trim to its debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As Varoufakis was shuttling from Athens to Paris and Brussels, Greek Deputy Prime Minister Yannis Dragasakis was to meet in Frankfurt with European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>After a cantankerous meeting with his eurozone colleagues last month, Varoufakis wanted to make a point during bilateral talks Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It was particularly important to lay out the positive moves the Greek government has made since February so there can be an agreement," he said after meeting his French counterpart Michel Sapin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The international creditors are pushing the Greek government to deliver economic reforms and budget measures demanded before they want to unlock the remaining 7.2 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in its bailout fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But the leftwing government wants to safeguard a core of campaign promises that were vital in its January election victory, all centering on relaxing the austerity measures that had been imposed on Greece to somehow stave off its financial decline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Elena Becatoros in Athens and David Rising in Berlin contributed to this report.</td></tr>
