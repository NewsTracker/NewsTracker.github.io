<h3>Kenya fight against Shebab shifts to its own backyard</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>From hit and run attacks and massacres to a shopping trip, Somali-led Shebab militants are on the march in northeastern Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With large numbers of troops in southern Somalia but seemingly unable to effectively police its own outer regions, Kenya must react quickly to stop the al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamists from gaining significant ground and finding a new generation of recruits, Western security officials say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The Somalia theatre is no longer of interest to the Shebab," a Western security source told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They've been defeated there. They are losing momentum, and their rare operations there don't get much media attention. It's the opposite in Kenya, where they have found a new playground for their jihad, a new source of recruits and a very strong potential to destabilise."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The upsurge in cross-border attacks and the emergence of Kenya-based Shebab cells is now Kenya's number-one security headache, and a strategic blow given that it deployed troops into southern Somalia in 2011 in the hope they would serve as a buffer and protect the long, porous border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Instead, Shebab units -- hunted by African Union troops and US drones inside Somalia -- have flanked the Kenyan contingent to mount a string of gruesome cross-border raids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the Mandera region, 28 passengers were dragged from a bus and executed late last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Days later, 36 quarry workers were pulled from their tents at night and murdered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Garissa, just half a day's drive from the capital Nairobi, a small group of gunmen stormed the town's university in April and massacred nearly 150 students during a day-long siege.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While the heavy death tolls and high-profile attacks grab the headlines, security sources say that a series of low profile, non-deadly operations -- during which the militants briefly fill the space left vacant by the Kenyan security apparatus -- are equally worrying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Last month the militants entered a village in Garissa County and delivered a hardline sermon to a captive audience before withdrawing unhindered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This week, suspected Shebab members moved into a village in Mandera County, another impoverished border region, forcing schools to close and some residents to flee, the Nation newspaper reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The paper said the gunmen chatted with residents who remained in the village, and even shopped for goats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's a repeat of the strategy of AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb)," commented another Western security official, pointing to the growth strategy of the Islamists in the Sahara, notably into northern Mali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said there was an urgent need for the Kenyan government to reassert its control over the border region -- pointing to the fact that many paved border crossings were simply unmanned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There are signs Kenya's leadership may be taking stock of the shift in Shebab strategy, and that the question of pulling out of Somalia -- up to now dismissed as akin to giving in to terrorism -- may at least be up for discussion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>- Towards a Somalia exit strategy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Quoted by Capital FM news on Tuesday, the chairman of the Kenyan Senate's National Security and Foreign Relations Committee, Yusuf Hajji, signalled that an exit strategy was no longer taboo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The aim is to come up with a 'white paper' that will detail a strategy on how to fight insecurity in Kenya," he was quoted as saying, adding the plan would also include measures to "de-radicalise youth" in the impoverished, Muslim-majority border regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He nevertheless stressed that any pull-out from Somalia was dependent on Kenya's African Union troop-contributing partners, according to Capital FM, and notably the possibility of finding another country that could take Kenya's place in southern Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Even if it can redeploy significant manpower to the border region, Kenya also faces an uphill task in winning over hearts and minds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Kenyan police said earlier this week they were investigating photos posted on social media -- allegedly by a senior member of the force -- that appear to show officers mercilessly whipping a group of young Somali men in Garissa County with a rubber hose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Local MP Abdikadir Ore said such incidents were commonplace, and the reason why Kenya's fight against Islamic extremism "cannot be won" without a major change in the conduct of it security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"How will the security agencies expect the local people to work with them while they torture people in this manner?" said Khalif Abdi, coordinator of the North-Eastern Forum for Democracy.</td></tr>
