<h3>Mexico nabs Zetas drug cartel leader 'Z-42': official</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The suspect, known as "Z-42," was detained without a shot being fired by federal police and soldiers in San Pedro Garza Garcia, an upper-class suburb of the northern industrial city of Monterrey, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Trevino, who had a combined bounty of $7 million on his head, took over the Zetas after his brother, Miguel Angel Trevino, or "Z-40," was captured by marines in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas in July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He was considered "one of the most dangerous and bloodthirsty criminals in Mexico," said Tomas Zeron, the investigations chief at the attorney general's office, adding that Trevino is accused of organized crime, kidnapping and drug trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hours after his capture, the portly cartel honcho was wearing a button-down shirt, exposing a chest tattoo, as he was flanked by two soldiers with camouflage face-paint and hauled into an armored truck at the Mexico City airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His fall comes on the heels of another major coup for the government, the capture last Friday of Mexico's most-wanted man, Knights Templar cartel leader Servando "La Tuta" Gomez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The arrests give President Enrique Pena Nieto, who is on a state visit to London, major victories over drug cartels amid public anger over his government's handling of security, particularly the investigation into the disappearance and alleged murder of 43 college students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>US Drug Enforcement Administration chief Michele Leonhart congratulated Mexico, saying the arrest "strikes at the heart of the leadership structure of the Zetas."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The US State Department had offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mexico offered $2 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His age was listed at 38 by Mexico and 41 by Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Zetas are considered one of the most cruel criminal organizations in Mexico, accused of melting enemies in a barrel of "stew," slaughtering 72 migrants in August 2010 and igniting a fire that killed 52 people in a Monterrey casino in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The group, founded by former elite soldiers, was originally the armed enforcer of the Gulf Cartel until the two groups split in 2010, unleashing a wave of violence in northern Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The government dealt a first blow to the Zetas in 2012 when top leader Heriberto Lazcano was killed in a gunfight with troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Despite lacking military background, the Trevino brothers rose through the ranks of the paramilitary cartel, which exploited migrants and stole gasoline in addition to smuggling drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In 2010, Omar Trevino told an informant that he had killed more than 1,000 people while Miguel had killed 2,000, according to an affidavit filed in a US court for a case involving another Trevino brother in Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Omar Trevino was unable to exert control over the group, said National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Due to his extremely violent profile, he didn't get the recognition that his brother had within the organization. He faced opposition from local operators who sought to break away, a situation that led to more clashes within the criminal group," Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Trevino was found after investigators tracked the movements of the cartel's finance chief, who visited several homes in the Monterrey suburbs, Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In February, a person resembling Trevino was seen in one of the houses, prompting authorities to step up surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Trevino had a small security team in an bid to "go unnoticed," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>While his arrest is a victory, analysts warn that capturing cartel leaders does not necessarily mean an end to drug trafficking or violence, and that it can create smaller, vicious splinter groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"With this I think that the Zetas are going to have a very large void in terms of leadership," Mike Vigil, a retired chief of international operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"The big problem here, though, is that if the Zetas splinter into other organizations, then that can lead to violence in terms of the internal competition."</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>Tsarnaev is charged with conspiring with his brother to place two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line in April 2013, killing three and injuring 260 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A lawyer for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (joh-HAHR' tsahr-NEYE'-ehv) has begun her opening statement by admitting her client participated in the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Judy Clarke says: "It was him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She says the only thing the defense disagrees with prosecutors about is "why."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clarke calls the bombings a "series of senseless, horribly misguided acts carried out by two brothers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But she portrayed brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev as the ringleader, saying he planned it and "enlisted his brother into these series of horrific acts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tamerlan died in a shootout with police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Clarke says: "The evidence will not establish and we will not argue that Tamerlan put a gun to Dzhokhar's head or that he forced him to join in the plan, but you will hear evidence about the kind of influence that this older brother had."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A prosecutor says Tsarnaev's motive for the Boston Marathon bombing was to reach paradise by claiming victory in a holy war against Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said Wednesday in opening statements that Tsarnaev "acted like he didn't have a care in the world" after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He says Tsarnaev hung out with friends while victims learned their limbs would have to be cut off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The prosecutor described how 8-year-old Martin Richard stood on a metal barrier with other children so he could see the runners.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>Tsarnaev's trial has begun with opening statements from the prosecution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Weinreb said Wednesday that Tsarnaev carried a bomb in a backpack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The prosecutor says: "It was the type of bomb favored by terrorists because it's designed to tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tsarnaev had no reaction and continued to look straight ahead - not at the jury, not at the prosecutor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Weinreb continued: "The air was filled with the smell of burning sulfur and people's screams."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Jurors deciding Tsarnaev's fate have been sworn in and are listening to preliminary instructions from the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Before the jury was brought in, Judge George O'Toole Jr. granted a prosecution motion to limit the amount of evidence the defense can present about the relationship between Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, during the guilt phase of the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tamerlan died during a gun battle with police days after the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>O'Toole says some evidence of the brothers' interactions will be "inevitable," but most should be reserved for the second phase of the trial, when jurors will decide whether Tsarnaev receives the death penalty or spends the rest of his life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Tsarnaev is sitting alone at the defense table as his lawyers and prosecutors huddle at a sidebar with the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>After a few moments, a member of his defense team goes to sit next to him.</td></tr>

<tr><td>32</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers had acknowledged their three earlier requests were denied but said they wanted to complete the record of their opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>They have argued their client couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts because of the publicity of the case and the proximity to the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Victims of the Boston Marathon bombing have arrived at court for opening statements in Tsarnaev's trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Two busloads of people hurt in the bombings arrived at the federal courthouse at 7:30 a.m. Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>They entered through a side entrance, away from reporters and photographers gathered at the main entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Marc Fucarile (FYOO'-kuh-rihl) went in the front entrance but did not comment to reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He lost a leg in the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Lawyers for Tsarnaev have made it clear they will try to show that he was influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan, who died following a shootout with police days after the bombings.</td></tr>
