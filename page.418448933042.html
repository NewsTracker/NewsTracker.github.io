<h3>Service ahead of MH17 disaster anniversary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Families of those killed when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine last year demanded justice at a memorial ceremony ahead of the first anniversary of the disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The service at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was attended by Prime Minister Najib Razak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Relatives of those who died used the opportunity to air their continued frustrations over the handling of the tragedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We want to find out who shot down the plane. We must find out," said Ivy Loi, whose husband Captain Eugene Choo was one of the pilots on board the flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The event saw grieving families observe a minute's silence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many became emotional when the names of the passengers scrolled across screens in tribute to the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Boeing 777 passenger jet was travelling between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down in eastern Ukraine on 17 July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At the time, some of the worst fighting was taking place between government forces and pro-Russian separatists who took up arms against Kiev's pro-Western government a few months earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>All 298 passengers and crew on board the Malaysia Airlines jetliner, the majority of whom were Dutch, died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Suspicions immediately fell on the separatists, who may have used a surface-to-air missile supplied by Russia to shoot down the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However, Moscow flatly denied it was involved and pointed the finger instead at Ukraine's military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Speaking at the memorial, Mr Najib said the international criminal probe into the downing of the plane was ongoing and could be completed by the end of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Detailed investigations are still continuing ... and they are expected to be finished by the end of 2015 at least," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Malaysia has asked the United Nations Security Council to set up an international tribunal to prosecute those suspected of downing the plane, but Russia dismissed the move.</td></tr>
