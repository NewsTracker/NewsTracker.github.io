<tr><td>2</td><td>Washington: Hillary Clinton has agreed to testify before a House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Benghazi investigation committee, had sought to hear from Clinton on the attacks, in which four Americans were killed, and her use of a private email account while she was America's top diplomat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A spokesman for Clinton, the front-runner in polls for the Democratic nomination in next year's presidential election, said she had accepted an offer from the committee to testify on October 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Earlier this week we were pleased for Secretary Clinton to receive an offer from Congressman Gowdy to appear before the committee in a public hearing in October, and yesterday accepted his invitation," campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in an emailed statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A few hours after the Clinton campaign announced her planned appearance, Jamal Ware, spokesman for the Benghazi committee, said the date was not firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Secretary Clinton's campaign may want to reach out to her lawyer, Mr. David Kendall, with whom the Committee has had ongoing conversations," Ware said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"As of last night, Mr Kendall was still negotiating conditions for her appearance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ware said the conditions proposed by Kendall were that the date of her testimony not change once it was set and that questioning of Clinton stay within parameters set by the resolution that established the committee.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>At least four emails out of some 30,000 from that private account contained classified information, according to a government inspector's letter to Congress this week.</td></tr>
