<h3>German prosecutors: Germanwings co-pilot hid illness from employers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>French prosecutors said Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, "intentionally" crashed the jet into the side of a mountain Tuesday in the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A police car waits in front of the house of the family of Andreas Lubitz in Montabaur, Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lubitz was the co-pilot on the Germanwings plane that crashed with 150 people on board on Tuesday in the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A police officer stands in front of an apartment building where they believe Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of the crashed Germanwings airliner jet, lived in Duesseldorf, Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>French emergency rescue services work at the site of the Germanwings jet crash near Seyne-les-Alpes, France, on March 26, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This picture from the Facebook page of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz shows him posing in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>German prosecutors say they have found evidence that the co-pilot of the Germanwings plan which crashed in the French Alps appears to have hidden evidence of an illness from his employers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prosecutors in the western city of Duesseldorf say they seized medical documents from the home of Andreas Lubitz that indicate "an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Passengers with moments to live screamed in terror and the pilot frantically pounded on the locked cockpit door as a 27-year-old German co-pilot deliberately and wordlessly smashed an Airbus carrying 150 people into an Alpine mountainside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prosecutor Ralf Herrenbrueck said in a statement Friday that torn-up sick notes for the day of the crash "support the current preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said the search of Lubitz's home revealed no suicide note or evidence of any political or religious motivation for his actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Police searched the homes of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz in two German cities for an explanation of why he crashed a passenger plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board, as an aviation official revealed that his pilot's license referenced a physical or mental health condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Investigators carried multiple boxes of items from Lubitz's apartment in Duesseldorf and his parents' house in Montabaur, near Frankfurt, but Duesseldorf police spokeswoman Susanna Heusgen said that "no crucial piece of evidence has been found yet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A German aviation official told The Associated Press on Friday that Lubitz's file at the country's Federal Aviation Office contained a "SIC" note, meaning that he needed "specific regular medical examination."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Such a note could refer to either a physical or mental condition, but the official - who spoke only on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information, said the note does not specify which.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>However, neighbors described a man whose physical health was superb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"He definitely did not smoke. He really took care of himself. He always went jogging. I am not sure whether he did marathons, but he was very healthy," said Johannes Rossmann, who lived a few doors down from Lubitz's home in Montabaur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>German news media painted a picture of a man with a history of depression who had received psychological treatment, and who may have been set off by a falling out with his girlfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Duesseldorf prosecutors, who are leading the German side of the probe, refused to comment on the anonymously sourced reports, citing the ongoing investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said there was a "several-month" gap in Lubitz's training six years ago, but would not elaborate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Following the disruption, he said, Lubitz "not only passed all medical tests but also his flight training, all flying tests and checks."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had issued Lubitz a third-class medical certificate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In order to obtain such a certificate, a pilot must be cleared of psychological problems including psychosis, bipolar disorder and personality disorder "that is severe enough to have repeatedly manifested itself by overt acts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The certificate also means that he wasn't found to be suffering from another mental health condition that "makes the person unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges" of a pilot's license.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>French investigators, who are in charge of the probe into the plane crash, believe the 27-year-old locked himself inside the cockpit and then intentionally smashed the Germanwings plane into a mountainside on Tuesday during a flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>People in Montabaur who knew Lubitz told AP they were shocked at the allegations that he could have intentionally crashed the plane, saying he had been thrilled with his job at Germanwings and seemed to be "very happy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Germanwings, a low-cost carrier in the Lufthansa Group, said it was setting up a family assistance center in Marseille for relatives of those killed in the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"In these dark hours our full attention belongs to the emotional support of the relatives and friends of the victims of Flight 9525," Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said in a statement.</td></tr>
