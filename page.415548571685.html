<h3>Missing South Carolina cat found 2 years later in California</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - A cat that vanished in South Carolina two years ago is going home after ending up nearly 2,000 miles away in Southern California.</td></tr>

<h3>Apple TV 'skinny' package likely to accelerate cord cutting</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Some customers may use the device to replace their cable box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple's ambition to be a dominant player in television is expected to accelerate the unraveling of the pay-TV bundle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The tech giant is in negotiations with major television companies to offer a "skinny" package of channels that would include ABC, CBS and Fox Broadcasting, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple wants to roll out the service in time for the new fall shows in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The proposed streaming service takes aim at the 10 million homes that have high-speed Internet and no pay television programming, along with customers who are fed up with high cable fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple's cachet and legions of loyal fans could make it one of the biggest threats yet to cable and satellite operators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple customers are unable to access its iTunes Store, App Store and other services, the company confirmed Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Apple remains one of the few companies in the world that has the potential to transform the TV industry, and we believe consumers are ready for a change," Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White wrote Tuesday in a research report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The company is the latest to stake its claim in the fast-growing market of Internet television services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Netflix and Amazon.com already offer subscription services, and Sony Corp. plans to launch its own TV offering for its PlayStation game console.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dish Network last month rolled out its Internet-delivered service called Sling TV that starts at $20 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple last week unveiled its deal to offer HBO Now, a $14.99-a-month Internet streaming service on Apple devices beginning next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Its planned Web TV subscription service would cost customers about $30 a month, the people said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Any new subscription service ultimately would be designed to spur sales of the company's Apple TV device, which some consumers could use to replace their cable box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Last week, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook slashed the price of the device to $69 from $99.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The recent moves should help prompt cable and satellite TV providers to offer their customers smaller packages of services at lower price points to remain competitive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Consumers for years have been grousing about the high cost of subscriptions that include hundreds of channels they never watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The floodgate is now open," CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said during a recent investor conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Clearly the bundle is changing.... The days of the 500-channel universe are over."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>After years of false starts, Apple finally is getting traction with programmers that previously rebuffed its overtures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>These programmers, including CBS and Fox, don't want to get left behind as consumers find ways to cut through the cable clutter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Apple is willing to pay up to provide the channels - and that makes business sense for the programmers in an era of declining ratings and ad revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Apple, CBS, ABC and Fox on Tuesday declined to comment on discussions, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It was unclear Tuesday exactly which TV networks would be included in the proposed Apple service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Apple is said to be focusing on deals with companies such as 21st Century Fox that own both a major broadcast network and cable channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>NBC is not in discussions with Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>However, as part of a 2011 agreement with the federal government, NBC's parent company, Comcast Corp., is legally obligated to provide its programming to Internet services if NBC's rivals also participate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The new service also might not include regional sports channels, which have helped drive up the cost of pay TV in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But analysts are not ready to write the obituary for the pay-TV industry just yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We are going to see an increase in cord cutting, but it's not going to be dramatic," predicted James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"The main reason it won't be dramatic is there is no way to cut the cord and still get everything you want."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>For example, Dish's Internet streaming service, Sling TV, offers ESPN, ABC Family, Cartoon Network and Food Network - but not ABC and CBS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Dish introduced the service last month to appeal to budget-conscious consumers and apartment dwellers unable to install an antenna on their roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Sling TV, which starts at $20, allows consumers to add packages like sports and lifestyle programming for an additional $5 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Analysts point out that the low cost might be deceiving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>People still would have to turn to cable and phone companies for their Internet service, some of which tack on fees if users exceed established data caps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>This could be easy to do when users are spending hours streaming TV shows and movies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Cable TV distributors also are expected to fight back by making their bundles of Internet and TV channels "economically attractive as a way to retain consumers," Nomura Securities analyst Anthony DiClemente said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Switching to a broadband-only package might save customers about $30 to $50 a month at current promotional rates, but adding Apple's Web TV Service, Netflix and HBO Now "quickly erodes those savings," DiClemente said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Cable companies already have gotten the memo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>For example, Comcast has a promotional Internet service plus TV package for about $40 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The slimmed-down package has 25 channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and HBO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Cox Communications, which provides cable service in Orange County, has a low-cost option that includes high-speed Internet, basic TV channels and premium networks HBO and Starz at a promotional rate as low as $69 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Apple has had a slow march into TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>When it was launched in 2007, the Apple TV box was billed as a way to purchase movies and TV shows from iTunes and display it on a television set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>But now, ESPN, Bloomberg TV and others offer content that can be seen live through Apple TV apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Despite persistent rumors about manufacturers in Apple's Asian supply chain revving up Apple-branded television sets, neither a display nor a newly designed Apple TV streaming box has appeared on the shelves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The current Apple TV device is capable of streaming dozens of channels, but the recent price cut for the box has stoked speculation that a new version could debut later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>A newer box might handle ultra-high-definition resolution, which provides a step up in picture quality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Experts think that Apple's advantage comes from its strong track record of developing products that have clean and user-friendly designs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"They do have this very loyal fan base and a great usability that's not possible in the more fractured environments of other devices," said Field Garthwaite, chief executive of Iris.Tv, a Los Angeles start-up that builds video recommendation technology.</td></tr>
