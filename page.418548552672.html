<h3>Apple releases surprise iPod Touch refresh</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple is refreshing its iPod Touch music player for the first time in nearly three years, as the company seeks to make music a central part of its devices once again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new Touch has a faster processor and better cameras, plus a software update that enables Apple Music, a $10-a-month service that offers unlimited playback of millions of songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple Music launched June 30 as music fans increasingly embrace subscriptions over pay-per-song services such as Apple's industry-leading iTunes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The iPod was Apple's first successful foray beyond personal computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Interest has waned, though, as many people now use smartphones such as the iPhone to listen to music.</td></tr>
