<h3>4th man charged in NYC over Islamic State recruitment plot</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dilkhayot Kasimov was named with three other previously charged defendants in a revised indictment unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He faces charges of conspiracy and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prosecutors accused Kasimov of working closely with another man, Abror Habibov, to raise $1,600 for a third, Akhror Saidakhmetov, to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Saidakhmetov was carrying the cash when he was intercepted at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Feb. 25 trying to board a flight to Turkey, court papers say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After being detained on immigration charges, Kasimov admitted he delivered the money to the 19-year-old Saidakhmetov and knew that the teen "might be" traveling to Syria, court papers say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Agents also uncovered "electronic communications in which Kasimov encouraged others to participate in violent jihad," they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Kasimov "served as a money man in support of a co-defendant's efforts to join ISIL," Diego Rodriguez, head of New York's FBI office, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There was no immediate response to inquiries on Monday with the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn about when Kasimov would appear in court or if he had a lawyer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Last month, Saidakhmetov, Habibov and Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev - all immigrants from the former Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan - pleaded not guilty in the same case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prosecutors accused Juraboev of also trying to travel to Syria via Turkey to join the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Juraboev first came to the attention of law enforcement during the summer of 2014 after he made a posting on an Uzbek-language website that backs the Islamic State, court papers say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"In his post, Juraboev offered to engage in act of martyrdom on U.S. soil on behalf of ISIL, such as killing the President of the United States," the papers say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Defense attorneys for the three men originally charged in the case have denied the allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The charges against Kasimov come amid a spate of recent terrorism cases related to the Islamic State's efforts to attract foreign fighters or encourage sympathizers to launch an attack in America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Last week, two women were arrested on charges that they sought to build a homemade bomb after embracing the radical views of groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State.</td></tr>
