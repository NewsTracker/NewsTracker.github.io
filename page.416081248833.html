<h3>Islamic State frees more than 200 Yazidis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The self-styled Islamic State group has freed more than 200 members of Iraq's Yazidi minority it held captive for months, according to a commander in the Kurdish peshmerga security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We have received 227 Yazidis, among them women and children" in the northern province of Kirkuk Wednesday, Major General Westa Rasul said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We negotiated for days with tribal sheikhs in Hawijah and were able to free the kidnapped Yazidis," Mr Rasul said, referring to a town in Kirkuk under IS control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Yazidis were actually freed on Monday in Nineveh province, northwest of Kirkuk, but did not make their way to a Kurdish-controlled territory until two days later, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The mass release of the Yazidis, who were kidnapped in Nineveh last year, is the second of its kind, after some 200 mainly elderly people were set free in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A sweeping IS offensive overran large areas north and west of Baghdad last June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A second drive in August targeted areas in the north that were home to many of Iraq's minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Yazidis, who are neither Muslims nor Arabs, practice a unique faith and are considered infidels by the jihadists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They looked in danger of being wiped out of their ancestral land until a US-led air campaign turned the tide on IS advances in northern Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The UN has said the IS campaign of killings, abductions and rape against Yazidis may amount to genocide.</td></tr>
