<h3>Greek parliament to vote on bailout bill within next 2 days</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's Prime minister Alexis Tsipras delivers a speech during a gathering at the Agriculture ministry in Athens, Greece, on Wednesday, Aug. 5, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ATHENS, Greece -- Greece's government submitted the draft bill for a new bailout to parliament overnight, in the hope of tapping the new rescue loans in time to avoid defaulting on its debts next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called an emergency session of parliament to discuss and vote on the bill, which includes painful tax hikes and spending cuts, by the end of Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tsipras has been facing fierce opposition to the bailout from hardliners within his left-wing Syriza party, although the bill is expected to pass in the 300-member parliament with votes in favour from lawmakers in pro-European opposition parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece has been anxious to conclude a deal with its creditors for the three-year, roughly 85 billion euro ($93 billion) in time to receive funds ahead of an Aug. 20 debt repayment due to the European Central Bank from its first bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tsipras is asking the assembly's speaker to have the bill go through committee level Wednesday, ahead of a full debate and vote Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Parliament Speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou, a dissenter within Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party and vociferous bailout opponent, reportedly scheduled the parliamentary procedure to start only Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That would delay the process and meaning a vote would likely be held in the pre-dawn hours of Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The draft bailout agreement sees Tsipras accepting what he had vowed to resist only months ago: the sale of some state property and deep cuts to pensions, military spending and ending tax credits to people considered vulnerable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The bill includes legislation opening up protected professions to more competition, increasing personal, corporate and property taxes and abolishing early retirements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tax hikes cover sectors as diverse as diesel fuel for farmers, private school tuition and Greek-interest shipping, while small businesses and freelances will have to prepay the entire amount of the following year's taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The deal contains legislation on issues as detailed as where fresh bread can be sold, the expiry date of fresh milk and regulations on when stores can hold discount sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Once Greece's parliament ratifies the bill, the deal needs the approval of the other 18 eurozone nations' finance ministers, who are to discuss the issue Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Several countries, including Germany, which has been Greece's harshest critic, must then also ratify the deal in their own parliaments before any funds can be disbursed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Germany has so far sounded cautious at best over the deal, saying Wednesday when it was announced that Berlin would need to examine the details.</td></tr>
