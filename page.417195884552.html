<h3>Gunfight in western Mexico kills at least 42: officials</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY At least 42 people were killed on Friday in western Mexico in a gunfight between suspected gang members and security forces, two government officials said, the latest bloodshed in an area that has been plagued by violent drug gangs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least two federal police died in the morning clash near Tanhuato in the state of Michoacan, near the border with Jalisco, a region home to Mexico's second-biggest city, Guadalajara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The vast majority of those killed in the fight were suspected gang members, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A week ago federal forces replaced local police in Tanhuato following the assassination of a candidate for mayor in a nearby town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jalisco, one of the engines of the Mexican economy, is the base of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which has become a major headache for President Enrique Pena Nieto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The cartel has killed at least 20 police since March and on May 1 the gang shot down an army helicopter in southwestern Jalisco, killing six military personnel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a series of concerted attacks that day, the gang also set vehicles, banks and gas stations ablaze around Guadalajara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The killings have increased pressure on Pena Nieto to deliver on a pledge he made upon taking office in December 2012 to bring stability to Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party hopes to defend the slim majority it and its allies have in the lower house of Congress in mid-term elections on June 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>More than 100,000 people have died in clashes between the drug gangs and security forces since the start of 2007.</td></tr>
