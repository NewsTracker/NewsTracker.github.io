<h3>Netanyahu denounces Iran nuclear deal but faces criticism from within Israel</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has denounced the historic deal on Iran's nuclear programme as it became clear that Israel would continue to pressure allies in the US Congress to derail the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Heading a chorus of condemnation from Israeli politicians - including members of his rightwing coalition - Netanyahu said the agreement was a "capitulation" and a mistake of historic proportions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Iran is going to receive a sure path to nuclear weapons," Netanyahu said on Tuesday at a meeting with the Dutch foreign minister, Bert Koenders, in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Many of the restrictions that were supposed to prevent it from getting there will be lifted. Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonanza of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the world. This is a bad mistake of historic proportions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Netanyahu led a procession of senior Israeli politicians seemingly bent on outdoing each other with their rhetoric over the deal as Israel remained markedly alone in the stridency of its criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The former foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the hard right Yisrael Beitinu, described the deal as a "surrender to terror", while the defence minister, Moshe Yaalon, said it was built on Iran's "lies and deceit".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He labelled the agreement "a tragedy for all who aspire for regional stability and fear a nuclear Iran".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Most apocalyptic was the education minister, Naftali Bennett, leader of the far right Bayit Yehudi, who warned: "The history books have been rewritten again today, and this period will be deemed particularly grave and dangerous."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said: "Western citizens who get up for another day at work or school are not aware of the fact that about half a trillion dollars has been transferred to the hands of a terrorist superpower, the most dangerous country in the world, who has promised the destruction of nations and peoples.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Today it may be us, tomorrow it may reach every country in the form of suitcase bombs in London or New York. Israel has done everything possible to warn of danger and in the end it will follow its own interests and will do whatever it takes to defend itself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Netanyahu's is determined to encourage allies in the US Congress to try to block the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However, the comprehensive answers in the document to Democrats' concerns - not least on the mechanism for reintroducing sanctions should Iran backslide on its commitments - are likely to make that effort an uphill struggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Barack Obama made clear on Tuesday that he would veto any attempt to block the deal in Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Criticism of Netanyahu's handling of the Iranian issue has grown over the past two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Yair Lapid, head of the Yesh Atid party, denounced Netanyahu's diplomatic campaign as a "colossal failure".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I also am not thrilled by Obama's polices. But Netanyahu crossed a line that caused the White House to stop listening to Israel," Lapid said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"In the last year we weren't even in the arena, we had no representative in Vienna, our intelligence cooperation was harmed, and the door to the White House was closed to us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"He [Netanyahu] should resign, because if you promise for years that only you can prevent this deal and then it's signed, you're responsible," Lapid declared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That criticism was echoed by other senior opposition figures, including the Zionist Union's Isaac Herzog, who - while opposing the deal - criticised Netanyahu's alienation of Obama's White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Shelly Yachimovich, a Zionist Union member of the Knesset, said Netanyahu should "immediately cease and desist from confronting the Americans".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>She said: "Now that this dangerous, damaging agreement with Iran has become a fait accompli, Netanyahu must stop disseminating prophecies of doom, come to his senses and regroup, in order to improve Israel's position and defend its interests when the agreement is implemented."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The increasingly harsh assessment of Israel's failure to have any real leverage in the talks was echoed in the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Columnist Ben Caspit, a long-time Netanyahu critic, said: "No matter how we look at it, this is a personal failure for Netanyahu, who has been promoting himself for two decades now on one central agenda alone: preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear capability. That is the task that he promised he would perform, and he has failed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>That was echoed in the Jerusalem Post by Yossi Melman, who, writing before a deal was formally announced, wondered whether it would be as bad as Netanyahu had said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Israel exaggerated the Iranian threat and portrayed it in monstrous proportions," Melman wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The nuclear deal in the making is far from perfect," he added, "but the skies are not going to fall tomorrow".</td></tr>
