<h3>Russia's Putin calls Boris Nemtsov's murder political</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that the murder of Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov was a shameful tragedy that carried a political subtext.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, was shot dead as he walked with his girlfriend on Friday night near Red Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in Russia during Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Kremlin has denied any involvement, saying that the killing was a "provocation" designed to discredit Putin and strengthen his opponents, but Nemtsov's friends say the Kremlin is to blame for fomenting an atmosphere of hatred towards its opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext. Russia should be devoid at last of the kind of shame and tragedies that we have recently endured and seen," he said in a speech during a meeting with officials from the interior ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I mean the murder, the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Law enforcement officials have said one lead they were exploring was that the killing was linked to Nemtsov's personal life or business dealings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Putin's comments indicated that version is now being discarded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Authorities have not made any arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Earlier on Wednesday, the director of Russia's Federal Security Service said that an investigation had identified several suspects, without giving details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Russian news agencies reported that investigators were seeking a car in connection to the killing that may be connected to the finance ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters that the car, a Ford, does not belong to the ministry itself but was owned by a state enterprise which provides security to government institutions, including the finance ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The vehicle drove past the spot where Nemtsov was shot after the killing and when police patrol cars had already arrived at the scene, the statement said.</td></tr>

<h3>Europe Could See Beginning Of Two-Tier Internet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EU member states are drawing up proposals to allow internet service providers (ISPs) to prioritise specific internet traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the chief executives of both Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom both argued for rules to allow them to give priority to some services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Operators often cite emergency services data as an example of traffic that should be prioritised - but many fear that customers will see their traffic throttled in favour of higher-paying individuals and corporations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>New proposals by Latvia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Council, has outlined its belief that traffic across networks should be treated equally.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>The rules will be put to the ambassadors or representatives of EU council member states for a vote on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If passed, they will then be discussed by the European Parliament, the European Commission and the EU Council again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Last week, the US Federal Communications Commission passed new rules to require companies to act in the "public interest" and not intentionally block or slow web traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A Democratic commissioner who voted in favour of the rule said: "We cannot have a two-tiered internet that speeds the traffic of the privileged and leaves the rest of us lagging behind."</td></tr>
