<h3>IMF abandons debt talks with Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has dramatically abandoned Greece debt talks in Brussels, blaming major disagreements with Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Issues broke out between the IMF and Greece's delegation mid-negotiations for a cash-for-reform deal, causing the IMF's delegation to fly home to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>IMF spokesman Gerry Rice blamed the actions on differences of opinions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There are major differences between us in most key areas," Mr Rice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There has been no progress in narrowing these differences recently and thus we are well away from an agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said the causes of the disagreement, which prompted European stocks to fall, were pensions, taxes and financing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greece's entire delegation followed suit and left for home the same day, citing continuing disagreements, according to a Greek source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The surprise moves came as the European Union (EU) told Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras to stop gambling with his cash-strapped country's future and make the crucial decisions needed to avert a devastating default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece needs a deal to unlock aid before the end of the month, when it is otherwise set to default on an over $2.3 billion repayment to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There were fears this could trigger capital controls and push Greece out of the euro zone, with unpredictable consequences for financial markets and the European economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greek spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said Athens stood by its assertions of recent days that all is not lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The Greek delegation, as agreed, is ready to intensify deliberations in order to conclude a deal soon, even in the coming days," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Although the IMF technical team had returned to Washington, they were said to have remained "fully engaged" with Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Game over for Greece?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>European Council President Donald Tusk delivered an unprecedentedly forthright message to Greece's radical anti-austerity government after four months of bitter negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"There is no more time for gambling. The day is coming, I'm afraid, that someone says that the game is over," he told a news conference after chairing an EU-Latin America summit that was dominated by intense talks with Mr Tsipras on the sidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It is very obvious that we need decisions, not negotiations," he said, adding that Athens needed to be "more realistic".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>German Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann and EU Economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici also warned time was running out to avert a Greek state bankruptcy and possible exit from the euro zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tsipras has held two hours of talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, but neither side reported any breakthrough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Come in the torture room," Mr Juncker told Mr Tsipras at the start of the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>EU officials later described the talks as a "last attempt" to reach a debt deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>An EU diplomat said the meeting was the result of the IMF's departure from the Greece negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"If the process was working properly the president would not have had to have a meeting with Tsipras today," they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr Tsipras said he had worked on bridging the remaining differences on fiscal and financing issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We are working to assure an agreement which will ensure that Greece will recover with social cohesion and viable public debts," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Late-night talks between Mr Tsipras and the leaders of Germany and France also produced no breakthrough, although German chancellor Angela Merkel said all sides believed they had moved closer on the procedure leading to an agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"At the end of talks there was absolute unanimity that Greece will work intensively and full steam ahead ... in the coming days to solve all remaining issues," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Indeed, all hope may not be lost, as an official close to the negotiations cautioned against excessive pessimism and said the IMF team's departure from Brussels represented a break in the talks rather than a breaking off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>To clinch a deal, EU officials said Mr Tsipras' government needed to offer alternative savings and tax measures to replace proposed pension cuts and tax rises he rejected as "antisocial", to deliver a modest fiscal surplus before interest payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Greek leader faced pressure from both left-wing hardliners and voters, most of whom say they want to remain in the euro zone and want him to make concessions for a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Underlining the resistance Mr Tsipras faced if he gave too much ground, hundreds of supporters of the Communist-affiliated trade union PAME flooded onto an Athens square in a peaceful anti-bailout protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Earlier, they replaced the EU flag with PAME's on the roof of the finance ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>They also draped a banner across five storeys of the ministry which showed two previous prime ministers who each negotiated a deal with the lenders, next to a portrait of Mr Tsipras above the slogan "Bailout Number Three".</td></tr>
