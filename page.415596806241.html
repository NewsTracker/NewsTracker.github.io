<h3>A Year Later, Scars of Deadliest US Landslide Remain Fresh</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But the road it announces is a mere stub of pavement, ending in a massive gray-and-brown scab of mud, clay and broken timber where a rural Washington state neighborhood once sat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A rain-soaked hillside collapsed suddenly on March 22, 2014, sending 18 million tons of sand and soil thundering across a river valley north of Seattle, destroying dozens of homes and entombing 43 people in the deadliest landslide in U.S. history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A year later, as a bill moves through the state legislature to improve mapping of landslide-prone areas and give local planners a better idea of risky development areas, the mangled cars and homes have been cleaned up, but reminders of loss are everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Those thoughts and memories are out there every time you head down the valley," said Dan Rankin, the mayor in nearby Darrington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Yet living with the scarred landscape also reminds them of how they tirelessly searched for victims, of their gratitude for the well-wishes they received and of the millions of dollars in contributions that poured in for housing, counseling and mortgage payments on destroyed properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They take solace in hoping studies of the landslide's unusual behavior - of why it was so much more destructive than others in the area - could help prevent similar tragedies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jonathan Godt, coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey's landslide hazard program, said the disaster is significantly enhancing scientists' understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The key research goal is to identify the basic reasons of why the landslide traveled so far and so fast," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Godt said the USGS hopes that over the next eight years it will be able to chart geologic hazards across the country using advanced technology, but the plan is only partially funded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The state has imposed new rules on logging in landslide-prone areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Families of some victims have alleged in a lawsuit that logging on the hilltop contributed to the slope's instability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Legislature is also addressing measures to clarify emergency response rules, after confusion about whether state firefighting resources could be used for a non-fire emergency delayed their deployment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The slide struck on a clear Saturday morning after weeks of heavy rains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The neighborhood, near the tiny community of Oso, was a development of about 35 single-family homes, some dating to the 1960s, across the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River from a hillside in the Cascade mountains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The river eroded the base of the hill, as it had been doing for decades, causing numerous smaller slides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This time, enough sand and soil to cover 600 football fields 10 feet deep gushed down, sweeping the river up with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A highway was buried under as much as 20 feet of muck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The damage was so vast that it was difficult to comprehend: First responders had trouble getting close enough to take it all in, especially with the hillside continuing to shed and the blocked river rising.</td></tr>

<h3>In Vanuatu, survivors await help as death toll inches up</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australian and French troops arrived on the South Pacific nation's hard-hit island of Tanna, where shaken residents were still waiting for help after their villages were flattened by Cyclone Pam's 270 km per hour winds last Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing figures from Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, upgraded the number of confirmed deaths to 13 from 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Among the dead were seven people from Tafea Province, which includes Tanna, and six from Shefa Province, which includes the main island of Efate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Still, given the immense power of the storm, the relatively low death toll is a testament to the residents' experience in dealing with cyclones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In many villages, people found shelter in special structures built with sturdy walls that can withstand heavy winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Vanuatu's government authorized the distribution of emergency food and water supplies to affected areas, but was still waiting to finish its damage assessment report before beginning a wider distribution of relief items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Some relief supplies have been starting to get there anyway, but the more organized and the larger relief efforts will start tomorrow," said Osnat Lubrani, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The relief has to start coming now, because if it doesn't come in the next two days or so, then we will have problems with food and with water."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Vanuatu is a nation of subsistence farmers, and many people depend on the food they grow to survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The cyclone wiped out gardens, killed livestock and contaminated the water supply in many areas, and agricultural experts estimate that those displaced by the storm will run out of food in less than a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Vanuatu government needs at least $2 million in financial aid to buy supplies and ship them to the worst-hit islands, the U.N. said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The government was asking for donations of enough biscuits, rice and canned protein to help keep islanders' fed through June, when newly-planted crops will be ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A barge carrying food, water and shelter materials arrived on Tanna on Friday and the supplies were being taken to the island's main hospital, said Tom Perry, spokesman for CARE Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Two assessment teams were also planning to reach remote sections of the island on Friday that were reported to have been decimated, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The storm turned Tanna's lush tropical forests into a jumble of broken trunks and strewn branches, and damaged or destroyed at least 80 percent of homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Critically, it also broke water pipes and decimated vegetable patches, cutting off food and water sources for most of the island's 30,000 residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On the eastern side of the island near the belching volcano Yasur, people say the problems are compounded by volcanic ash that the winds spread everywhere, killing the plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tanna resident Patrick George has spent days running around trying to find water, and trudging into the wilderness to collect fallen coconuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The storm destroyed his crops, including bananas and a local variety of potato, and he worries about how he will feed his family when the coconuts run out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Meanwhile, the ash from the volcano has started to make the children cough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Joseph Kamisak, tourism minister for the island's Eastern Province, said many water pipes were broken and the water systems were filled with wood and debris from the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The storm also destroyed many schools in the worst-hit areas, while others are being used as shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Albert Kaukare, principal at Iquaramanu Primary School on Tanna, said people were still sheltering in his school, preventing the students from returning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The cyclone had also ruined the students' supplies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We would like to start but some of our textbooks have all got wet, and everything damaged," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"At the end of this year, the year six students will be sitting exams, and it's important because this will determine whether they move on or they remain. So it's very important that they must start school."</td></tr>
