<h3>No. 11 seed UCLA stuns No. 6 SMU 60-59 on rare 3-pointer (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>11 seed UCLA stuns No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) -- - Bryce Alford's final jumper appeared offline when he let it fly from behind the 3-point arc, and all the UCLA guard could do was helplessly watch the battle for the rebound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>SMU center Yanick Moreira was in position and seemed to time his leap perfectly as he went up to touch it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The officials, however, thought he was a bit too quick and called goaltending, awarding Alford what turned out to be the game-winning basket with 13 seconds left - one that's sure to be among the most debated of this NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Alford had no doubt it was goaltending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I had a pretty good look at it because I shot it,'' Alford said after the 11th-seeded Bruins' 60-59 South Regional victory over sixth-seeded SMU on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''From my angle, I saw Kevon (Looney) and another player going after it, and I was confused because he went up and grabbed it on its way to the rim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Officials went to the monitor to determine it was a 3 and were resolute in their call, telling a pool reporter that the goaltending call wasn't reviewable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>SMU coach Larry Brown couldn't believe it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''We gave the rule number and the article,'' official Sean Hull said in citing Rule 9.3a 1 and 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Under 2 minutes by rule, we have a directive to do that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Said Moreira, ''I think I hit the rim first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I hit the net or the rim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>As replay showed the ball's trajectory, Adams added, ''Again it looks a little bit off to the right, it's touched.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>SMU (27-7) still had two shots to win in the final seconds, but Nic Moore, who scored 24 points, missed a 3-pointer and then a 2-point attempt, sending the Bruins (21-13) into a wild celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>For Alford, it capped an amazing 27-point performance that came on nine 3-pointers including four in the final 3:40.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He certainly did his father and UCLA coach Steve Alford proud being a former sharpshooter himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''He leads us in assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He runs the team for us,'' the elder Alford said, ''and in a game like this, where it was so physical and, I thought, two teams that really fought defensively, he had to make some shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''He's always being compared, obviously, because I played the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>UCLA, meanwhile, offered another example that it's better than its record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Bruins, the team many felt didn't even belong in the field of 68, advanced to Saturday's round of 32 against No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>14 UAB, an upset winner over third-seeded Iowa State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>However, the ending of this game had to be seen to be believed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Before Alford's heroics, SMU's Moore seemed destined to hold that distinction after three 3-pointers keyed a 19-0 run over 6 1/2 minutes to put the Mustangs up by nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>UCLA's leading scorer Norman Powell, who had 19 points, broke the run with a layup and added two free throws that were sandwiched between a series of Alford's shots from behind the arc as he finished 9 of 11 there and 9 of 13 overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Bruins' win was a fitting answer for critics of UCLA's record and tournament worthiness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''It was big motivation,'' said Looney, who had six points and 10 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>''Everybody doubted us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>They said we should not be here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>SMU's first tournament appearance since 1993 meanwhile ended with some players walking around in disbelief and others pounding the court in frustration and disappointment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The loss also spoiled Hall of Famer Brown's first college postseason since leading Kansas to the 1988 title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That it came against a UCLA program he coached to the 1980 championship game before the Bruins lost to Louisville was even more ironic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''It might have been goaltending,'' Brown said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''It probably was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But we've got all these (TV) cameras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It happened so fast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''But, again, give UCLA credit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>UCLA: The Bruins shot 43 percent from the field including 10 of 20 on 3-pointers and outrebounded the Mustangs 34-33.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>... UCLA won despite 18 turnovers which led to 18 points and closed the final 1:05 on an 8-0 run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>SMU: Markus Kennedy added 16 points and nine rebounds for the Mustangs, who finished at 36 percent from the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>UCLA: Faces UAB on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>SMU: Season ends.</td></tr>

<h3>Australian premier takes back his 2nd recent Nazi comparison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>2015 file photo, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott answers questions at a media conference before attending the parliament's question time in Canberra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Australia's gaffe-prone prime minister took back his second Nazi-related comment in a month on Thursday, March 19 after he compared the opposition party leader to German World War II-era propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) - Australia's gaffe-prone prime minister publicly apologized Friday for comparing the opposition party leader to German World War II-era propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels - the second Nazi-related comment he has withdrawn in a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tony Abbott told Parliament on Thursday that Labor Party leader Bill Shorten was "the Dr. Goebbels of economic policy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Abbott immediately said he withdrew the comment, as opposition lawmakers yelled in protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Abbott said in a radio interview on Friday that the remark "shouldn't have been said" and he apologized for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I accept that in the context of history and the way things developed, that was an over-the-top remark," Abbott told Australian Broadcasting Corp. broadcaster Jon Faine, who is Jewish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"All of us from time to time in the heat of debate - and you know how heated the Parliament can get - sometimes go too far. I accept that," Abbott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But Abbott added that at least 11 lawmakers from the Labor Party had made similar references in the past, including Mark Dreyfus - one of only three Jewish lawmakers in Parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Thursday, Speaker Bronwyn Bishop ordered Dreyfus out of the House of Representatives for rising from his seat to angrily berate the prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fellow Labor lawmaker Michael Danby, also Jewish, left the chamber with Dreyfus in solidarity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There are no Nazis here and we shouldn't be making comparisons with the paradigm of the ultimate evil in politics to heighten political differences," Danby told The Associated Press later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's beneath him, and it goes to the question of his judgment. I think a lot of his backbench will be groaning and tearing their hair out," Danby added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dreyfus, who in 2011 described an Abbott political campaign in a newspaper opinion piece as "Goebbellian," described Abbott's reference to the Nazi as inappropriate for a prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, a Jewish member of Abbott's conservative Liberal Party, did not respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Abbott last month apologized to Parliament for describing a 10 percent reduction in defense industry jobs under a former Labor government as a "holocaust of jobs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Peter Wertheim, executive director of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry Inc., an organization representing Jewish community organizations, declined to comment on Thursday because of his council's apolitical stance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But he referred AP to the council's longstanding policy statement that it: "Deplores the inappropriate use of analogies to the Nazi genocide in Australian public debate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Abbott received an unexpected rebuke from the Irish prime minister this week for a St. Patrick's Day video message broadcast online by his Liberal Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Wearing a green tie, Abbott apologized to Ireland because: "I can't be there to share a Guinness or two or maybe even three."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny told the Irish Independent newspaper he had seen Abbott's comments and did not agree with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Kenny told the newspaper he advocated responsible celebrations and rejected "a stage Irish perception."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some of Abbott's government colleagues openly questioned his political judgment in January when he announced on Australia's national day that he had granted Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip an Australian knighthood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The disquiet helped trigger a challenge to his leadership within the ruling Liberal Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>While he survived a no-confidence ballot, his leadership is vulnerable while he remains unpopular in opinion polls.</td></tr>
