<h3>Pakistan sends in troops to prevent more rioting by Christians after Taliban church attacks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The executions are sure to raise concerns over due process and proper oversight of the country's troubled criminal justice system, which rights groups say often does little to protect defendants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Authorities at different jails in the country's largest province of Punjab hanged 10 people Tuesday who had been sentenced to death in murder cases, said the provincial Home Minister Shuja Khanzada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said authorities planned to execute more convicted criminals in the coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We have started a process, and it will continue," he told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The superintendent of the main jail in the southern port city of Karachi, Qazi Nazir, said they executed two convicted murderers and handed the bodies over to their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Late last year, Pakistan's prime minister lifted the death-penalty moratorium specifically for terrorism-related cases after a December Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar killed 150 people, most of them children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last week, in a controversial step, the government completely lifted the death-penalty ban for all cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Human rights groups estimate Pakistan has roughly 8,000 prisoners on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of the most closely watched execution cases is that of Shafqat Hussain, who family members say was 14 when he was sentenced to death by a court in Karachi for the murder of a seven-year-old boy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hussain's family proclaims his innocence and Justice Project Pakistan, the legal group handling his case, says Hussain was tortured into making a false confession.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>The lawyer was killed months after he announced that he will no longer be representing Dr. Shakil Afridi Afridi, who was convicted in May 2012 of "conspiring against the state" by giving money and providing medical treatment to militants, not for helping the CIA track down bin Laden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The lawyer left Pakistan in November after receiving threats from militants; Khan said the lawyer recently came back from abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A spokesman for the Taliban-linked Jamaat-ul-Ahrar group, Ahsanullah Ahsan, claimed responsibility for the killing in a telephone call to The Associated Press from an unidentified location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Dr. Afridi, ran a vaccination campaign in the northwestern city of Abbottabad as a cover for a CIA-backed effort to obtain DNA samples from a home where Osama bin Laden was later killed during a 2011 raid by U.S. Navy SEALs.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>She said Pakistan has assured the U.S. that Dr. Afridi is being treated humanely and is in good health.</td></tr>

<h3>Key players in March 17 Israeli parliamentary election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Netanyahu grudgingly accepted the idea of Palestinian independence in the past but in a dramatic last-minute appeal to hard-line voters Monday, he pledged to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu has also pushed for strong international action against arch-enemy Iran's nuclear facilities and has focused his campaign on security issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>- Zionist Union: The main opposition party and challenger to Netanyahu's lengthy rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Headed by Isaac Herzog, it is a blend between his Labor Party - which governed the country from its founding in 1948 until 1977, and twice since - and former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni's centrist Hatnua party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new alliance has pledged a renewed push for peace with the Palestinians and for mending relations with Israel's most important ally, the United States, which have deteriorated under Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The party has also attacked Netanyahu on economics, blaming him for high housing prices and the economic struggles of the middle class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>- Yesh Atid: Founded by former TV personality Yair Lapid, the centrist party represents secular, middle class interests and focuses mostly on economic issues - saying less money should be spent on settlements and stipends for the ultra-Orthodox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The party was the surprise of the previous vote in 2013 and then joined Likud as its senior coalition partner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The charismatic Lapid saw his popularity drop as finance minister but has recovered since Netanyahu fired him in December and called the new election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The party has attacked Netanyahu as out of touch with average Israelis, but hasn't ruled out cooperating with him again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>- Kulanu: The new party headed by former Likud government minister Moshe Kahlon is shaping up to be the kingmaker of this election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Kahlon is running on an economic platform that deals almost exclusively with bread-and-butter issues, while all but ignoring Israel's diplomatic challenges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He is demanding to become finance minister in the next government and could tip the scales in favor of either Netanyahu or Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kahlon, the son of Libyan immigrants, is popular with working class Israelis thanks to his Middle Eastern background, his modest upbringing and for reforming the local mobile-phone market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>- The Joint List: A recently established alliance of four small, largely Arab-backed parties representing Israel's 20-percent Arab minority that could emerge as the third-largest bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Despite deep differences between socialists, Palestinian nationalists and traditional Islamists, the list's leader, 40-year-old lawyer Ayman Odeh, says the unprecedented union could dramatically increase Arab turnout at the polls and clout in Israel's parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>- Yisrael Beitenu: The far-right secular party headed by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman takes a hard line against Israel's Arab minority and says it will push for the death penalty for terrorists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The party has shrunk in the polls since breaking up an alliance with Likud and following a series of corruption scandals that forced out several key players.</td></tr>
