<h3>James Holmes' Insanity Plea Challenged as Trial Begins</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The opening statements of the trial of James Holmes, seen far left, who is accused of killing twelve people and wounding over 70 at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo, is seen in this grab taken on April 27, 2015 in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The prosecution launched into its opening statements in the Aurora movie theater shooting trial today, with the district attorney laying out how shooter James Holmes was declared sane by multiple state-appointed doctors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>New details about the shooting were also revealed during the first day of the court case, including how Holmes scoped out various theaters and rated them based on the number of possible exits, and how he blasted techno music in his headphones during the shooting, according to prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Holmes also apparently took a Vicodin before leaving for the theater, the district attorney said, because he feared he would get injured during the shooting and the medication would lessen the pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, meaning he acknowledges killing 12 and injuring 70 others during the July 2012 shooting but believes he was not sane at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>District Attorney George Brauchler took that claim to task in the prosecution's opening statements, highlighting the judgment that came from two psychiatrists who spent 50 hours with Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Both of them said the same thing: that that guy was sane when he tried to murder all those people in the theater back in July of 2012," Brauchler said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At one point, Brauchler shows Holmes speaking during an interview with a different doctor where Holmes is heard saying the wounded were "collateral damage" and "I only count fatalities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If he is found not guilty by reason of insanity, he would be committed indefinitely to a state mental institution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But if he were later deemed sane, he could, theoretically, be released, though legal experts say that is unlikely.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>PHOTO: In this July 23, 2012, file photo, James E. Holmes appears in Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Throughout his two-hour opening statement, Brauchler gave brief descriptions of some of the shooter's 12 victims, with their photos shown on a screen for the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At one point, he showed surveillance footage from the concession stand of 6-year-old victim Veronica Moser who died after being shot four times by Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>One 911 call was played for the court and unused rounds of ammunition were held up by Brauchner as he described what was found in Holmes' getaway vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Brauchler also detailed Holmes' extensive meetings with university therapists, whom he told about his homicidal thoughts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The court was read a litany of emails that Holmes exchanged with his parents, his texts with girlfriends, and his pet gerbil named Lucifer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The district attorney went through chronologically each of Holmes' ammunition and gun purchases, showing how he used his credit card that his parents could not access and made the various purchases at multiple weapons shops that Brauchler said was done to avoid detection by any one shopkeeper.</td></tr>
