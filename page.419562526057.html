<h3>Packers lose WR Jordy Nelson for the season to injury (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Green Bay Packers' worst fears about the severity of receiver Jordy Nelson's knee injury have come true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The team said Monday only that the star receiver suffered a ''significant right knee injury'' that would cost him the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nelson, one of the top targets for NFL MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers, was injured Sunday in a preseason game at Pittsburgh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It's difficult to lose a guy like that in a meaningless game,'' Rodgers said after the 24-19 loss to the Steelers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Coach Mike McCarthy was hoping for better results from more tests on Nelson's knee in Green Bay on the team's' off day on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Rodgers' somber tone after the game foreshadowed the bad news for one of the league's best offenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Packers, one of the top contenders in the NFC, will be without a playmaker who set career highs in receptions (98) and yards receiving (1,519) in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nelson had 13 touchdown catches last year and 43 over the last four seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He and Randall Cobb formed one of the top receiving duos in the league, each catching more than 90 passes last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nelson is also one of the most respected veterans in the locker room for his leadership and work ethic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While limited during the offseason following minor hip surgery, Nelson could often be found with a play sheet in hand and offering tips to younger receivers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Jordy Nelson is a key member of our football program both on the field and of the field, probably more so off the field,'' McCarthy said in Pittsburgh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Packers have depth at receiver, but lack experience after Cobb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Promising second-year player Davante Adams, who has had a good offseason and training camp, moves up as the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>2 receiver behind Cobb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Rookie Ty Montgomery, who has impressed so far in practice, moves up to third receiver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Myles White, who played seven games with the Packers in 2013, has also had a good camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The 6-foot-3 Jeff Janis, a second-year player, has size but has been inconsistent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jared Abbrederis has been sidelined by a concussion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''Whether (Nelson is) here or not, guys have to step up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And I'm one of those guys who has to be ready for anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>An opportunity is always going to be there, no matter what else is going on,'' Rodgers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But no one has the kind of rapport that Nelson, entering his eight season, has cultivated with Rodgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He has developed a knack for making seemingly impossible catches along the sideline and catching deep balls from Rodgers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It's that skill that made Nelson and Cobb such a formidable duo, with Cobb often able to get open over the middle for big third-down plays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The emergence of second-year tight end Richard Rodgers, who has also stood out in camp, could help ease the loss of Nelson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Packers also have one of the best offensive lines in the league and punishing running back Eddie Lacy.</td></tr>
