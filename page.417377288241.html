<h3>FIFA should air dirty laundry: Australia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Australia has called on Sepp Blatter to immediately air FIFA's dirty laundry as soccer braces for more arrests in its unprecedented corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two days after 14 people were arrested on corruption charges, Blatter won a fifth term as president of soccer's disgraced governing body at a vote in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Football Federation Australia voted against Blatter, a move at odds with its overseeing Asian Football Confederation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Asia and Africa effectively re-elected Blatter, who fell seven votes short of the required 140 majority in the first round of voting but won when challenger Prince Ali bin al Hussein withdrew before a second round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FFA chairman Frank Lowy, who backed Prince Ali, shared consternation in Europe and America about Blatter's re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He was very clear in acknowledging that FIFA faced a real challenge to restore its standing and Australia will play its role along with other associations to try to achieve this," Lowy said in a statement on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The vote secured by Prince Ali was not insignificant and reflects a belief within FIFA and the world football community that governance and other reforms need to be implemented as soon as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>After winning the vote, Blatter, 79, raised his arms in triumph and promised to be the "commander" who "guides this boat FIFA" out of the corruption turmoil into which it has sunk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I promise a strong FIFA, I want to climb back up the hill, arrange FIFA's situation. I want a beautiful, robust FIFA, out of the storm," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Blatter was shunned by Europe, whose 53 votes mainly went to Prince Ali, along with Australia's and the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>UEFA president Michel Platini, who had asked Blatter to quit, said change in FIFA was crucial "if this organisation is to regain its credibility".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Blatter's re-election came as a top US federal investigator in the FIFA corruption scandal said he was "fairly confident" of more arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Richard Weber, leader of the US Internal Revenue Service criminal investigations unit, would not say if Blatter was among the targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We strongly believe there are other people and entities involved in criminal acts," he told the New York Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>US authorities two days ago charged 14 people, including nine current or former FIFA officials, with bribery and kickback schemes involving tens of millions of dollars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Seven FIFA officials, including two vice-presidents, were arrested in dawn raids at a luxury Zurich hotel ahead of the FIFA congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I don't think there was ever a decision or a declaration that we would go after soccer," Weber said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We were going after corruption. One thing led to another, led to another and another."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Swiss police have also started a fresh investigation into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar after bids surrounded by corruption claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Australia spent $46 million bidding to host the 2022 cup but gained just one vote of support in a process unexpectedly won by Qatar.</td></tr>
