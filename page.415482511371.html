<h3>Prayers for elderly Indian nun gang-raped</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Thousands are expected to join a rally led by priests in India's Kolkata in support of a 71-year-old nun who was gang-raped at her convent school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The rape by a gang of robbers late on Friday is the latest in a series of high-profile sexual assaults in India that have intensified outrage over high levels of violence against women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We expect three to four thousand people to attend the rally. In fact we have asked all the city parishes to join the rally," Archbishop of Kolkata Thomas D'Souza said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We also expect common people to participate and express their solidarity to the victim."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The archbishop stressed the rally was not aimed at condemning any political party over the attack, which comes amid concern in India's Christian community at a spate of recent attacks mostly on churches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Priests and other Christian leaders have blamed those attacks on religious hardliners who have become emboldened since Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept to power at general elections last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>D'Souza said hymns and prayers for the nun would be encouraged at the rally, which would culminate in a candlelit vigil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The nun, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was attacked after the robbers ransacked the convent school at Ranaghat, 70 kilometres from Kolkata, and stole cash and other items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The woman, who needed surgery from injuries suffered during the attack, is recovering in hospital in Ranaghat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The incident adds to a grim record of sexual assaults in India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It comes amid raging debate over the banning of a documentary about a December 2012 gang-rape in New Delhi that sparked national and international outrage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The attack has also intensified fears among the Christian minority after a series of vandalism and arson attacks on institutions mostly in Delhi since December.</td></tr>
