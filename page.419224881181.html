<h3>Fragments from MH17 site possibly linked to Russian-made missile: Dutch prosecutors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 which was shot down by a surface to air missile in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Investigators probing the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 say they have identified pieces of debris "possibly" from a Russian-made BUK missile from eastern Ukraine, where the plane crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>International and Dutch investigators are probing "several parts, possibly originating from a BUK surface-air-missile system," a joint statement from prosecutors and the Dutch Safety Board (OVV) said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"These parts have been secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine and are in possession of the criminal investigation team MH17 and the Dutch Safety Board," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Malaysia Airlines MH17 crashed over territory held by pro-Russian rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 aboard, mostly Dutch citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ukraine and many in the West have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they may have used a BUK missile supplied by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russia and the rebels denied any responsibility and point the finger at Ukraine's military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Members of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) comprising representatives from the Netherlands, Ukraine, Malaysia, Australia, Britain, the United States and Russia are currently meeting in The Hague to discuss a draft OVV report into what caused the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The statement from the OVV and JIT said that the pieces being investigated "can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts. The JIT will internationally enlist the help of experts, among others forensic specialists and weapon-experts," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Investigators stressed that "at present, the conclusion cannot be drawn that there is a causal connection between the discovered parts and the crash of flight MH17".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Last month, Russia vetoed a bid at the United Nations Security Council to set up an international tribunal to try those behind the downing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Countries involved in that bid are now looking at other means to carry out a prosecution, although no suspects have yet been publicly identified or detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The OVV is to release its final report into what, but not who, downed the aircraft in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One year on, what's next for Ukraine, Russia and the US?</td></tr>
