<h3>Australian lawyer to be interviewed over Bali nine judge bribery claim</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Explosive claims: Muhammad Rifan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jakarta: The Indonesian judicial commission investigating explosive claims the Bali nine judges were corrupt says it will meet with one of the executed men's former lawyers, Peter Johnson, in Bali this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Commission investigators will also attempt to interview another of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan's former lawyers, Muhammad Rifan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Rifan sensationally claimed the judges who sentenced the Bali nine pair to death asked for more than $130,000 in exchange for a prison term of less than 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One of many Bali nine appeals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However Mr Rifan has refused to testify before the judicial commission, claiming there is no point now the Australians are dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Commissioner Imam Anshori Saleh disagreed it was pointless to pursue the bribery allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think the case is still necessary to be investigated because it is about law enforcement and ethics concerning the judges," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This case is not dealing with the two guys who are dead now, it is necessary because it's concerning the panel of judges who are still alive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Imam said Mr Johnson had agreed to meet with investigators but Mr Rifan had not responded to a letter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Hopefully he will receive us," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Johnson declined to comment and Fairfax Media was unable to contact Mr Rifan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Fairfax Media revealed Mr Rifan's sensational bribery allegations shortly before Sukumaran and Chan were executed on April 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A deal had allegedly fallen through after the judges told Mr Rifan they had been ordered by senior legal and government members in Jakarta to impose the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The two were killed by firing squad for their role in the aborted attempt to import more than eight kilograms of heroin into Australia in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Rifan has come under intense pressure over the allegations and was rumoured earlier this month to have been arrested following police questioning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He later denied he had been arrested or was facing further police questioning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>However asked last month if he would testify before the judicial commission, Mr Rifan said: "I don't want to comment on this case anymore, I don't see the urgency."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mr Imam said the investigators would hold meetings on June 3 and 4 in Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There is an article in the judicial commission law that says we have the rights to force people to come to us in the case they ignore the warrants," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Right now I can't say if we will exercise our right to force him, it depends on what will happen in Bali."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Imam said the judicial commission would decide whether to summon the panel of judges after questioning Mr Johnson and hopefully Mr Rifan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"If everything goes well this case can be settled within one month," he said.</td></tr>
