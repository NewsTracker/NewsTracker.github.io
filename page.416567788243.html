<h3>Republicans reach deal for budget plan, target Obamacare</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican budget negotiators on Monday reached a compromise deal for the first joint House-Senate budget in six years, one that seeks to boost military spending while calling for deep cuts to social programs to eliminate deficits in a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But congressional aides said the deal, to be formally unveiled on Tuesday, will stop well short of directing appropriations committees to actually implement those cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Instead, it will focus on the use of budget procedural tools on repealing or replacing President Barack Obama's signature health reform legislation, the aides said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Passing a budget will allow Republicans the opportunity to use budget "reconciliation" procedures to dismantle "Obamacare" with only a simple majority vote in the Senate, rather than a near-impossible 60 vote margin that would require some Democratic support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As reported by Reuters last week, the compromise budget will exclude Representative Paul Ryan's longstanding proposals to convert the Medicare health program for seniors to a system of subsidies for largely private health insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The House of Representatives had included the Medicare reforms in its budget for a fifth straight year, calling for the changes to start in 2024.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the more cautious Senate did not include the proposals, adopting similar savings goals for the program as Obama proposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Republican budget will nominally maintain statutory "sequester" spending caps for the military and domestic federal agencies for the 2016 fiscal year starting Oct. 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But at the same time it skirts the caps by providing an additional $38 billion in military spending via a special off-budget account for war operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The final language is expected to drop Senate language that would have required such war funding to be offset with other savings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While the budget will help guide the process of crafting spending bills for the next fiscal year, most of it is non-binding and represents a policy manifesto for Republicans who now control both chambers of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Once the budget is passed, the fiscal debate will shift to a separate effort to find other savings or revenue increases to ease the sequester spending constraints that were enacted in a 2011 budget law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>If Congress fails to lift the spending caps, military and domestic agency spending next year would stay flat at about $1 trillion, the same level as a decade ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>This also would make passage of spending bills more difficult, raising the risk of a government shutdown on Oct. 1.</td></tr>
