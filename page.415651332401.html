<h3>Israeli president calls for healing after divisive election</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rivlin serves a mostly ceremonial role and he has positioned himself as a unifier since taking office last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One of his few actual powers is being able to choose the person with the best chances of putting together a coalition government after elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Throughout a close election campaign it looked like he would have a crucial role to play after the vote but a resounding victory by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party has made his considerations mostly moot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Sunday, Rivlin began his consultation with all the parties in parliament to hear their recommendations before he officially tasks Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rivlin used the platform to call for unity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a last-ditch attempt to spur his supporters to the polls last week, Netanyahu warned that Arab citizens were voting "in droves" and endangering years of rule by his right-wing Likud Party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The comments drew accusations of racism from Israeli Arabs and a White House rebuke about the divisive language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Alluding to the uproar, Rivlin told Likud representatives that the emerging government will have to serve "all the citizens of Israel, Jews and Arabs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We have been through a stormy and passionate election period -- this is the time to begin a process of mending and healing in Israeli society," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Netanyahu's Likud won the election by capturing 30 seats in the 120-member parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It looks to have a relatively easy time putting together a 61-seat majority along with its nationalist and religious allies.</td></tr>
