<h3>FIFA sets date for 2026 World Cup hosting bid rules</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GENEVA (AP) - A 2026 World Cup hosting contest which could include the United States and exclude Europe will take shape next week when FIFA agrees on campaign rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FIFA said Tuesday that its executive committee will approve bidding regulations at a two-day meeting starting Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter said last week "it should be" that a continental confederation cannot bid for the next two World Cups after hosting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Russia will stage the 2018 tournament, leaving UEFA members next eligible for the 2030 tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is more than an option," Blatter told reporters last week when asked if FIFA could tighten the continental rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Currently, the FIFA statutes only prevent confederations from hosting back-to-back World Cups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FIFA will choose the 2026 host in a May 2017 vote of all member federations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That reform was passed after the executive committee's controversial choice of Russia and 2022 host Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Gulf emirate beat the American bid 14-8 in a final round of voting in December 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The nine-candidate bidding contests for 2018 and 2022 were marred by allegations of wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some claims were examined by the FIFA ethics committee before the vote and the entire process was later investigated by former U.S. federal prosecutor Michael Garcia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He resigned last December in protest at FIFA's handling of his work and ethics judge Joachim Eckert's assessment that any wrongdoing did not influence the voting results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In March, FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke promised greater scrutiny of candidates in the new bidding rules.</td></tr>
