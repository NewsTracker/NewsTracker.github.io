<h3>US House committee subpoenas Clinton emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The subpoenas issued Wednesday indicate Republicans want questions about Hillary Rodham Clinton's use of a private email account to follow her into a widely anticipated second presidential campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Republicans, who control the investigative powers of Congress, say the revelations reaffirm their long-held portrayal of Bill and Hillary Clinton as secretive and playing by their own rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Democrats dismiss the accusations as trivial, but they were fast becoming a distraction for Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The American people deserve all of the facts," Republican House Speaker John Boehner said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Congressman Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, intends to investigate whether Clinton, by using a personal email account, may have violated federal requirements that written communications of officials are preserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Democrats question whether the emails will resonate with voters in an election 20 months away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But as the presidential nominating season begins, Clinton's use of a personal email account for State Department business has stoked questions about transparency that threaten to cloud her early steps as the Democratic Party's overwhelming favorite White House prospect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The subpoenas from the Republican-led Select Committee on the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, demanded additional material from Clinton and others, spokesman Jamal D. Ware said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The panel also instructed technology companies it did not identify to preserve any relevant documents in their possession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The questions follow recent reports about the Clinton family foundation's raising of money from foreign governments, while she was the country's top diplomat, to benefit the nonprofit's philanthropic mission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The development at Congress came the same day AP reported the existence of a personal email server traced back to the Chappaqua, New York, home of Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official running her own email server would have given Clinton significant control over limiting access to her message archives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The practice also would complicate the State Department's legal responsibilities in finding and turning over official emails in response to any investigations, lawsuits or public records requests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The department would be in the position of accepting Clinton's assurances she was surrendering everything required that was in her control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Congress said it learned last summer about Clinton's use of a private email account to conduct official State Department business during its investigation of the Benghazi attacks on a U.S. mission in which four Americans died, including the ambassador to Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Democrats called it a fishing expedition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They say the latest probes are throwbacks to the 1990s when they say Republicans overplayed their hands pursuing President Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The questions about Clinton's email practices left the Obama administration in an awkward position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At one point, the State Department directed reporters to contact Clinton, who has not publicly commented about her emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The White House said it was her responsibility to make sure any emails about official business weren't deleted from her private server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meanwhile, the AP said it was considering legal action against the State Department for failing to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the top U.S. diplomat after waiting more than one year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The department has never suggested that it doesn't possess all Clinton's emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the department will review for release the emails Clinton provided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We will undertake this review as quickly as possible; given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete," Harf said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Clinton " who emailed so frequently using her BlackBerry as secretary of state that it became an Internet meme " is particularly sensitive about disclosures of personal files based on her experiences in confronting congressional investigations and civil lawsuits during her husband's election and presidency and her own roles as first lady, senator, presidential candidate and Cabinet official.</td></tr>

<h3>After Ebola ban, N. Korea opens marathon to foreigners</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TOKYO (AP) - After lifting travel restrictions it imposed because of concerns over the Ebola virus, North Korea says foreigners can now take part in one of its most popular tourist events - the annual Pyongyang marathon, a travel agency said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Even though no cases of Ebola had been reported anywhere near North Korea, the country shut out foreign tourists in October with some of the strictest Ebola regulations in the world, including saying that only local runners would be allowed into the marathon in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Uri Tours, one company that takes tourists into North Korea, said on its website Thursday that it had been informed that North Korean authorities had "decided to re-open the doors to foreign amateur runners for the 2015 Pyongyang Marathon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier this week North Korea lifted its restrictions on travelers that virtually closed its borders to foreigners last October, halting all non-essential visas and requiring those few foreigners allowed in to undergo three weeks of quarantine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The rules applied to diplomats, NGO workers and even senior North Korean officials returning from overseas trips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Uri Tours statement said that registration for the April 12 race had been extended to March 20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last year's race through the streets of Pyongyang, including a 10-kilometer (6-mile) competition and a half marathon along with the full course, was opened up to foreign recreational runners for the first time and was a big success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Elite runners from around the world are usually brought in for the main event, but it was not immediately known if there is enough time to arrange that this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Known officially as the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, the race is sanctioned as a bronze-label event by the International Association of Athletics Federations and has been held annually for 27 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It is held in conjunction with a series of sporting competitions, arts festivals and cultural events marking the birthday of North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung, on April 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>North Korea has made a concerted effort to bolster its tourist trade in recent years by setting up special tourism zones and developing scenic areas and recreational facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tens of thousands of Chinese tourists visit each year, according to Koryo Tours, another company running trips into North Korea, while tourists from other countries are rarer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>North Korean media have suggested Ebola was created by the U.S. military as a biological weapon.</td></tr>
