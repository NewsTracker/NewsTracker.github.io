<h3>'Macbeth' to 'Mad Max' set to invade Cannes Film Festival</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Workers place a banner depicting actress Ingrid Bergman on the Palais during preparations for the 68th international film festival in Cannes, southern France, Monday, May 11, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The festival runs from May 13 to May 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - There will be no selfies on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but, rest assured, there will be every other type of image-making at the French Riviera extravaganza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Photographers will form flashing gauntlets through which many of the top stars and filmmakers in movies will stream on their way to premiering hotly anticipated films on screens that are less theaters than movie cathedrals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nowhere are films and filmmakers taken more seriously or superficially than at Cannes, the Cote d'Azur capital of cinema, which kicks off its 68th annual edition Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's a circus," says Todd Haynes, ("Mildred Pierce," ''I'm Not There"), who will premiere his 1950s lesbian melodrama "Carol," starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It's a mad beast like nothing else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nothing compares to Cannes, in my experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At this year's festival, Haynes is one of two American filmmakers among the illustrious films in competition for the Palme d'Or.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Cannes top honor has occasionally gone to American directors (Francis Ford Coppola, Quentin Tarantino), including this year's jury heads: Joel and Ethan Coen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>(They won in 1991 for "Barton Fink."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's only me and Gus Van Sant, who is also a gay Portlander, that are U.S. representatives," says Haynes, speaking from his home in Portland, Oregon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I wrote him as soon as I saw that we were officially included."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But if the American contingent is narrow in neighborly proximity, this year's festival is otherwise striking for its international breadth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>More than ever, the movies in competition at Cannes are international productions, shot on sets that could easily pass for United Nations assemblies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Italian stylist Paolo Sorrentino will present his follow-up to the Oscar-winning "The Great Beauty": "Youth," an Alps-set drama in English, starring Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Joachim Trier, the Norwegian filmmaker of "Oslo, August 31," will also premiere an English-language drama, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Gabriel Byrne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Sicario," a Mexican border crime drama starring Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro, is the latest from the Quebec director Denis Villeneuve ("Prisoners").</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Even a multi-national Shakespeare will come to Cannes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Macbeth," by the Australian director Justin Kurzel, stars the Irish, German-born Michael Fassbender and the French Marion Cotillard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Fassbender was thoroughly impressed by Cotillard tackling Lady Macbeth in a second language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I can't speak highly enough of her," Fassbender says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"For me to take it on, it was, 'OK, Shakespeare.' But she's French speaking. I just thought it was incredible bravery. And she's excellent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Stranger, surreal pairings are also in the offing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Tale of Tales," by the Italian director Matteo Garrone ("Gomorrah"), is loosely based on 17th century fairy tales, and its trailer promises the sight of Salma Hayek eating the heart of a beast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The Lobster," from the Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos ("Dogtooth"), is about a future where those unable to find a mate are turned into animals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It stars Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Who plays the lobster is anyone's guess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Cannes if a fitting home for such international oddities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It's by far the largest movie market in the world, and while most will be eyeing the happenings along the red carpet at the Palais, the luxury hotels up and down the Croisette and the yachts moored offshore will be frantic with deal-making.</td></tr>
