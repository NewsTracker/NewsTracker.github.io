<h3>Stocks slip, euro near 2-month high as US economy loses steam</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TOKYO, April 30 (Reuters) - Asian stocks stumbled on Thursday while the euro held near two-month highs against the dollar after surprisingly downbeat first quarter economic growth in the United States dimmed the mood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The disappointing news on the world's biggest economy, coming on top of a worrying slowdown in China, found expression in a warning by New Zealand's central bank that it could cut rates if domestic momentum weakened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Japan's Nikkei shed 1.9 percent and South Korean, Australian, Chinese and Hong Kong shares also suffered losses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The drop in Asian equities followed Wednesday's slide in U.S and European stocks, with Germany's DAX - which hit a record high earlier this month - tumbling 3.2 percent on the euro's surge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Risk has been building in the markets for weeks - the mass account openings in China, the rally in Europe as the ECB ploughs on with its 65 billion euro a month QE program," said Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The U.S. economy grew just 0.2 percent in the first quarter, down sharply from the previous quarter's 2.2 percent growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The disappointing data further dimmed already faint prospects for an interest rate hike in June by the Federal Reserve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If the U.S. was the main source of the slowdown in Asian export growth in the first quarter we should see growth start to accelerate," analysts at ING wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The euro was little changed at $1.1119 after surging to a near two-month high of $1.1188 in the wake of the data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A rise in euro zone debt yields also helped the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>German Bund yields posted their biggest daily rise in two years overnight on waning deflation fears and improved prospects for a Greek debt deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The common currency shed some of its gains after investors focused on the Fed's monetary policy statement attributing the winter slowdown in U.S. economic growth partly to transitory factors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Fed, however, took a dimmer view of the labour market after its two-day policy meeting ended late Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"All in all, the FOMC statement gave a balanced assessment of the current economic slowdown and the Committee remains very much in a data-dependent mode. However, the balanced and cautious tone in the statement is a far cry from the optimism and (over)confidence that we have seen in previous statements," economists at Rabobank wrote in a note to clients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 118.87 yen after a choppy session overnight which took it to between a low of 118.60 and a high of 119.36.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A rise in yields on U.S. Treasuries, which saw the benchmark 10-year note's yield climb to a six-week high overnight amid a global bond sell-off, helped shore up the dollar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The New Zealand dollar sank 0.8 percent to $0.7618 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand stood pat on monetary policy and said it would cut rates if warranted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The kiwi's retreat pushed the Australian dollar down 0.3 percent to $0.7988 after it marched to a three-month peak of $0.8077 overnight on the dollar's broad weakness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In commodities, U.S. crude extended gains after jumping to a four-month high overnight when the first crude stock draw in five months at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub suggested the oil glut may be starting to wane.</td></tr>
