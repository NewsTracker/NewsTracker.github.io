<h3>NASA's Dawn spacecraft goes into orbit around Ceres</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NASA 'exhilarated' as Dawn orbits mini-planet Ceres NASA engineers said Friday they are "exhilarated" by the final maneuver in a 7 1/2 year "celestial dance" that put the spacecraft Dawn into orbit around the mini-planet Ceres 310 million miles from Earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NASA's Dawn spacecraft is set to observe the mini-planet Ceres until at least mid-2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But this isn't the first trip Dawn has taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This Feb. 19, 2015 file image provided by NASA shows the dwarf planet Ceres, taken by the space agency's Dawn spacecraft from a distance of nearly 29,000 miles (46,000 kilometers).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Friday, March 6, 2015, NASAis Dawn spacecraft arrives at the mysterious dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter after a nearly eight-year journey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At 7:39 a.m., EST, as the spacecraft, trailing a beam of blue-green vapor, closed in on the dwarf planet, Ceres "reached out and tenderly took the newcomer from Earth into its permanent gravitational embrace," said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in his Dawn Blog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This beautifully choreographed celestial dance is now a pas de deux," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>From its launch in September, 2007, Dawn has traveled 3.1 billion miles to reach Ceres in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We feel exhilarated," said Chris Russell, principal investigator of the mission at UCLA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We have much to do over the next year and a half, but we are now on station with ample reserves, and a robust plan to obtain our science objectives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jim Green, the director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, said Dawn's mission "allows us to look back in time to see how terrestrial planets are put together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The crucial radio signal that arrived at JPL at 8:36 a.m. EST confirmed that Dawn was healthy and thrusting with its ion engine, the indicator it had entered orbit as planned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Since its discovery in 1801, Ceres was known as a planet, then an asteroid and later a dwarf planet," said Rayman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Now, after a journey of 3.1 billion miles and 7.5 years, Dawn calls Ceres, home."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Dawn offered it's own assessment via Twitter: "Confirmed: I am in orbit around #Ceres."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The spacecraft then almost immediately swung behind the the dark side of the mini-planet and won't be able to deliver images until April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Its first science orbit will take place April 23 with an altitude of 8,400 miles above Ceres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Its final orbit will take it 230 miles above the surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Dawn's job is to tell all about Ceres, which was discovered more than 200 years ago but has let slip very little about itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Does it have polar ice caps?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Does it have a liquid ocean?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And could it have once harbored - or could it still harbor -- life?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>NASA's Dawn spacecraft slipped into orbit around Ceres on Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Dawn's job is to tell all about the mini-planet, discovered more than 200 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The biggest question is, of course, could Ceres harbor life?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The planet has been like "your secretive neighbor. Ceres would tell us nothing," said Russell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Everything we're seeing was unexpected."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Among the most unexpected sights are the two astonishingly bright spots nestled in a crater on Ceres's surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Photographed by Dawn's camera Feb. 19, the dots have the experts buzzing with speculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Maybe a direct hit from an asteroid -- a space rock - excavated some buried ice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Maybe the bright spots are a sheen of minerals deposited by gushing geysers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The spots "are unique in the solar system," Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator of the Dawn mission said at a NASA briefing Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"The mystery will be solved, but it's really got us at the edge of our seats."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Like the big boys of the solar system, Ceres first took shape some 4-1/2 billion years ago from gas and dust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Unlike the true planets, Ceres froze in a state of arrested development, never growing beyond roughly a third the size of our moon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Ceres "made it to the last rank before planet," says planetary scientist Andy Rivkin of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, who has studied the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"The planets formed out of things that were Ceres-sized."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Ceres, he says, can teach us what it takes to build an object such as the icy moons adorning some of the solar system's bigger planets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Though it's not a full-fledged planet, Ceres does merit the consolation title of "dwarf planet," a title awarded to round bodies that, though big, are too small to make everything else get out of their way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Ceres is one of only known five dwarf planets - Pluto is another - and the first to host an orbiting spacecraft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>NASA posted a video shot from the ISS that show aurora touching the light from a sunrise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>A total solar eclipse in the North Atlantic and tips to prepare for the next U.S. eclipse.</td></tr>

<tr><td>81</td><td>Jen Markham (@jenmarkham) explains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Scientists know that Ceres once had an icy ocean at its core and probably still does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>But it's also possible that radioactivity inside the planet melted some of the ice, creating a lake or a sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Dawn will look for a liquid ocean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>If it's there, says Dawn science team member Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, that "raises the question, if water equals life, could life have evolved under the surface of Ceres?"</td></tr>

<tr><td>94</td><td>Inventive engineering got the spacecraft back on its feet, and it's now expected to collect even more data at Ceres than originally planned, Rayman says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>When it starts to orbit Ceres, Dawn will become the first spacecraft in history to orbit two extraterrestrial objects, a feat impossible without its high-tech propulsion system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>Like the TIE fighters in "Star Wars," Dawn is powered by so-called ion engines, which rely on electrically charged atoms called ions to push the craft ahead.</td></tr>

<tr><td>98</td><td>Dawn will study Ceres until at least mid-2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>The official end of its mission has not yet been determined.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali nine executions: Indonesia can't be sure it will be this month as other drug felons appeal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The executions of 10 drug felons on death row in Indonesia are waiting on the outcomes of legal appeals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo has previously been adamant that all legal avenues had been exhausted for the 10 prisoners - including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - after the Indonesian president rejected their clemency pleas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However in a major departure, the Attorney-General's spokesman Tony Spontana said one of the felons was requesting a judicial review of her case and the government "had to respect the ongoing legal process".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Spontana said he couldn't be sure the prisoners would be executed this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Filipino woman Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, who was caught smuggling 2.6 kilograms of heroin into Yogyakarta, has had her application for a judicial review referred to the Supreme Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Frenchman Serge Atloui, who was arrested at an ecstasy laboratory in Tangerang in 2005, has also requested a judicial review of his case which will be held on March 11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sources told Fairfax Media that reports the executions would be delayed indefinitely were inaccurate and the Indonesian government was merely waiting on the outcome of court cases scheduled for next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meanwhile Chan and Sukumaran have spent three lonely days at Nusakambangan, with their families so far blocked from visiting them on the penal island where Indonesia's government plans to execute them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Refusing to show any latitude to the emotionally battered families, Indonesian officials are saying they can only see the pair between 9am and 1pm on Mondays and Wednesdays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Australian consular staff are negotiating for some leniency but the head of the Central Java justice office, Mirza Zukarnain, said there could be no compromise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"No exception. We can't make allowances for certain families only. It won't be fair for the others," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The stand-off comes as Indonesian President Joko Widodo insisted there were "no problems" with its relationship with Australia, despite outrage at the extraordinary military and police operation to transfer the reformed drug smugglers to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We are still good friends, good neighbours but the death penalty is our legal sovereignty," Mr Joko told reporters in East Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop described the "disproportionate" transfer of Chan and Sukumaran and the release of photos showing them with a smiling Bali police chief as "undignified and degrading" on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It seems that our citizens have been singled out for treatment designed to maximise publicity that was certainly at odds with the treatment of other citizens of other countries in the same position," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dozens of heavily armed police and military personnel accompanied Chan and Sukumaran duo during the transfer, while hundreds more secured roads and airports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sukhoi fighters jets shadowed the plane that carried them from Bali to Central Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Other drug felons due to be executed were transferred in a far more low key fashion, often in just a single prison van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Australian government ministers have described their treatment as "macabre".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Spontana defended the militarised operation, saying it was required "to ensure a smooth transfer".</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Foreign Affairs deputy secretary Greg Moriarty, who was Australia's ambassador in Jakarta until last year, spoke with ambassador Nadjib Riphat Kesoema on Thursday night to register Australia's displeasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Ms Bishop intends to meet with the ambassador next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells on Besi prison, or iron prison, one of seven jails on Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They are incarcerated in separate cells but can call out to each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They have no contact with other inmates at the prison other than Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, who is also due to be slated for death by firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>On Friday morning, the men's lawyer, Julian McMahon, and Australia's consul-general to Bali, Majell Hind, pushed through a frenzied media mob and anti-drugs protesters to board the ferry to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It is understood Chan and Sukumaran are being treated well and are in good spirits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>They are reportedly looking forward to their family's visit on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Anti-drug demonstrators marched to the ferry dock singing the Indonesian national anthem and carrying a grisly post wrapped in sheets with a face scrawled with coloured pen, made to resemble a corpse wrapped in a traditional Muslim shroud for burial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The shroud, known as kain kafan in Indonesian, is the prescribed length of cloth used in Muslim burials to wrap the body of a dead person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>They urged that the Australians be shot and carried signs saying "We love Indonesia. Save Indonesia generation" and "Go to hell".</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The scenes came as Indonesia flagged a delay in the duo's pair's execution of up to 10 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The pause should give their lawyers time to pursue a legal appeal lodged on Monday with the state administrative court in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The action is the second attempt to challenge the rejection of Bali nine drug smugglers clemency pleas by Mr Joko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Lawyers for the pair say Mr Joko rebuffed Chan and Sukumaran's petition for mercy without properly considering their specific circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>With the guidance of prison staff, the pair transformed Kerobokan penitentiary in Bali into a model of rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>On December 9 last year, Mr Joko said: "The clemency requests are not on my table yet. But I guarantee that there will be no clemency for convicts who committed narcotics-related crimes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mr Spontana, said "we have to respect the ongoing legal process", a reversal of the position the Attorney-General elucidated on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi stressed on Friday that Indonesia was determined to "maintain a good relationship with Australia, with all countries".</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>She said a United Nations account of a human rights dialogue quoting Indonesian diplomats saying the country could introduce a moratorium on the death penalty was a misrepresentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"We protested because we never stated it and the uploaded version from the Office of the UN Human Rights High Commissioner has been revised in accordance to what was stated by the Indonesian delegation," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>At the time of writing, the UN had not changed the document.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Bali police spokesman Hery Wiyanto has revealed that an investigation will be launched into the media leak of a photo of a smiling Denpasar police chief with his arm on Chan's shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Mr Hery said Senior Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo did not violate any rules and would not be investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"It wasn't a selfie moment, it wasn't a pose," Mr Hery said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"He was talking to and encouraging the boys."</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>However, he said intelligence officers and the internal affairs division of the police force were investigating who took the photo and how it reached the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Disciplinary action would be taken if the investigation discovered the photo had been sold to the media.</td></tr>
