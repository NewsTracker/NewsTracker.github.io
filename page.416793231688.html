<h3>Harper's 3 HRs, 5 RBIs lift Nationals over Marlins 7-5 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bryce Harper hit three home runs in a game for the first time and had five RBIs in his finest day with the Nationals, and Washington beat the Miami Marlins 7-5 Wednesday for their third straight series win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Harper hit a 393-foot solo shot off the second inning, a 442-foot, two-run drive in the third and 445-foot bases-empty shot in the fifth, the last two reaching the second deck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Each of the home runs came on the second pitch of the at-bat off Tom Koehler (2-3), and they raised Harper's season total to eight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With an opportunity to tie major league record of four homers in a game, Harper hit a run-scoring groundout to second base against Sam Dyson in the seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Harper, in his fourth major league season, previously hit two homers in a game on five occasions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Max Scherzer (2-3) struck out 10 and allowed five runs and 10 hits over seven-plus innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He entered with a 1.26 ERA but Washington scored a total of two runs in his three defeats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Scherzer was pulled after giving up a three-run homer to Giancarlo Stanton in the eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Drew Stroren got three outs for his eighth save and seal the Nationals' second win in the three-game series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Harper entered 1 for 17 in May and 2 for 15 against Koehler, although one of those hits was a home run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He became the fourth Nationals player to hit three homers in game following Alfonso Soriano (2006), Adam Dunn (2010), and Ryan Zimmerman (2013).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>With Harper leading the way, the Nationals hit two homers, three doubles and a single over the first three innings while building a 4-2 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The barrage began in the second, when Harper hit an opposite-field drive to left on a 1-0 pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the third, two doubles and a sacrifice fly by Yunel Escobar made it 2-all before another Harper home run put the Nationals ahead for good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Harper connected in the fifth inning with such force that Stanton stood motionless in right field, looking toward the infield as the ball soared into the seats behind him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Marlins: OF Christian Yelich (lower back strain) was scheduled to play for Class A Jupiter on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Marlins hoped to activate him off the DL during the four-game series in San Francisco that starts Thursday night.</td></tr>
