<h3>Baltimore seeks more federal aid in face of murder surge</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE, June 3 (Reuters) - Baltimore police are seeking more federal help in the face of a sharp upturn in murders fueled by drug turf wars, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The deadly surge has come as police tactics have come under criticism following the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died in April from injuries in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Batts said that 27 pharmacies and two methadone clinics had been broken into since rioting, arson and looting erupted on April 27 hours after Gray's funeral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"There's enough narcotics on the streets of Baltimore to keep it intoxicated for a year," he said at a news conference flanked by federal and state police officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"That amount of drugs has thrown off the balance" between gangs in the city, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Baltimore posted 43 murders in May, the highest monthly total since 1972.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Batts said he was requesting more federal agents and prosecutors to help fight the upturn in crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Batts said that in the last week officers had served 14 warrants assisted by federal agents and state police, and a task force of local, state and federal officers had arrested 83 people with open warrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Batts said one man had been arrested for the shooting deaths of a 27-year-old man and a 9-year-old boy over the May 23-25 Memorial Day weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Six officers have been charged in the Gray case, and the U.S. Justice Department is investigating the Baltimore police over the use of force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Batts said the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional group, would investigate the Gray case as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Baltimore police were "in a stage of frustration and anger" over the charges and the unrest, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But, he added, "We have an ethical responsibility to keep this city safe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Lieutenant Gene Ryan, the president of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>3, said the union was seeking internal records to find out what police commanders did when the rioting broke out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Baltimore union wants to do its own after-action report on the unrest since police had failed to do one, he told reporters in a separate news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>More than 160 police officers and scores of firefighters were injured in the unrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake met on Wednesday with U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez to discuss summer youth jobs, the second Cabinet member she has met with this week.</td></tr>
