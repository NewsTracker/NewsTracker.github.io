<h3>Google Fiber's Next City Is Its Biggest Yet: San Antonio, Texas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google Fiber is coming to San Antonio, a move that will make the company&#x2019;s speedy 1Gbps internet available to the city&#x2019;s 1.4 million residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>So far this is the largest market that Google is launching Fiber in, though not the first in Texas &#x2014; service in Austin&#xA0;started up last December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>San Antonio&#x2019;s people are in for a tough wait; Google is only now nearing the design phase of a daunting project that calls for over 4,000 miles of fiber-optic cable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With San Antonio&#x2019;s addition, here&#x2019;s what the current Fiber map looks like &#x2014; now and for the near future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In March, San Antonio city officials worked to&#xA0;clear the way for Google to enter town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>So San Antonio has graduated from &#x201C;potential Fiber city&#x201D; into the real thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But as Google freely admits, it&#x2019;s going to be some time before residents can get the company&#x2019;s TV and internet offerings and ditch whoever they&#x2019;re paying now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>AT&T is also planning to bring its own gigabit internet service, &#x201C;U-Verse with AT&T GigaPower,&#x201D; to San Antonio, so Google won&#x2019;t be without competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>AT&T and Comcast have been expanding their own ultra-fast connections &#x2014; in some cases faster than Fiber &#x2014; to push back against Fiber&#x2019;s buildout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>By and large though, most of us are still limited to the fastest tier offered by cable internet providers.</td></tr>
