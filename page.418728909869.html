<h3>Greece's parliament passes second crucial bailout bill</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's parliament has passed a second batch of reforms to help unlock a huge new bailout for the country's stricken economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Embattled Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras had suffered a major rebellion by MPs in his radical-left party Syriza last week during a first vote on the reforms demanded by Athens' international creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Tsipras had to rely on opposition MPs to pass the law, which approved sweeping changes to debt-crippled Greece's taxes, pensions and labour rules, a key condition for opening talks on a bailout worth up to 86 billion euros ($126 billion) over three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The second bill covered civil justice reforms, a bank deposit protection scheme, and measures to shore up the liquidity of the banks, which reopened Monday after a three-week closure imposed to avert a collapse of Greece's financial system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Analysts had said the debate would show whether the premier could avoid another deep split within his own party, and head off the risk of early elections, after only six months in power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The government received a boost on Tuesday when Standard & Poor's raised its credit rating on Greece by two notches to CCC+ from CCC-, still in junk territory but a step in the right direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The priority right now is to normalise the [financial] system, but at the same time to protect low-income citizens," state news agency ANA quoted Mr Tsipras as saying after a meeting with bank chiefs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The banks have seen some 40 billion euros withdrawn since December by customers anxious over the safety of their cash - seriously undermining the banks' ability to function normally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bloomberg News reported that the European Central Bank boosted its cash lifeline for Greek banks - the program known as Emergency Liquidity Assistance - by 900 million euros ($1.3 billion) on Wednesday (local time), in a move that had been announced last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The ELA is the only source of funding for banks until the bailout package can take effect - and, by extension, the sole financial lifeline preventing the Greek economy from imploding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said he hoped to see the banks recapitalised by the end of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Civil servants' union ADEDY and the communist-affiliated PAME union staged protests during the emergency debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When the more controversial reforms were passed last week, angry anti-austerity protesters clashed with police outside parliament, hurling petrol bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Tsipras was forced to reshuffle his cabinet last week, having sacked three ministers for voting against the first bailout bill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Government spokeswoman Olga Gerovassili said Monday that elections would not be "useful at the moment", and the government had "no intention" of calling early polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ms Gerovassili said negotiations with Greece's creditors - the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund - would resume immediately after Wednesday's vote.</td></tr>
