<h3>MH17 investigators find ‘possible’ BUK missile parts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Investigators probing the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 said on Tuesday they had identified pieces that "possibly" come from a Russian-made BUK missile from eastern Ukraine, where the plane crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>THE HAGUE: Investigators probing the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 said on Tuesday they had identified pieces that "possibly" come from a Russian-made BUK missile from eastern Ukraine, where the plane crashed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>International and Dutch investigators are probing "several parts, possibly originating from a BUK surface-to-air missile system," said a joint statement from prosecutors and the Dutch safety board (OVV).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"These parts have been secured during a previous recovery-mission in eastern Ukraine and are in possession of the criminal investigation team MH17 and the Dutch safety board," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Flight MH17 was shot down on July 17 last year, killing all 298 people on board during heavy fighting between Kiev's armed forces and pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ukraine and many in the west have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they may have used a BUK missile supplied by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russia and the rebels deny any responsibility and point the finger at Ukraine's military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Members of the joint investigation team (JIT) comprising representatives from the Netherlands, Ukraine, Malaysia, Australia, Britain, the United States and Russia are currently meeting in The Hague to discuss a draft OVV report into what caused the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The statement from the OVV and JIT said that the pieces being investigated "can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts. The JIT will internationally enlist the help of experts, among others forensic specialists and weapon-experts," it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Investigators stressed that "at present the conclusion cannot be drawn that there is a causal connection between the discovered parts and the crash of flight MH17."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Russia last month vetoed a bid at the United Nations security council to set up an international tribunal to try those behind the shooting down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Countries involved in that bid are now looking at other means to carry out a prosecution, although no suspects have yet been publicly identified or detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The OVV is to release its final report into what, but not who, downed the aircraft in October.</td></tr>
