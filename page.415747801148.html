<h3>Jurors to recommend penalty in girl's running death</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) - An Alabama woman will spend her birthday in court learning whether jurors want her to be executed for running her granddaughter to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Joyce Hardin Garrard is due back in court Thursday for the sentencing portion of her capital murder trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The session will come on her 50th birthday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A judge told jurors to be ready for closing arguments, legal instructions and deliberations on Garrard's fate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jurors will recommend either death or life without parole for Garrard's conviction in the death of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A vote of at least 10 of 12 jurors is required for the panel to recommend death, but a simple majority can recommend life.</td></tr>
