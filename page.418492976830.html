<h3>Apple Pay about to launch in the UK</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple Pay is about to go live in the UK, with shops' signs being updated for the launch and HSBC's official account apparently confirming the date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company is gearing up to launch the new service on July 14, the leaks indicate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That fits with previous rumours, based on information shared by shops that were gearing up for the launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>HSBC's official Twitter feed posted, and then deleted, a message confirming that Apple Pay was about to launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Elsewhere, shops have been adding stickers to confirm that they accept Apple Pay alongside other payment technologies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's unclear whether Apple will have to send out an update for users to download to allow the technology to work, or whether it will just be switched on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple Pay works by letting people load their card details into their phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They can then touch their iPhone 6 or later, or Apple Watch, to the contactless payment machine and pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple Pay will be supported by all the major banks, apart from Barclays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It will also be supported by all shops that have contactless payment systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Initially, purchases will be limited to 20, but that is expected to rise in the autumn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The maximum charge for contactless payment cards is also 20, but is going up to 30 in September - it's likely that the Apple Pay limit will be upgraded at the same time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple Pay works online as well as in shops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The company claims that its online payment system is more safe than normal purchases, because it keeps the shops from seeing their details.</td></tr>
