<h3>Microsoft: Gears of War on Xbox One will be at E3</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>XBOX at E3 will be the setting for the next big Gears of Wars update as Microsoft look to impress with one of their strongest line-ups at the annual video game conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A post from the team working on the next GoW title revealed that their next project is set to be revealed later in June at the LA event, while they themselves have undergone a few changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Black Tusk Studios are developing the next Gears of War game for Xbox One, and have now been renamed "The Coalition," studio chief Rod Fergusson revealed today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A post on Microsoft's Xbox Wire website explained the reasoning behind the change was to try and boost brand recoginition among gamers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Beginning today, the Vancouver-based Xbox team working on the Gears of War franchise will be known as The Coalition," Fergusson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"What's in a name? In short, The Coalition speaks to who we are as a team, and what it is we're working on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"A coalition is a team of diverse individuals working together for a common purpose, a concept that we feel describes our studio quite well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Fans will also recognise the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) from Gears of War lore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"When people hear 343 Industries, they associate it with Halo; when they hear Turn 10 Studios, they know that's who makes Forza. Moving forward, when you hear The Coalition, we want you to think of Gears of War."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fergusson then added that E3 would host news on the next Gears of War project heading to the Xbox One, although multiple are thought to be in the pipeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Speaking of Gears of War, we're getting close to E3, where we will share more on what's next for Gears of War," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Specifically, Gears fans should be sure to tune in to Xbox Daily: LIVE @ E3, on Monday June 15 at 4PM Pacific to see what we're working on."</td></tr>
