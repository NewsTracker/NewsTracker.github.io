<h3>Twitter founder feeling 'Super' as he heads in new direction</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Biz Stone knows abandoning a struggling project to try something else can be a smart move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After all, he was part of a team that dumped the seldom-heard podcasting service Odeo nearly a decade ago to work on a new idea called Twitter that transformed how people communicate and made him a multimillionaire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Stone is hoping his latest change in direction pays off as he heads down a new path at Jelly Industries, a San Francisco startup he launched shortly after leaving Twitter three years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jelly made headlines 16 months ago with the release of mobile app that taps into social networks to find experts who can answer questions that stump Internet search engines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Within a few months, Stone and Jelly co-founder Ben Finkel realized the question-and-answer format wasn't catching on so they came up with a different app called Super for sharing opinions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Super's name reflects how Stone feels about the app about five months after it was released.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We know in our guts that this has legs, just as we knew in our guts that it was time to stop working on Jelly," Stone says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Super is trying to broaden its appeal with an app update available Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The new features will enable users to select and post the faces of other people who have set up profiles on the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>After "facetagging" people, their images mingle with the selection of emojis and large, colorful text that Super provides for its users to create emphatic messages declaring their passions and peeves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The goal is to infuse Super with a fun-loving vibe that was notably missing from the more scholarly Jelly app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Super is more about expressing yourself with an emotional bent," Stone says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Unfortunately, Jelly was too much like doing homework. People literally did their homework on it. It just wasn't the business we wanted to be in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Stone, 41, knows many people think Super is stupid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The derision only reinforces his conviction that he is on the right track because he remembers people mocking Twitter in its early days too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Something has to be fun to use before it can become important," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Look at Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook. They all started out to be fun at first, now they are important. If you want to build a platform capable of toppling despotic regimes, it also has to support fart jokes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Although he no longer works at Twitter, Stone remains an adviser and major shareholder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He meets weekly two other co-founders, Twitter Chairman Jack Dorsey and former CEO Evan Williams, and recently had drinks with Twitter's current CEO Dick Costolo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He says he is holding on to all of his Twitter stock, which has fallen by 27 percent since the April 27 release of the company's first-quarter results that renewed concerns about user and revenue growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I love, love what they are doing," Stone says.</td></tr>
