<h3>Yahoo gives Alibaba spinoff a name: Aabaco</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Yahoo is moving forward with the spinoff of its sizable stake in China's Alibaba Group, and announced a name for it: Aabaco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Yahoo stockholders will get shares in the new entity, Aabaco Holdings Inc., which will hold nearly 384 million shares in Alibaba, according to documents filed Friday with regulators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That stake is currently worth about $32 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Investors are enthusiastic about the plan, which Yahoo has touted as a tax-free transaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Federal authorities are reviewing their policy on such deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>CEO Marissa Mayer has said she doesn't believe any policy change would affect the spinoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The filing says Yahoo won't proceed without assurances the deal is tax-free for investors, but Aabaco could be liable if authorities ultimately determine that taxes are owed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo expects the spinoff to close in the fourth quarter.</td></tr>
