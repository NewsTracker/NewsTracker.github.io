<h3>DNA confirms that girl in Mexico is US woman's daughter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MORELIA, Mexico (AP) - A Mexican prosecutor says DNA tests on Alondra Diaz match the U.S. mother who has been searching for her for eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jose Martin Godoy Castro says tests show that Alondra is the daughter of Houston woman Dorotea Garcia, who has searched for the girl since Alondra's father took her to Mexico without her consent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Godoy spoke late Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Garcia's search gained international attention last month after Judge Cinthia Elodia Mercado ruled that another teenager, 14-year-old Alondra Luna, was the missing girl and ordered her released to Garcia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Video recordings circulated widely of Alondra Luna screaming and desperately resisting police after the court decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Garcia reunited with her real daughter late Tuesday in a courtroom in the western state of Michoacan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But this time the judge waited for DNA confirmation.</td></tr>
