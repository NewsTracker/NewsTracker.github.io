<h3>Egypt arrests top Muslim Brotherhood leaders</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Egyptian authorities arrested two top leaders of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood after two years on the run, as ousted President Mohammed Morsi awaited a court confirmation Tuesday on his death sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The arrests are part of a massive government crackdown on the 87-year-old Brotherhood launched after the military ouster of Morsi in July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Morsi, who hails from the Brotherhood, was overthrown after millions staged demonstrations demanding he step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The two detained leaders are Abdel-Rahman el-Bar, the group's top religious cleric, and Mahmoud Ghozlan, the Brotherhood's former spokesman and a member of its top decision-making body, an official said, adding that they were hiding in a Giza suburb when they were arrested Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A Brotherhood spokesman Mohammed Montassir described the arrests on his Facebook page as a "failed attempt by the brutal coup authorities to disrupt the revolutionaries across the nation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He added that the Egyptian government would fail to "terrorize" the Brotherhood and vowed, "We are on our path steadfast until achieving freedom and dignity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Once the country's most influential political group, dozens of Brotherhood leaders have been put on trial, with many receiving death sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Tuesday, an Egyptian court is expected to look into Morsi's death sentence, over a mass prison break during Egypt's 2011 uprising that eventually brought him to power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On May 16, a court sentenced Morsi to death and referred the case to Egypt's top Muslim cleric for a consultative opinion - a normal step for all death sentences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The session Tuesday will consider the response from Grand Mufti Shawki Allam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The crackdown on the Brotherhood had ignited divisions within the group's highly disciplined ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A younger generation is pushing for more violent and confrontational tactics, analysts say, while the older generation - at least in their official announcements - is insisting on "peaceful means" of resistance.</td></tr>
