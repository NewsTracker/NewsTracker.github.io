<h3>NBA could alter schedule, but no change to playoffs, lottery (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The playoffs will open Saturday without the Oklahoma City Thunder, who finished ninth in the Western Conference with a 45-37 record that would have made them the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>6 seed in the weaker East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Two teams in the East field finished below .500, renewing calls to make the playoffs for the best 16 teams, instead of the current top eight in each conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Silver said owners reviewed data over about 30 years, while also considering the need for traditional rivalries born out of having divisions and conferences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''When we presented all the data to the teams, what becomes clear is that there is no obvious solution,'' Silver said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It's not to say that we don't think there should be a change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Another change could come quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said there were discussions about extending the 2015-16 season by a week, which he said could reduce the number of back-to-backs to an all-time low average of 16 per team, with an average of just one four-in-five-nights stretch per team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The playoffs and draft lottery apparently will stay the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Silver noted the races for the final spots in both the West and East, claimed by New Orleans and Brooklyn, went down to the final night of the regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''If you seeded 1 through 16, of course you wouldn't have that,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said there was also discussion of a play-in tournament in which an undetermined number of teams would play for the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>8 spots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I have to say I am intrigued by that idea,'' Silver said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>So is lottery reform, which fell short of approval in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The current system gives the team with the worst record the best odds to win the lottery and the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>1 pick in the draft, which could encourage tanking, or losing on purpose in hopes of getting a better pick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Silver said owners felt they shouldn't touch that until after the new media deals begin in 2016, which will create a huge jump in revenues and make the salary cap soar by more than $20 million to possibly $90 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They want to see how that affects free agency and trades before touching the draft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>''Once again on the draft lottery we agreed to continue looking at it but it seems highly unlikely at this point that we're going to make a change for next season,'' he said.</td></tr>
