<h3>Charlotte Hornets vs. Utah Jazz observations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jefferson started against his former team, the Utah Jazz, and was not under a minutes restriction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Hornets played without starting power forward Cody Zeller, still out with a sprained right shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Coach Steve Clifford said he doubts Zeller will play Tuesday at the Los Angeles Clippers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As of Monday, Zeller still couldn't raise his arm high enough to shoot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Hornets this season are basically Jazz East; three current starters - Jefferson, Mo Williams and Marvin Williams - all played for Utah together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The big open question for the Hornets is when Clifford moves point guard Kemba Walker back into the starting lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It's a reasonable guess that will happen sometime during this five-game road trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Hornets flew to Utah early Sunday in order to practice in altitude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clifford always tries to do that before games in Denver and Salt Lake City.</td></tr>
