<h3>Mexico Prison Boss Sacked After El Chapo Escape</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The country's interior minister says the escape "must" have been an inside job, as a 60 million peso reward is offered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A maximum security prison boss has been sacked after Mexico's interior minister said the escape of one of the country's most feared drug lords must have been an inside job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Miguel Angel Osorio Chong announced the dismissal of three prison officials as Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman's family made public pictures appearing to show the Sinaloa cartel chief enjoying his freedom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Osorio Chong denied that Mexican authorities were ever informed by the United States of a potential escape plot after drug agents received information as far back as March 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) documents revealed that Guzman's family and associates were exploring the possibility of a jailbreak and a US official told AP that Mexican authorities had been alerted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Guzman, whose nickname means "Shorty", escaped from a maximum security jail for a second time through a 1.5km (1 mile) tunnel connected to an elaborate hatch in the shower area of his cell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The tunnel had its own ventilation and light system, along with a motorcycle on a rail system that is thought to have been used to transport tools and remove earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Despite the huge bounty, Guzman appeared ready to taunt the authorities, with a blog that monitors Mexico's drug war publishing photos purportedly showing him flying in a plane and enjoying a beer since his escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The photos, sent by one of the kingpin's sons, were allegedly taken two days after he fled the jail but have not been verified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the images, Guzman seems to be sporting a full head of hair and a moustache, while in a recent prison photo released by authorities, he has a shaved head and no facial hair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police probing the escape have questioned 49 people, including 32 prison employees.</td></tr>
