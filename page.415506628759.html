<h3>Joel Plaskett shows off his roots on new album</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>And it certainly wouldn't be out of place for some of the Celtic-inspired tracks, namely the fiddle-filled On A Dime, to be blasting in the background of your favourite Irish pub.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That coincidental timing aside, the title was actually inspired by a street in Dartmouth, NS, where a former neighbour explained that a bent guardrail in a dangerous, winding part of the road was the ultimate "Park Avenue Sobriety Test" for boozy drivers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Plaskett, thinking the name sounded similar to the Kinks' classic 1968 album The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, knew he had the album title and theme -- the only thing he didn't have were the songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The places where I'm tapping into on this one, I've done versions of it before on different records," Plaskett says from a downtown Toronto bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Why I think the acronym for this one (P.A.S.T.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For the uninitiated, the still-boyish-looking Plaskett, who is set to turn 40 next month, is a veteran around the Canadian music scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He fronted the influential 90s alt-rockers Thrush Hermit (who had a hand in creating P.A.S.T. along with his longtime touring band the Emergency).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Two decades later, he continues to pad his excellent body of work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And to say Plaskett is proud of his roots would be an understatement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He even has a line in one of his new tracks, Alright OK, that states "Halifax is the land of the free, I don't care what the anthem says."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>How does he explain that one to his fans in Vancouver?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I write as if I'm in the first person and I do draw from my own experiences when I form these songs, Plaskett explains. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>I have On A Dime which is a reminiscence about the good old days while Alright OK is about being untethered... a guy in a bar shooting his mouth off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I love the east coast and I'm happy to sing that line like I mean it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Plaskett carefully explains that he doesn't consciously set out to have any type of sound, it's just that Nova Scotia naturally influences his songs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I'm most influenced by my contemporary musicians on the east coast," says Plaskett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"That's not to say other Canadian music doesn't have an effect on me, it does. But I'm right there in the heart of it and I feel as though I have a connection there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's not like I'm trying to channel that, it just is who I am. I recognize that when I'm travelling, I write about where I'm from, and when I come home, I write about where I've been."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>When asked about turning the big 4-0, Plaskett puts on his philosophy hat to explain the important day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"I'm comfortable with getting older and gaining experience," Plaskett says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I may have a crisis in three or four years, but I don't fear it like some people do. If I'm going to leave my seven-year-old boy with any knowledge, I have to get older in order to do that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Plaskett is overjoyed when the conversation turns toward his old band Thrush Hermit, and he even tells a story about a time when the group passed up the chance to be on a huge film's soundtrack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"We turned down some stuff that we thought would be lame, so we didn't seize the opportunity," Plaskett laments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"One of those opportunities was to be on the Dumb and Dumber soundtrack and we never pursued it, for whatever reason. We were on the Mallrats soundtrack, however."</td></tr>
