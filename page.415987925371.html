<h3>Lufthansa CEO Spohr treading cautiously after Germanwings crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The heads of Lufthansa and its low-cost airline Germanwings are visiting the site of the crash that killed 150 people amid mounting questions about the co-pilot and how much his employers knew about his mental health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>FILE - In this Wednesday, March 25, 2015, file photo, Lufthansa Group CEO Carsten Spohr looks down during a news conference at the Barcelona airport, in Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 in France has heaped intense pressure on Spohr, who in barely a year at the helm has had to grapple with big financial losses, labor unrest and tough competition from lower-cost carriers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FRANKFURT, Germany - The crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 in France has placed intense pressure on Lufthansa's CEO Carsten Spohr, who in less than a year at the helm has had to grapple with weak earnings, labor unrest and tough competition from lower-cost carriers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Analysts say he has made the correct moves, notably in his expressions of sympathy for the 149 victims and the relatives of those who died March 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Officials say co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately flew the Airbus A320 into a mountainside in the French Alps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They point to Lufthansa's admission that Lubitz had told them during his training that he had been treated for serious depression as an example of owning up quickly to bad news.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"They are taking it absolutely seriously, they are not being anything other than completely cooperative with the authorities, and that's a good start," said Andrew Charlton, managing director of government affairs firm Aviation Advocacy in Nyon, Switzerland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Spohr, 48, is far from done with the grim ordeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The investigation will take months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Still ahead is the April 17 memorial service in the massive cathedral in Cologne, near where Germanwings is headquartered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The crash has stained Lufthansa's strong safety reputation - it is its worst crash since being revived after World War II in 1955.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The disaster during the flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf has subjected the airline to scrutiny over whether Lubitz should have been allowed to join its budget subsidiary Germanwings in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Spohr has said "no system in the world can rule out such an isolated event" but has been careful to say the word "sorry" and express his personal pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>So far, the German press, unions and government have not turned sharply on Spohr.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Germany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said discussions over any management culpability from knowing Lubitz's history of depression are "unnecessary."</td></tr>
