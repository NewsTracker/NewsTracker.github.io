<h3>U.S. stock futures fall as Apple results disappoint</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. stock index futures fell on Wednesday as corporate earnings disappointed, especially from Apple (AAPL.O), the world's largest company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>* Apple shares slumped 6.2 percent to $122.61 in premarket trading, a day after the iPhone maker's revenue forecast for the fourth quarter fell below expectations.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>* U.S. stocks had closed lower on Tuesday as results from IBM (IBM.N) and United Technologies (UTX.N) dampened early optimism over earnings season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>* While markets are near record highs, June-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to dip 1.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, well below the 5.9 percent gain forecast on Jan. 1.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>The data is expected at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>* GoPro (GPRO.O) rose 2.9 percent to $63.90 after the action camera maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast current-quarter revenue above market estimates, helped by strong sales in Asia.</td></tr>
