<h3>Lionel Messi floors James Milner with a nutmeg, leaving Pep Guardiola with his head in his hands</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Spaniard, now in charge of Bayern Munich who qualified for the quarter-finals last week, will have been mightily impressed with his former club, who dominated the match and eventually won 1-0 on the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Guardiola almost missed Barcelona take the lead after arriving late.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Just as he was taking his seat, Vincent Kompany gave the ball away on the edge of the box and Neymar was through - but although he beat Joe Hart, the Brazilian forward found the post and the ball rolled agonisingly across goal before going out for a goal-kick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Barcelona were well in charge throughout and it was only thanks to Hart that Manchester City escaped with their pride intact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During the match James Milner was the subject of Guardiola's amusement when the England midfielder was nutmegged by Lionel Messi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Argentinian, who was absolutely brilliant in the first half, nipped the ball through Milner's legs, leaving him on the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Former Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola Pep laughed and even put his hands to his face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Oh dear, James.</td></tr>
