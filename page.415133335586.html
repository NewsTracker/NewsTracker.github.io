<h3>Jihadi John linked to network of failed London bombers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Islamist militant Mohammed Emwazi, identified as Jihadi John, was a member of a network in contact with one of the men convicted of trying to bomb the London Underground in 2005, the UK government says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Emwazi has fronted Islamic State videos from Syria that showed either the killing or bodies of victims including British, US and Japanese citizens and Syrian soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Media reports last week named the man, who appeared clad in black and brandishing a knife, as Mohammed Emwazi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The British government's view is set out in court papers, publicly available on the Internet, which refer to 2011 and 2013 legal hearings concerning two of Emwazi's London associates, known only as Iranian-born CE and Ethiopian-born J1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The court papers offer a glimpse of Emwazi's life in London before he left for Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They show that Emwazi was known to Britain's security services as early as 2011 and that they believed he was part of a group involved in procuring funds and equipment "for terrorism-related purposes" in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They show that authorities thought Emwazi was part of a network that numbered at least 12 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>One of the same network's members, J1, spoke on the phone with Hussain Osman, one of the men convicted in connection with an unsuccessful attempt to blow up the Underground on the day of the failed attack in 2005, the papers show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>British Islamists killed 52 people in an attack on London's transport network on July 7, 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Another group of Islamists - of which Osman was one - tried and failed to pull off a second attack two weeks later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Osman, who like J1 was also born in Ethiopia, was convicted by a London court of conspiracy to murder in 2007 and sentenced to a minimum of 40 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The same documents show that J1, Emwazi's associate, was stopped by police in Scotland in 2004 with three others wearing plastic gloves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The men said they were on their way to an area where the authorities said an extremist training camp was being held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The camp's organiser, a man identified in court papers only as Hamid, was subsequently convicted of soliciting to murder and of providing terrorism training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Four of the men involved in the failed London bombings had attended a similar camp organised by Hamid earlier that same year, the court papers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 2011 court papers pertained to a case between the British government and CE over the authorities' decision to relocate him outside London as a preventative measure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The 2013 papers referred to an immigration appeal case between the British government and J1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The legal documents came to public attention as a political row over the way Britain handles militants broke out, with the opposition Labour Party accusing prime minister David Cameron's government of "tying the hands" of security services with insufficiently robust legislation.</td></tr>

<h3>First Ebola-infected U.S. nurse plans to sue, says hospital didn't train her properly</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>She says her hospital used her for publicity purposes and did not train her properly in treating an Ebola patient, from whom she contracted the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The first person infected with Ebola in the United States, nurse Nina Pham, said she was used for publicity purposes by her hospital, which also invaded her privacy and did not properly train her, the Dallas Morning News reported on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Pham, 26, told the newspaper that chaos hit the Dallas hospital when it admitted Thomas Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States after he contracted it in Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nurses were ill prepared and received little guidance on how to treat Ebola or protect themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I wanted to believe that they would have my back and take care of me, but they just haven't risen to the occasion," Pham told The Dallas Morning News in an exclusive interview published in its Sunday edition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Duncan was put into isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in late September and died less than two weeks later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pham, who became infected while treating him, later recovered and was welcomed in the Oval Office by President Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She is planning to sue the hospital, the paper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The hospital has reached a settlement with Duncan's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The hospital did not address details of Pham's allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It said in statement: "Nina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time. We continue to support and wish the best for her, and we remain optimistic that constructive dialogue can resolve this matter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Pham said nurses initially did not wear hazmat suits when treating Duncan and went in with double gloves taped to double gowns, double booties and face shields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Pham said her neck area was exposed, the newspaper said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hazmat suits came a few days later but meanwhile, medical waste piled up in a hospital room because maintenance staff would not collect it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We were mopping floors with bleach and doing janitorial work and dealing with hazardous, lethal waste," Pham told the paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Another nurse who treated Duncan, Amber Vinson, also became infected with Ebola and recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Pham said the hospital did not respect her right to privacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In one instance, she was videotaped speaking to a doctor and the video was released to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Pham said it was done without her permission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Charla Aldous, Pham's attorney told the paper the hospital "used Nina as a PR pawn."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Pham said she is also experiencing symptoms such as body aches and high liver enzymes as a result of experimental medication she received.</td></tr>
