<h3>Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best players in history but Serbia can stop him, says Branislav Ivanovic ahead of Euro 2016 qualifier against Portugal ?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Portugal may have 'one of the best players in the history of football' in the form of Cristiano Ronaldo but Branislav Ivanovic is confident his Serbia side can nullify the threat of the Real Madrid star on Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Serbia currently occupy fourth place in the Group I standings ahead of their clash with Portugal who sit just one point behind pool leaders Denmark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'You're speaking about one of the best players in the history of football, he's not so easy,' Ivanovic told Perform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'To be on the top level you have to prove yourself every day, he's doing that game by game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ivanovic's side were deducted three points following their 3-0 win against Albania in October when an unmanned drone carrying a pro-Albania flag flew over the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade and resulted in a melee between the two sets of players and some Serbian fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A 3-1 loss to Denmark in November has heaped further pressure on Serbia and Ivanovic concedes that Sunday's game is a must-win game for his side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'It is a crucial game for us, this qualification especially, because we expect to have more points in the three games, so the game against Portugal is crucial and massive for us,' the Chelsea defender added.</td></tr>
