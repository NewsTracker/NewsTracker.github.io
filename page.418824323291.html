<h3>Sebastian Vettel wins thrilling F1 race in Hungary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Lewis Hamilton started the Hungarian Grand Prix with a 17-point lead over Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, but he was lucky to leave the Hungaroring as the top driver in the standings after a comedy of errors left him struggling to finish in the top 10 - but a shocking finish saw Hamilton finish in front of Rosberg, but miles behind race winner Sebastian Vettel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The two Ferrari drivers darted into the lead after getting a magnificent start off the line, while pole sitter Hamilton slipped back to fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>On the very first lap, Hamilton lost control and cut across a gravel trap, and blamed his teammate Rosberg for cutting across his line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Following the mistake, Hamilton battled back up to fourth place, and a safety car period brought out by Nico Hulkenberg bunched up the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During a chaotic restart, Hamilton made contact with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in the first corner, causing damage to Hamilton's front wing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hamilton was forced to pit to change his wing, and a few laps later was assessed a drive-through penalty for causing a collision, dropping him out of the points entirely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rosberg, meanwhile seemed content to finish in second place behind Vettel, and fended off a charging Ricciardo for a number of laps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ricciardo finally went to overtake Rosberg with less than 10 laps remaining, but locked up his tires and went wide in the first turn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rosberg drove underneath Ricciardo to retake the position, but as he cut across the track Rosberg's rear tire made contact with Ricciardo's front wing, causing the tire to be cut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Rosberg limped back to the pits and changed his tire, but the mishap ruined his race and he would go on to finish in eighth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hamilton, on the quicker option tires, drove through the back of the pack to finish in sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>With the misfortune of the Mercedes cars and Kimi Raikkonen's mechanical troubles, Vettel cruised to victory, while 21-year-old Daniil Kvyat finished in second for his first career podium, ahead of teammate Ricciardo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Formula 1 is often criticized for not being exciting, but the Hungarian Grand Prix was two hours of madness.</td></tr>
