<h3>Sierra Leone plans another shutdown to stop Ebola's spread</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The West Africa Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 10,000 people is declining but the disease has remained stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Liberia, the third country severely affected, currently has no Ebola cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the drive to zero cases in Sierra Leone, the government will again ask residents to stay in their homes for three days, Alfred Palo Conteh, head of the country's National Ebola Response Center, said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The shutdown is expected to take place March 27 through 29, according to Patrick Fatoma, another official with the Ebola response center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The government has done this before, and some experts said it was unexpectedly effective in providing information about to control the disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sierra Leone is "hoping it will be the last push to end Ebola outbreak. We want it to be community-owned and for people to do the proper things," said Fatoma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There are currently about 30 cases in treatment centers across the country, Fatoma said, a far cry from the height of the epidemic when hundreds of people were falling sick each week in Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But experts say eradicating the last cases in a country can be the most difficult work.</td></tr>

<h3>The 10 best and worst young adult film adaptations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>No sooner did the hugely successful books become hugely successful movies than every page of Young Adult fiction ever written became fair game for the big screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sometimes, as with The Hunger Games, the jump from page to screen works well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And sometimes, as anyone who recently sat through The Giver (based on Lois Lowry's book) can attest, it doesn't.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This week, Insurgent is in theatres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This is the much-anticipated second chapter in the 'Divergent' adventures of Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) as they attempt to use their gifts in an oppressive futuristic society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>To coincide with the opening of Insurgent, let's look at some of the best and worst in movies made from YA books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There's a whole bunch of mediocre out there -- Sisterhood of The Travelling Pants, those Percy Jackson movies, that Series Of Unfortunate Events, The Maze Runner, Ender's Game and so on -- that you won't find on either list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Half of you would put it on your best list, and half on your worst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>So we're ignoring it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Boys will be boys" and they should dig holes. Shia LaBeouf, Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver star in this wonderful adaptation of Louis Sachar's book about a special sort of juvenile jail. Your kids will love it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders was also made into a great film, but if you had to pick, Rumble Fish, directed by Frances Ford Coppola, is the better choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>This film helped make Matt Dillon a star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Gang fights with Mickey Rourke, Vincent Spano, Nicolas Cage and Chris Penn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>You have to wait 90 minutes for the big action scenes in this sequel, but thanks to Jennifer Lawrence, you'll do so happily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A darker, edgier film than the first one, and filled with conflict, all brought to life by a cast that includes Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Woody Harrelson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Miles Teller is the cool guy who drinks a bit too much; Shailene Woodley is the nerdy girl he finds himself attracted to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Far more sophisticated than the usual teen fare, with no easy answers or happy endings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A bedtime story comes alive, with the beauteous Robin Wright as the princess, swashbuckling Cary Elwes as her hero and Chris Sarandon as the snarky Prince Humperdinck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Wallace Shawn, Andre The Giant, Christopher Guest, Mandy Patinkin and Billy Crystal play all the wild and colourful characters you'd expect in a fairy tale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>All the Harry Potter movies are good, but this is the film in which Harry has to grow up -- it's believed Sirius Black is coming after him, and the film is steeped in dread and angst.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A much darker and more adult film than what came before, and it sets the tone for all that follows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Terrific special effects; couldn't hurt that Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity, Children of Men) is the director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Paris in the past, an orphan in a train station, a celebration of film and plenty of magic -- it's all here in Martin Scorsese's multiple Oscar-winning Hugo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Ben Kingsley, Jude Law, Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone, Chloe Moretz and Asa Butterfield star.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Fight amongst yourselves -- all three movies were both critical and popular success stories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As the longest of the three, this last film offered more of a good thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That's our argument, anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Through the wardrobe and into the magical world of Narnia -- who wouldn't want to travel to such an enchanted place?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Tilda Swinton was particularly riveting as the White Witch, don't you think?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Anne Hathaway is a terrific geek in this film version of Meg Cabot's novel about an ordinary teenager who discovers she's actually a princess in an obscure royal family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The nerdy-girl-to-royal-woman metamorphosis takes place under the guidance of Julie Andrews; this is a sunny, uptempo, sweet-natured movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Chloe Moretz is in a coma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>So is the audience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Adolescence re-imagined as life as an alien, with Alex Pettyfer as the human-like hunk who has to survive on earth even though his number is up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Or something.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Guy finds dragon, has to defeat evil emperor in cinematic snorefest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Subterranean futuristic city needs saving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>You won't care.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Hey, guess what!</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>You're a demon slayer!</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Note to teen lovers: you're so plucky!</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>You'll die anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Witch or not, you'll pay for those broken windows, Missy!</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Southern fried gothic nonsense about teen love and age-old family curses.</td></tr>
