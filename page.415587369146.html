<h3>Islamic State Claims Responsibility for Tunisia Attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign tourists scrambled in panic Wednesday after militants stormed a museum in Tunisia's capital and killed scores of people, "shooting at anything that moved," a witness said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Islamic State group claimed responsibility Thursday for the attack that killed 21 people at a museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Tunisian authorities said the two slain gunmen had no clear links to extremists, and analysts said existing militant cells are merely being inspired by the group, rather than establishing its presence across North Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police announced the arrest of five people described as directly tied to the two gunmen who opened fire Wednesday at the National Bardo Museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Four others said to be supporters of the cell also were arrested in central Tunisia, not far from where a group claiming allegiance to al-Qaida's North African branch has been active.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tunisians stepped around trails of blood and broken glass outside the museum to rally in solidarity with the 21 victims - most of them foreign tourists from cruise ships - and with the country's fledgling democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Marchers carried signs saying, "No to terrorism," and "Tunisia is bloodied but still standing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In claiming responsibility for the attack, the Islamic State group issued a statement and audio on jihadi websites applauding the dead gunmen as "knights" for their "blessed invasion of one of the dens of infidels and vice in Muslim Tunisia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Several well-armed groups in neighboring and chaotic Libya have already pledged their allegiance to Islamic State based in Iraq and Syria, but the attack of such magnitude in Tunisia - the only country to emerge from the Arab Spring uprisings with a functioning democracy - raised concern about the spread of extremism to the rest of North Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Analysts cautioned against seeing every such attack as evidence of a well-organized, centrally controlled entity spanning the Middle East, saying instead that small groups could merely be taking inspiration from the high-profile militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I think (the Islamic State) is probably taking credit for something it may not have played a role in," said Geoff Porter, a security analyst for North Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even as it is under pressure from rival militias in Libya and U.S.-backed forces in Iraq, the extremist group appears to be trying to raise its profile by associating itself with attacks around the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Confronted with a poor economy, young Tunisians have disproportionately gone abroad to fight with extremist groups in Libya, Syria and Iraq, including some affiliated with the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Upon their return home, some may have decided to carry out attacks on their own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tunisian authorities have estimated that of the 3,000 young people who left the country to fight with radical groups, about 500 have returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It could have been people who fought with the Islamic State or were inspired by it," said Raffaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Some guys may have come back, not liked what the government is doing, and attacked the tourist industry to hurt the economy - a classic move."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Until now, Tunisia's most deadly group was the Oqba Ibn Nafaa brigade, which is allied to al-Qaida and based in the mountains near the Algerian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Previously, it has confined its attacks to political figures and security services.</td></tr>

<h3>Kerry condemns reports of Syrian chemical weapons use</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a written statement, Kerry said the United States is "deeply disturbed" by the as-yet-unverified reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He called for a quick investigation into the allegations, though the State Department declined to spell out any specific consequences should they be proven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"If true, this would be only the latest tragic example of the Assad regime's atrocities against the Syrian people, which the entire international community must condemn," Kerry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The attack, alleged to have taken place on Monday, was first reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Citing "civilian resources," the group claimed six civilians, including three children, had been killed in the attack and that dozens of others were injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>CNN cannot independently confirm the accuracy of this report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last September, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded, with "a high degree of confidence," that chlorine was used "systematically and repeatedly" in attacks in northern Syria, though the group did not specifically point fingers at the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Syrian government agreed to turn over its declared chemical weapons stockpiles to the international community for destruction in 2013 as part of an agreement brokered by the U.S. and Russia and signed by the United Nations Security Council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The OPCW -- tasked with overseeing the process -- confirmed in June of last year that the final stockpile had been removed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>UNICEF vehicles travel a dusty road lined with remnants of buildings in the Old City of Homs, Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>UNICEF has 380 staff working on the Syrian crisis, 180 inside Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Seven-year-old Khalil stands barefoot on broom bristles in the snow at the entrance of his family's tent in Dikmen Valley, Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Khalil, a refugee from Aleppo, Syria, does not attend school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I don't want to go to school. I will work," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A Red Crescent volunteer speaks with Syrian refugees in Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies help 3.7 million Syrians each month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>About 3,000 IFRC volunteers are working with the Syrian crisis and 47 IFRC volunteers have died in the line of duty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Omer, 7, lives in Jordan's Zaatari Camp for Syrian refugees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Omer says, "Winter is not nice here. We step in mud and water. Snow is the worst part of winter here."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mercy Corps delivered 17,200 tons of food and supplies into northern Syria in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Winter makes daily life harder in Turkey's refugee settlements, especially for children who lack winter clothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>UNICEF says more than half of all Syrian refugees are children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This young woman whispered to the photographer, "Send warm clothes, please."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A CARE aid worker distributes food to a Syrian refugee family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>CARE has 230 staff in the Syrian region and has been working on the humanitarian crisis since the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Exhausted and traumatized Christians from villages in northeastern Syria gather at an Orthodox Christian church in Hasakah, Syria, seeking refuge after their small communities were terrorized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>IOCC and its church partner, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East, is providing food, medical attention and emergency aid to more than 1,000 displaced families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Khalil looks out from the doorway of his family's tent shelter, in a host community in Dikmen Valley, Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>UNICEF has reached more than 33 million Syrians inside and outside Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Hala, 4 months, is held by her big sister Mais, 5, in the Zaatari Camp in Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Her young parents and three siblings arrived in the camp two years ago from Dara'a, Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mercy Corps is helping about 3.7 million people affected by the Syrian crisis, including 2.7 million inside Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A CARE aid worker provides relief supplies for winter to a Syrian refugee in Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Many refugees struggle to find winter clothes, boots and blankets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The Security Council resolution did not prohibit Syria from developing or storing chlorine because that chemical has non-violent, commercial uses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>However, the use of chlorine gas as a weapon is prohibited by the 1925 Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria signed onto as part of the 2013 agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>This month, the Security Council passed a resolution condemning the use of chlorine gas in Syria and promising to take action if it were to be used again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"The international community cannot turn a blind eye to such barbarism," Kerry said in his statement Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>At the State Department's daily press briefing on Thursday, however, spokeswoman Jen Psaki gave no indication of how the U.S. might respond to the latest allegations of chemical weapons use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"Because unfortunately we've had discussions about these issues in the past, the OPCW would be the governing body that would oversee and look into allegations, and then it would be a discussion with the international community," Psaki said, adding that the U.S. would consult with its partners but that "I don't have any predictions for what it will mean and what the consequences would be if the allegations are confirmed."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In his statement, Kerry underscored the need for a prompt investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"The Assad regime's horrifying pattern of using chlorine as a chemical weapon against the Syrian people underscores the importance of investigating this allegation as quickly as possible," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"As has been well documented," he continued, "the Assad regime continues to terrorize the people of Syria through indiscriminate airstrikes, barrel bombings, arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence, murder, and starvation. The Assad regime must be held accountable for such atrocious behavior."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The Obama administration is supporting the moderate Syrian opposition fighting Assad in the ongoing Syrian civil war but has been reluctant to take direct action against the regime even as it fights the terror group ISIS in the northern part of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>While President Barack Obama had once labeled Syrian use of chemical weapons a "red line," he backed away from using military force to apply it in 2013 after running into opposition from Congress, and he has since made no signs of renewing that threat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>In an interview with CBS last week, Kerry said he would be willing to negotiate with the Assad regime to bring about a political solution to the conflict, though the State Department later clarified they see "no future" for Assad in Syria.</td></tr>
