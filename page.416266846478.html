<h3>Google fights EU abuse case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GOOGLE has hit back after the European Commission accused the company of abusing its dominance of the internet search market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The US giant has been served with a charge sheet alleging it broke EU antitrust rules by "systematically favouring" its own comparison shopping product in its general search results pages, stifling competition and harming consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Commission has also opened a separate probe into Google's Android mobile operating system, which will determine whether it has entered into anti-competitive agreements or abused its dominant position in services for smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>EU Commissioner in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager, right, said: "I am concerned that the company has given an unfair advantage to its own comparison shopping service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Google now has the opportunity to convince the Commission to the contrary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On the Android probe, she added: "Smartphones, tablets and similar devices play an increasing role in many people's daily lives and I want to make sure the markets in this area can flourish without anticompetitive constraints imposed by any company."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The verdict of a Commission investigation opened in 2010 was that the comparison service Google Shopping was given favourable treatment by being shown more prominently on screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It added: "Users do not necessarily see the most relevant results in response to queries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Commission can levy fines of up to 10 per cent of Google's global turnover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Google has been given 10 weeks to respond and can then seek a formal hearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Google Search senior vice president Amit Singhal said: "We strongly disagree with the need to issue a statement of objections and look forward to making our case over the weeks ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While Google may be the most used search engine, people can now find and access information in numerous different ways.</td></tr>
