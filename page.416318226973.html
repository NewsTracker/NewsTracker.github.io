<h3>First attack on US in Iraq since Islamic State took Mosul</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A man talks on his phone at the aftermath of a car bomb in the northern city of Erbil, Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Erbil, Iraq - A suicide bomber struck the US consulate building in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil on Friday afternoon, the first assault on US facilities since Islamic State emerged as a force in Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kurdish authorities said at least three people were killed - a Kurdish security official said the dead were the three attackers - and five wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Among the wounded were two Westerners in a restaurant across the street, witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brett McGurk, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, said in a post on Twitter that all consulate personnel had been accounted for and that there were no reports of injuries among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He included the hashtag VBIED, short for vehicle-born improvised explosive device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>IS, which is also pressing offensives in the cities of Ramadi and Baiji, claimed responsibility for the explosion in an internet post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The attack was the first direct assault on US facilities in Iraq since IS took control of much of the northern and central areas of the country in last northern summer, and only the second bombing in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Regional Government, a city considered so safe the United States moved many of its diplomats in from Baghdad when IS t captured the city of Mosul and threatened Baghdad last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Kurdish official at the scene said three attackers had approached a checkpoint near the consulate in an SUV, apparently intending to attack on foot to make room for a suicide bomber, who was either also on foot or in the car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They were spotted by peshmerga security forces stationed outside the consulate, who opened fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The security official said the three attackers were killed, though whether they were killed by gunshots or detonated explosives was unclear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gunfire was heard in the area for several minutes after an initial explosion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The heavily guarded facility, which houses diplomats and a military command centre used to co-ordinate the air campaign led by the US against the IS, is in a quiet residential and predominantly Christian section of the Kurdish capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's accessible only through a heavily guarded pedestrian entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The facility is one of three key command centres that co-ordinate operations among the Iraqi and Kurdish governments - which operate independent security forces in the fight against IS - and the US-led coalition, which provides air support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was unknown whether the attack in Erbil was intended to disrupt the coalition response to the significant IS offensives unfolding elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>One is in the western province of Anbar, where the provincial capital of Ramadi is in danger of being overrun, and the other is in Baiji, where IS is trying to take control of Iraq's largest oil refinery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Iraqi government described the explosion in Erbil as due to an improvised explosive device on the road outside the consulate - a description that may mean a car bomb or one carried by an a person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The explosion was followed by heavy gunfire from security forces, who claimed to have been engaging other gunmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kurdish peshmerga, along with Kurdish internal security forces, quickly closed off the area as fires raged through a strip mall of coffee shops and restaurants opposite the consulate that are popular with Erbil's expatriate community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A US military helicopter circled the area as at least three ambulances evacuated wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>One peshmerga guard could be seen being loaded into a pickup by his comrades as security forces attempted to disperse bystanders and journalists from the area by frequently firing automatic weapons into the air.</td></tr>
