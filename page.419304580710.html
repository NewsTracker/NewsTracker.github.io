<h3>Ecuador's Cotopaxi volcano spews ash south of Quito</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) - A 2-mile-high (5-kilometer-high) plume of ash shot out of the Cotopaxi volcano near Ecuador's capital Friday in two pre-dawn blasts, coating highways, homes and cars with a fine gray powder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Government scientists said the 5,987-meter (19,600-foot) snow-capped volcano doesn't seem to be on the verge of a major eruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Authorities nevertheless restricted access to the park that surrounds Cotopaxi and suspended ascents of the peak, which is popular with mountaineers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Patricio Ramon of Ecuador's geophysics institute told Teleamazonas TV that the explosions were small phreatic eruptions, which occur when molten rock, or magma, meets water and produces a violent steam release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The situation merits the population staying informed about what's happening with the volcano," said Ramon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The volcano is 30 miles (50 kilometers) from Quito.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It began showing renewed activity in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Its last major eruption was in 1877.</td></tr>
