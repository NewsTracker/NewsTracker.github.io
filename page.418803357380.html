<tr><td>26</td><td>"We thank you for concentrating your time and attention on football above all, despite this."</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>Blatter was re-elected FIFA president two days later with support from Putin, who hinted the United States was meddling in football's affairs to help strip Russia of the 2018 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Within a week Blatter had stunningly announced he would leave the office he has held since 1998 after a new election to replace him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It is on Feb. 26.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Blatter could be interviewed for the Swiss case - which centers on suspected money laundering linked to the 2018 and 2022 bid contests - and is a stated target of American investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He denies all wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Russia bid leaders have also denied wrongdoing though provided little evidence requested by FIFA's ethics committee in a previous probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>That case concluded that wrongdoing by several bid candidates did not influence the victories of Russia and 2022 host Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Sport mixed with politics in one part of the draw as the U.S. will travel during regional group play to Trinidad and Tobago, where indicted former FIFA vice president Jack Warner is fighting extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>On the field, Germany will start defending its World Cup title in a six-team pool where the Czech Republic seems the biggest barrier to advancing as group winner.</td></tr>
