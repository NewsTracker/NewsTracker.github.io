<h3>Tunisia arrests 23 in 'terror cell' over museum attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tunisia said Thursday that it has arrested 23 suspects in connection with last week's jihadist massacre at the country's national museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Twenty-three suspects including a woman have been arrested as part of a terrorist cell" involved in the attack, Interior Minister Najem Gharsalli told journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Those arrested were all Tunisians, and they accounted for "80 percent of this cell," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Another Tunisian, two Moroccans and an Algerian suspected of being members of the cell were on the run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Tunisian fugitive, Maher Ben Mouldi Kaidi, is alleged to have provided the automatic weapons to the two gunmen who killed 21 people -- including 20 foreign tourists -- at the Bardo museum in Tunis on March 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The head of the cell was among those arrested and identified as Mohamed Emine Guebli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the minister said the operation was organised by an Algerian jihadist named Lokmane Abou Sakhr, one of the leaders of the Al-Qaeda-linked Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, the main Tunisian armed group active along the border with Algeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Officials called into question the claim of responsibility for the attack from Al-Qaeda's jihadist rival, the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Islamic State praised this attack for propaganda and publicity. But on the ground it was Okba Ibn Nafaa which belongs to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb that organised and committed this crime," interior ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>AQIM has not responded since IS claimed responsibility for the attack, which would be its first in Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tunisian authorities have blamed Okba Ibn Nafaa for a series of ambushes and attacks against security forces that have left some 60 dead since the end of 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The 23 suspects were to appear in court later Thursday, Gharsalli said, without providing further details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The minister said eight of the foreign tourists were killed as they got off a bus in front of the museum and 12 others inside the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A Tunisian policeman was also killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The attack was the worst on foreigners in Tunisia since an Al-Qaeda suicide bombing of a synagogue killed 21 people on the island of Djerba in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Authorities are organising an international march "against terrorism" in Tunis on Sunday, similar to the one in Paris that followed the January attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly and a kosher supermarket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>French President Francois Hollande is among those who have announced they will attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>President Beji Caid Essebsi has called for a huge turnout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I am calling on all Tunisians young and old... to take part in this march to show Tunisia's strength and its willingness to fight terrorism," he said in a televised address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The culture ministry said the Bardo museum would receive visits by school groups on Friday and then open to the general public for the day on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The attack dealt a heavy blow to Tunisia's vital tourism industry as the country looks to rebuild its economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The birthplace of the Arab Spring revolutionary movement, Tunisia has seen an upsurge in Islamic extremism since overthrowing longtime strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Tunisia has taken pride in forming a democratic government since the Arab Spring -- in marked contrast to countries such as Egypt, Libya and Yemen.</td></tr>
