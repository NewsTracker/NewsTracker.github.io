<li>Prince Ali expects sponsors to snub FIFA if Blatter stays</li>
<li>FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali bin al-Hussein believes the scandal-hit organization will struggle to replace sponsors and be hurt financially if Sepp Blatter remains in charge.</li>
<li>But Prince Ali of Jordan has used his FIFA manifesto, which was launched on Monday, to express concerns that corruption allegations around FIFA are putting off commercial backers.</li>
<li>"We should have a situation where sponsors are not only willing to come back but we should have sponsors fighting to sponsor FIFA," Prince Ali said in an interview with The Associated Press.</li>
<li>"FIFA is riding on the success of the World Cup," Prince Ali said from Cairo where he is campaigning at a Confederation of African Football meeting.</li>
<li>FIFA said in January it was in "advanced negotiations" with potential partners for the 2018 World Cup, but no information on new sponsors have been announced since then.</li>

<li>Platini: FIFA led by Blatter will always lack credibility</li>
<li>Ahead of the FIFA presidential election on Friday, Platini said the 79-year-old Blatter had no grand plans for FIFA and it was "not credible" to claim he needed a fifth four-year term to complete an unfinished mission.</li>
<li>"No, he is simply scared of the future, as he has given his life to the institution, to the point where he now identifies himself fully with FIFA," Platini said.</li>

<li>He opted last August not to challenge Blatter in the election of 209 FIFA member federations and now supports the only opponent: FIFA vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan.</li>
