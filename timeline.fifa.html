<li>GENEVA (AP) - Chuck Blazer was banned for life by FIFA's ethics committee on Thursday for widespread corruption, finally ending the career of the longtime most senior American in world football.</li>
<li>FIFA's ethics panel made its ruling using evidence from the American federal case which has plunged FIFA and international football into crisis.</li>
