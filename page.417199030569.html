<h3>Redacted words more trouble for Hillary Clinton than released emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and aide Huma Abedin (left) in New Hampshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Washington: It wasn't the 296 emails released on Friday that caused the most trouble for Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was the sentence and a half in one that was redacted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After months of review, the administration published messages the US Presidential hopeful exchanged about the deadly attacks in Benghazi, Libya, with her colleagues and friends while she was secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Those memos contained none of the evidence to bolster critics who say she withheld security for the US outpost there or deliberately misled the public about the ties between the attackers and al-Qaeda terrorists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hillary Clinton orders ice cream during a stop at in Derry, New Hampshire on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, on the day of its scheduled release, the State Department, at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, labelled a part of a November 2012 email to her about arrests in the Benghazi killings as classified, and kept it secret.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That's a problem for Mrs Clinton because she said the private email address she chose to use while secretary was never the vehicle for classified information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While the information wasn't classified when she received it, the subsequent categorisation gave ammunition to critics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's "troubling that highly sensitive information, now deemed classified, was put at risk on her off-the-books server," Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Until she hands over the secret sever to an independent investigator, the American people will never get the truth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hillary Clinton on her second visit to New Hampshire since announcing her candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The email, from aide Jacob Sullivan on November 18, 2012, relayed information on the arrest of suspects in the fatal attack two months earlier on the US outpost in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Sullivan's email was deemed classified two and a half years after it was sent, according to a note attached to the email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>No reason was given for the reclassification.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mrs Clinton, as secretary of state from 2009 until February 2013, used a private email account that was routed through a server at her suburban New York home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Now a Democratic presidential candidate, Mrs Clinton has defended using the private address, and said on Friday that all the messages had been handled properly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I'm aware that the FBI has asked that a portion of one email be held back," she told reporters after a campaign stop in New Hampshire for her presidential bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"That happens in the process of Freedom of Information Act responses, but that doesn't change the fact that all of the information in the emails was handled appropriately."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The State Department said the former secretary didn't violate any law by using the private email or handling the message from her aide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This information was not classified at the time" the email was written, Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>While the FBI has now upgraded information in that email to classified, "the occurrence of a subsequent upgrade does not mean anyone did anything wrong," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mrs Clinton's emails about the September 11, 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi had been shared with the congressional committee investigating those events months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in an assault on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi and a separate attack on a nearby Central Intelligence Agency outpost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The emails we release today do not change the essential facts or our understanding of the events before, during, or after the attacks," Ms Harf said in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The 296 emails posted on a department website are a fraction of more than 30,000 work-related messages Clinton turned over from her private email server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The emails released show the initial outpouring of support for how Clinton handled the events from friends, former officials and, even, sometimes foes such as Arizona Senator John McCain, a Republican.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>They also show Mrs Clinton closely watching how the deaths were covered and discussed in the media, and attuned to whether they could provide political fodder to Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Many of the emails were sent from long-time Mrs Clinton friend and adviser Sidney Blumenthal, who was also helping American businessmen looking for government contracts in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Citing what he called secret sources in the country, Mr Blumenthal initially said the attacks were spontaneous, but two days later sent a detailed memo that said terrorists had been planning the assault for a month, and then took advantage of the demonstrations as a cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mrs Clinton forwarded to her State Department colleagues many of the emails from Mr Blumenthal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>As media reports began to criticise the protection afforded the US complex, and Republicans said that the Obama administration was deliberately downplaying the links between terrorists and the attacks, the emails show that Mrs Clinton's staff prepared a detailed list of all of her statements about Benghazi, and reviewed the disputed comments from then United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice on television news shows the week after the assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"You never said spontaneous or characterised the motives, in fact you were careful in your first statement to say we were assessing motive and method," Mr Sullivan wrote in an email on September 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>One month after Mr Sullivan sent Mrs Clinton Ms Rice's television transcript, she forwarded the note to an aide with a short request: "Pls print."</td></tr>
