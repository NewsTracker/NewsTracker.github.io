<h3>Wounded Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have to give up control of jihadists</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Future in doubt: The leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was reportedly paralysed by a US air strike in Iraq on March 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Cairo: The leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been so badly wounded by a US air strike in Iraq that he may never resume control of the group he masterminded to power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to reports, Mr Baghdadi has been incapacitated since March 18 due to spinal damage, suffered when an air strike hit a three-car convoy in which he was travelling through the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, close to the Syrian border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The enigmatic jihadist leader is being treated by two ideologically sympathetic doctors who travel to his hideout from the group's stronghold in the Iraqi city of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His location remains a closely guarded secret.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Protesters carry defaced posters of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, left, and Iraqi Defence Minister Khaled al-Obeidi, right, as they chant slogans against the Islamic State group during a protest in Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Baghdadi's wounds were said to be life-threatening initially, prompting urgent meetings among the leadership in order to name his successor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Operational control of IS has reportedly been passed to Abu Alaa al-Afri, a physics professor and longtime senior official, who had been appointed deputy leader when his predecessor was killed by another air strike late last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Also known as Haji Iman, Mr Afri taught in the northwestern Iraqi city of Tal Afar, and has reportedly built solid respect among Islamic State's senior leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Afri is thought to have acted as the link between Mr Baghdadi, his inner circle, and IS's network of emirs across their self-proclaimed caliphate, spanning large swathes of Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Hisham al-Hashimi, senior adviser on Isis to the Iraqi government described Mr Afri as the "strongest man in [IS] after Baghdadi".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The injury of Baghdadi hasn't affected operations yet, but [his replacement] could see the beginning of disputes between IS's foreign fighters and its Iraqis," Mr Hishimi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Baghdadi has been a towering figure in the rise of IS, and its al-Qaeda affiliated predecessor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Their big strategic moves have all been masterminded by Baghdadi, even if others have helped with the specifics," said Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, a Fellow at the Middle East Forum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Afri is understood to be more open to the prospect of reconciliation between Isil and Jabhat al-Nusra, a rival al-Qaeda affiliated group in Syria which has led rebel forces to impressive gains in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The last known communique bearing Mr Baghdadi's name came last week, calling on jihadists to send reinforcements to the Iraqi provinces of Anbar and Salahedin.</td></tr>
