<h3>Amid crisis and ahead of vote, Blatter calls for 'unity' at FIFA</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA President Sepp Blatter reacts after a break during the 65th FIFA Congress in Zurich on May 29, 2015 in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sepp Blatter told members of world football's governing body on Friday that they must help "fix FIFA right now" amidst allegations of corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>World soccer boss Sepp Blatter was expected to be re-elected on Friday, defying growing calls for him to step down in the face of corruption scandals engulfing the sport's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Addressing FIFA delegates at the body's annual congress in Switzerland, where members will later vote to decide the organization's presidency, Blatter promised more transparency and urged members to remain unified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He also said that FIFA would probably not be facing its present problems if Russia and Qatar had not been awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Today, I am appealing to unity and team spirit so we can move forward together," he said, in a low key-address that contrasted with his more defiant reaction on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Blatter also sought to distance himself from the scandal, the biggest crisis FIFA has faced in its 111-year history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Wednesday, U.S. authorities indicted 14 people on bribery, racketeering, fraud and money-laundering charges going back to the 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Seven of the officials -- including two serving FIFA vice presidents - were arrested in Zurich on Wednesday ahead of the congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The two criminal investigations have cast a new shadow on Blatter's 17-year reign as president of FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 209 FIFA member nations will decide later Friday whether to stick with the 79-year-old Blatter or vote for Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, 39, of Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Amid the dramatic build up to the election, UEFA president Michel Platini appealed to Blatter to immediately step down - calls the president has rejected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I am willing to accept the president of FIFA is responsible for everything but I would at least like to share that responsibility with everyone," Blatter said in a presidential address on Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We cannot constantly supervise everyone in football...you cannot ask everyone to behave ethically."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Blatter's opening address to the congress was briefly disrupted by a pro-Palestinian activist, who held up a red card and shouted "Red card to racism."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The protest was to draw attention to a campaign that aims to stop Palestinian players from being detained by Israeli security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But hours later, the Palestinian Football Association - which had called for suspending Israel from FIFA - decided to drop its bid to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>After calling for security, Blatter announced: "I would ask you to please check the access points of this room."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Meanwhile, Britain's Serious Fraud Office said on Friday it was examining information relating to possible corruption at FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The SFO continues actively to assess material in its possession and has made plain that it stands ready to assist ongoing international criminal investigations," a spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The SFO has not launched a formal criminal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Also on Friday, Swiss police said a bomb threat has been made against the venue where the FIFA congress is being held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Zurich city police spokesman Peter Sahli says a police operation is ongoing but declined to provide further details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>FIFA secretary-general Jerome Valcke said "an anonymous threat against the FIFA congress was received."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The meeting then resumed after lunch.</td></tr>
