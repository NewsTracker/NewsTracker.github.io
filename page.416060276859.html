<h3>Pakistan judge: Charge CIA lawyer, agent for drone strike</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>S. drone attacks in Pakistani tribal areas on al-Qaida and Taliban hideouts, in Islamabad, Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A Pakistani judge on Tuesday, April 7, 2015, ordered criminal charges be filed against a former top CIA lawyer who oversaw its drone program and a former station chief in Islamabad over a 2009 strike that killed two people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Former acting general counsel John A. Rizzo and ex-station chief Jonathan Bank must face charges including murder, conspiracy, waging war against Pakistan and terrorism, Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui of the Islamabad High Court ruled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FILE - In this Thursday, Oct. 27, 2011 file photo, Pakistani tribal elder Karim Khan shows the remains of a missile reportedly fired by a U.S. drone on a village in north Waziristan, killing many people, after his news conference in Islamabad, Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>ISLAMABAD (AP) - A Pakistani judge on Tuesday ordered criminal charges be filed against a former top CIA lawyer who oversaw its drone program and a former station chief in Islamabad over a 2009 strike that killed two people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A court clerk and a lawyer involved the case, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, confirmed details of the judge's ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rizzo and Bank could not be immediately reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The CIA declined to immediately comment when reached by The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Bank fled Pakistan in 2010 after his cover was blown when a Pakistani man named Kareem Khan initially threatened to sue the CIA and others for $500 million over the deaths of his 18-year-old son, Zaenullah Khan, and his brother, Asif Iqbal, in a purported Dec. 31, 2009, strike on the North Waziristan tribal region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The AP and other media organizations reported at the time that three people were killed in a missile attack that day in Mir Ali in North Waziristan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Pakistani intelligence officials said then that the men were militants, but offered no proof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As the outrage over the lawsuit grew, protesters in Islamabad began carrying placards bearing Bank's name as listed in the lawsuit, urging him to leave the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The CIA didn't move Bank, who had previously served in Baghdad, until he began receiving death threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The station chief's outing spurred questions at the time of whether Pakistan's spy service might have leaked the information, something the Pakistanis denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The disclosure didn't prevent Bank from landing another sensitive job: He became chief of the Iran operations division at CIA headquarters at Langley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He later was removed from that post after CIA officials concluded he created a hostile work environment in the division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He has since been detailed to the Pentagon's intelligence arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Rizzo was the CIA's acting general counsel overseeing its drone program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He later left the agency and wrote a book about his experiences at the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The CIA's drone strike program killed Pakistani Taliban fighters and other militants hiding in its tribal regions, but caused major anger across Pakistan over civilian casualties from the strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Since 2004, the U.S. has carried out nearly 400 suspected drone strikes in the country, according to the New America Foundation's International Security Program, which tracks the American campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The foundation says the last U.S. drone strike in Pakistan happened on Jan. 29, which killed at least six suspected militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It's not clear how the judge's ruling will affect relations between Pakistan and the U.S., especially over the drone program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>While Pakistan's government often decries the strikes, many believe it allows them in order to target the militants that threaten it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Massive protests against the drone program previously have blocked a land route used by NATO forces to resupply troops in neighboring Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Any legal action stands no chance of success unless U.S. officials cooperate with the court, something highly unlikely given the secretive nature of the missile strike program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The CIA rarely publicly discusses its drone program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Under the judge's order, Pakistan's federal police force must file the charges against the two former CIA officials, though they've so far refused over what lawyers describe as a reluctance to upset the country's diplomatic relations with the U.S. Pakistani police officials could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Pakistani lawyer Khawaja Naveed Ahmed, who is not involved in the case, said the government also could appeal the judge's order to a higher court to try and stop having to file the charges.</td></tr>
