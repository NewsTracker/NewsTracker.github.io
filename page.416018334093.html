<h3>IMF says Greece confirms it will repay 450 million euro loan due later this week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Greece's finance minister has told the International Monetary Fund chief that his country will repay a loan from the organization that is due this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Yanis Varoufakis met in Washington on Sunday for an "informal discussion" on the debt-stricken nation's reform program, an IMF statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greece is in difficult negotiations with creditors over its bailout program, which has delayed the disbursement of a 7.2 billion euro ($7.9 billion) aid tranche.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That has led to a cash crunch, forcing the government to tap reserves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We both agreed that effective cooperation is in everyone's interest," Lagarde said in the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We noted that continuing uncertainty is not in Greece's interest."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greece must repay a 450 million euro IMF loan installment on Thursday.</td></tr>
