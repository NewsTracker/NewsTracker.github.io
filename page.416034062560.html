<h3>Boko Haram disguised as preachers kill at least 24 in Nigeria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The attackers arrived in cars late on Sunday and gathered people at a mosque in the remote village of Kwajafa, pretending to preach Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They then opened fire on them, witness Simeon Buba said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The group fighting for an Islamic state has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds, although a military operation against them by Nigeria and neighbours Chad, Cameroon and Niger in the past two months has wrested back much of the territory it controlled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"People didn't know the Boko Haram men came for attack because they lied to our people that they came for preaching," said Buba in a telephone conversation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They opened fire on them and killed many people," he said, adding that houses were set on fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Some people were being treated for gunshot wounds and burns at a hospital in the Borno state town of Biu on Monday, a source there said.</td></tr>
