<h3>Cyclone Pam: Huge storm heading for tiny South Pacific island of Vanuatu</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cyclone Pam was due to hit the island's capital, Port Vila, at around 11pm Friday (12 noon GMT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The anticipated category five storm, with predicted wind gusts of more than 280km/h, prompted evacuations across the country as aid agencies warned of torrential rain, landslides and flash flooding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Cyclone Pam has already hit Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Solomon Islands, causing significant damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>According to The Guardian, local sources reported that "panic" was setting in ahead of the extreme weather, with hotels ordering guests into underground bunkers, and 12 evacuation centres swiftly filling up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Unicef, which has aid workers and supplies on the ground in Vanuatu, warned that 260,000 people were in the middle of the potential disaster zone as the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office announced a red alert in the major northern provinces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It urged residents to seek immediate shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Care Vanuatu's program manager Charlie Damon told the newspaper that one of her colleagues had helped 195 people into evacuation centres alone, including three people with disabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He did say there was a bit of panic in the centre,"she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They're nervous, particularly with the noise because there's more rubbish flying around [in Port Vila]. On the other islands it's tree branches and coconuts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She said that the teams had made sure of access to water, employed young people to cook and cut down surrounding trees and had designated single-sex toilets "for the protection of women and children".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Unicef's Pacific spokeswoman, Alice Clements, said that the cyclone could create large storm surges which "behave pretty much like a tsunami", TVNZ reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She said that conditions were getting "wilder by the minute" in Port Vila and warned that houses on the country's outer islands, which are traditionally made of light timber with thatched roofs, were unlikely to stand up to the storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Vanuatu Meteorological Service's acting director, David Gibson, told The Guardian that Pam would be the most powerful storm ever to bear down on Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"As far as I can remember, this is the first [category five] cyclone to come very close to Vanuatu," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"This is obviously a once-in-a-lifetime experience for most of us."</td></tr>

<h3>U.N. resumes Libyan consultations without recognized parliament</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The U.N. envoy to the North African country said on Friday the talks had been delayed to next Thursday to give "time to all parties to prepare for the final stages" of the dialogue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The goal of negotiations is to achieve a unity government and a lasting ceasefire, and put Libya's democratic transition back on track four years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But both administrations face internal splits over the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Delegates from the internationally recognized House of Representative were absent from the Moroccan costal town of Skhirat, where the talks had been planned for this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That parliament had asked to postpone the talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The HoR has decided to reinforce its team by adding new members and new advisers," the U.N. envoy to Libya, Bernardino Leon, told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I hope all the parties will return for the final stages of these talks next Thursday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Delegates from the rival administration of an armed group that seized control of the capital Tripoli last August were present and held talks with Leon, a spokesman for the U.N. Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Western leaders support the U.N. talks as the only way to end the turmoil in Libya, where Islamist militants have gained ground in the chaos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But in a sign of how far apart the sides remain, representatives of the Tripoli faction on Friday asked the United Nations for its official position on Khalifa Haftar, a former Gaddafi ally who has been named army chief for the internationally recognized government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Haftar began a self-declared war on Islamist militants last year and has gathered support in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But his critics in Tripoli say he is a Gaddafi loyalist whose presence damages chances of a peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have asked the U.N. envoy for an official position on the appointment of a war criminal as the commander of the Libyan army," said Omar Hmeidan, a spokesman for Tripoli's parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Leon said he had not read the request yet, and the "talks are not discussing that issue (Haftar's appointment)".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Friday's session was the second round of UNSMIL-sponsored consultations in Skhirat, after several rounds in Geneva and elsewhere.</td></tr>
