<h3>Political agreement paves the way for new Nepal constitution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) " Nepal's main political parties have reached agreements on several disputed issues that could lead to the drafting of a much-delayed constitution in the Himalayan nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The agreement was signed by leaders of the four main political parties after hours of negotiations at Prime Minister Sushil Koirala's residence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The agreement says Nepal would have eight federal states but the names and exact borders will be decided later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Partisan political fighting has delayed an agreement on the constitution, which was initially supposed to have been drafted by 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nepal has had an interim constitution since pro-democracy protests forced then King Gyanendra to give up authoritarian rule and turn Nepal into a republic.</td></tr>
