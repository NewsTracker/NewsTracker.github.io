<h3>HSBC drops out of Apple Pay UK Launch and people are very ANGRY</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>APPLE has debuted Apple Pay to customers across the UK - but those who bank with HSBC will have to wait a little longer than expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple Pay - the contactless payment solution built into the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch - has launched in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The system means iPhone users can "tap-to-pay" using their smartphones for the first time, and many have been testing out the new system for the first time this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However - HSBC's 16 million UK customers have been forced to wait for the new payment solution after the bank missed the launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>HSBC, which leaked the Apple Pay release date in a tweet this week, was initially confirmed to be amongst the first banks to offer the Apple-branded contactless solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the British banking firm was quietly moved from the "participating bank" to "coming soon" on the Apple Pay website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>HSBC said it would allow customers to use Apply Pay by the end of July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Thousands of angry customers have taken to Twitter to complain about the sudden change of plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A spokesperson for the bank told the BBC: "We are working hard to bring this to our customers by the end of July."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Those who bank with First Direct - a subsidiary of HSBC - will also have to wait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>HSBC and First Direct customers are not the only people unable to add their credit and debit cards to Apple Pay this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Lloyds Bank, M&S Bank, MBNA and TSB have all announced plans to support Apple Pay later this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Barclays - which has its own wearable payment solution - today changed its turn and announced support for Apple's iPhone payment system "in the future".</td></tr>
