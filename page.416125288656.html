<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The unnamed man recently returned from West Africa and developed the symptoms on Friday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ACT Health Acting Chief Health Officer Dr Andrew Pengilley said he worked as a medical professional in Liberia where there had been a large number of Ebola cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Due to the low number of cases in Liberia recently, the person did not treat any cases of Ebola," he said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Under ACT health procedures, the man had been monitored since his return to Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"What we do know is that a person who is being monitored by ACT Health has had minor changes in their health," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dr Pengilley said he would be treated for Ebola and until that proved negative, it would be handled as a worst-case scenario.</td></tr>
