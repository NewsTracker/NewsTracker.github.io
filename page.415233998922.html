<h3>Boko Haram killing men, tribes linked to Chad, witnesses say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The fighters separated and killed people of the Shuwa Arab community, which spreads across the border between Chad and Nigeria, while sparing people from the Kanuri tribe to which most Boko Haram militants belong, according to Mohammed Seit, a resident of Kala Balge village.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"They gathered the people in the market, and then separated the Kanuris from the Shuwa Arabs; then they informed the Shuwa Arabs that it was your tribesmen of Chad that are tormenting (Boko Haram)," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The militants said they were on a "revenge mission and to send message to your brothers the Chadians."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Scores have been killed and homes in dozens of villages burned down in the past five days, Seit said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nigeria's neighbor, Chad, has spearheaded a regional offensive and seized back major towns bordering Cameroon from Boko Haram in recent weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a separate attack Tuesday, at least 68 men and boys were killed in an attack on the rural community of Njaba, about 80 miles southeast of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, witnesses said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We, the women, were spared but every male including children of 12, 13 and 14 years old were killed," said resident Aminatu Mommodu.</td></tr>

<h3>In D.C., Sledding Commences on Capitol Hill</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Snow in the nation's capital came this close Thursday to turning a group of kids into juvenile delinquents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>You see, sledding isn't allowed on the Capitol grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In fact, according to CNN, sledding hasn't been allowed there since 1876, when a rule was instituted that "prevent[ed] any portion of the Capitol Grounds and terraces from being used as playground or otherwise, so far as may be necessary to protect the public property, turf and grass from destruction or injury."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But on Wednesday, with snow again in the forecast, a group of locals created a Change.org petition to get the U.S. Capitol Police to lift the ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting delegate, did her part by writing a letter to Frank J. Larkin, chairman of the Capitol Police Board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Larkin replied that the board could not grant exceptions and lift the ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>That didn't stop District residents from showing up anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And the media, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>#breaking Civil Disobedience on Capitol Hill as people sled at the Capitol in defiance of US Capitol Police orders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Capitol Police, at one point, showed up with copies of the no-sledding rule, according to Washington City Paper's Will Sommer, before shutting the whole thing down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>US Capitol Police shut down sledding on Capitol Hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But in the end, cooler heads prevailed and the kids were allowed their fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>No enforcement of #sledding ban on Capitol Hill today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Thank you Capitol Police!</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Glad Capitol Police dropped the "get off my lawn" routine and let the kids go sledding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It's the people's lawn.</td></tr>
