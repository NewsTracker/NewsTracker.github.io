<h3>Nigerian to lead multinational force fighting Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nigeria on Wednesday named one of its generals to take over the multinational force fighting Boko Haram, suggesting a desire by the country's newly elected president to take the lead in the war against the Islamic extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Nigerian army "remains a virile fighting force ... capable of routing Boko Haram," Buhari declared Wednesday on a visit to Niger, which is contributing troops and is hosting hundreds of thousands of Nigerian refugees from the insurgent violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Maj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai has already assumed his new duties commanding troops from Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger, according to the Ministry of Defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Buratai was a director at Defense Headquarters and has served as the commandant of the Nigerian Army School of Infantry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The appointment comes on President Muhammadu Buhari's fourth day in office and the day before he is scheduled to visit N'Djamena, the Chadian capital that is the force's headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Before his election, Buhari, a retired major general who was briefly a military dictator in the 1980s, had said the presence of foreign troops in Nigeria was "a national disgrace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He has promised to cooperate fully with neighbors Chad and Niger, which had complained that a lack of cooperation was hampering the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The multinational army, with battle-hardened Chadian troops taking the lead, this year drove Boko Haram from northeastern towns where they had declared an Islamic caliphate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the Chadian troops have had to several times retake some Nigerian towns seized back from Boko Haram because Nigerian troops did not arrive to secure them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Despite the setbacks, the insurgents continue hit-and-run attacks and suicide bombings from a northeastern forest stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Buhari said his visits to Chad and Niger are to seek even more support to bring an end to the extremist group's atrocities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some 13,000 people have been killed and 1.5 million driven from their homes in the nearly 6-year-old Islamic uprising that spilled over Nigeria's northeastern borders.</td></tr>
