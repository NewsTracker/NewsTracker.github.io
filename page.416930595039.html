<h3>As self-driving cars arrive, liability an issue; Google acknowledges 11 accidents in 6 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES - The self-driving cars that Google Inc. has been testing on California's roads and highways were involved in 11 minor accidents over the past six years, according to the tech giant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company released the number Monday after The Associated Press reported that Google had notified California of three collisions involving its self-driving cars since September, when reporting all accidents became a legal requirement as part of the permits for the tests on public roads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The director of Google's self-driving car project wrote in a web post that all 11 accidents were minor - "light damage, no injuries" - and happened over 1.7 million miles of testing, including nearly 1 million miles in self-driving mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident," wrote Google's Chris Urmson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was not possible to independently verify Google's assertions about the fault and nature of the collisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company would not release accident documentation, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles said it could not discuss details, citing confidentiality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The agency has licensed just 48 of these test cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An accident caused by a self-driving car is a fear of the people developing them, whether at Google or one of the traditional automakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That's not just because if the accident is particularly horrific, public and political acceptance of the technology would suffer badly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's also because the reaction to the first car-caused accident will set a precedent in terms of financial liability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Assuming that you are not dead, you are in a much better positon than if you had been hit by an ordinary, human-driven vehicle," said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who has studied issues about the cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That's because the company behind the car will have deep pockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>California law makes it hard for any but major companies or very wealthy individual to test the cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Each one requires $5 million worth of insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Given the potential for bad publicity, the company will have strong incentive to settle any lawsuit quickly and generously, Smith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Three other states have passed laws welcoming tests of self-driving cars onto their roads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Regulators in Nevada, Michigan and Florida told The Associated Press that they weren't aware of any accidents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>If a car in self-driving mode hits a pedestrian, the case becomes a matter of product liability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>California law has a definition of a design defect that would favor a person who is hit, said Robert W. Peterson, insurance law expert and law professor at Santa Clara University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>If the car "fails to behave in a way which a reasonable consumer would expect it to behave, that is a defect," Peterson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The cars have a clear picture of their surroundings more than a football field away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If a person reasonably expects that one of the cars would stop rather than strike, that could create liability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Because the cars are required to record and store the last 30 seconds of a data before any accident, reconstructing what happened should be easier, at least.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Google has modified 23 Lexus SUVs registered with DMV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The parts supplier Delphi Automotive had one accident, which an accident report the company provided the AP showed was not its fault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Delphi said at the time the car was being driven by the person the DMV requires behind the wheel during testing.</td></tr>
