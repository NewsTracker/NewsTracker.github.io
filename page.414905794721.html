<h3>Christian bishop: I forgive ISIS</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Twenty-one Coptic Christians beheaded on a beach in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Christians across the world expressed horror and outrage at the mass killing, with Pope Francis calling the victims "martyrs" whose violent deaths should unite the fractured Christian community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bishop Angaelos, general bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Remarkably, though, a leading Coptic Christian bishop says that he has already forgiven the ISIS soldiers who slaughtered his fellow Copts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Bishop Angaelos, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom, was in Washington on Friday for the swearing-in of the United States' new ambassador-at-large for religious freedom, David Saperstein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Angaelos spoke to CNN about why ISIS targets Coptic Christians, and why he forgives them, even as he rejects their horrific acts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Q: What was the first thing that came to your mind when you heard about ISIS killing the Coptic Christians?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A: I suppose I had a sense of the inevitable happening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>We knew that it was going to happen by the way ISIS was sending out information about the captives, parading them on video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It was all very orchestrated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It was shocking to see how that could happen today in the 21st century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But we also saw strength and bravery in those men, and the number of messages and calls we've received in solidarity, the condolences and support has been overwhelming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This crime is not just a crime against Coptic Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It is a crime against humanity, and if there's anything we should stand for as human beings, first and foremost it's the sanctity of all human life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Q: Not long after the video released, you tweeted about the killings, using the hashtag #FatherForgive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Did you mean that you forgive ISIS?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A: Yes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It may seem unbelievable to some of your readers, but as a Christian and a Christian minister I have a responsibility to myself and to others to guide them down this path of forgiveness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>We don't forgive the act because the act is heinous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But we do forgive the killers from the depths of our hearts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Otherwise, we would become consumed by anger and hatred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It becomes a spiral of violence that has no place in this world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Q: You and many others had publicly prayed for ISIS to release the Copts and yet they were killed in a brutal manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>How do you maintain faith in God or in prayer after such a horrific outcome?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A: I learned a long time ago that when one prays, one prays for the best outcome, not knowing what that outcome would be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Of course, I prayed that they would be safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But I also prayed that, when the moment came, they would have the peace and strength to be able to get through it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It doesn't change my view of God that these 21 men died in this way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>They were sacrificed, but so much has come out of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>They brought the imminent dangers to marginalized peoples, not just Christians, but Yazidis and others in the Middle East, to the attention of the whole world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Q: This is not the first time ISIS had targeted Coptic Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Why do you think that is?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A: They made accusations in the video that Coptic crusaders were forcing women to convert to Christianity, which is totally unfounded and untrue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Coptic Christians were not part of the original Crusades and are not part of any crusade now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>We have lived peacefully and never taken up arms or forcibly converted anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But violent acts need to be justified and this is the justification they found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Q: You're in Washington today meeting with U.S. leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>What should they do about ISIS' persecution of Christians and other religious communities?</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>A: I would like to see us all start to work towards human rights generally, because when we're divided into different departments or organizations any change will be fragmented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>If you look at the rights of every individual, God-given rights, we can all start to work together and safeguard any people who are persecuted anywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Of course, the vast majority of persecution falls squarely right now on Christians in the Middle East and that needs to be addressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>But, as a Christian, I will never be comfortable just safeguarding the rights of Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>We need to help everyone.</td></tr>

<h3>White House Looks To Undercut Netanyahu Speech</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There are limits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Administration officials have discarded the idea of President Barack Obama himself giving an Iran-related address to rebut the two speeches Netanyahu is to deliver during his early March visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But other options remain on the table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Among them: a presidential interview with a prominent journalist known for coverage of the rift between Obama and Netanyahu, multiple Sunday show television appearances by senior national security aides and a pointed snub of America's leading pro-Israel lobby, which is holding its annual meeting while Netanyahu is in Washington, according to the officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The administration has already ruled out meetings between Netanyahu and Obama, saying it would be inappropriate for the two to meet so close to Israel's March 17 elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But the White House is now doubling down on a cold-shoulder strategy, including dispatching Cabinet members out of the country and sending a lower-ranking official than normal to represent the administration at the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Vice President Joe Biden will be away, his absence behind Netanyahu conspicuous in coverage of the speech to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other options were described by officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Netanyahu's plan for a March 3 address to a joint meeting of Congress has further strained already tense ties between the U.S. and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Congressional Republicans orchestrated Netanyahu's visit without consulting the White House or State Department, a move the Obama administration blasted as a break in diplomatic protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some Democratic lawmakers say they will boycott the speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>U.S. officials believe Netanyahu's trip to Washington is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, Obama's signature foreign policy objective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While Netanyahu has long been skeptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions that would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His opposition has intensified as negotiations go into overdrive with an end-of-March deadline for a framework deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I think this is a bad agreement that is dangerous for the state of Israel, and not just for it," Netanyahu said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The difference of opinion over the deal has become unusually rancorous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The White House and State Department have both publicly accused Israeli officials of leaking "cherry-picked" details of the negotiations to try to discredit the administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And, in extraordinary admissions this week, the administration acknowledged that the U.S. is withholding sensitive details of the talks from Israel, its main Middle East ally, to prevent such leaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The rebukes have only emboldened the leader of Israel, whose country Iran has threatened to annihilate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He has a double-barrel attack on the Iran talks ready for when he arrives in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Not only will he address Congress, he will also deliver similar remarks at the AIPAC conference, an event to which administrations past and present have traditionally sent top foreign policy officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>An AIPAC official said Friday that the group has not yet received any reply to its invitation for senior administration figures to attend the meeting that starts March 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The official stressed that last-minute RSVPs are not unusual, but the White House has been signaling for some time that a Cabinet-level guest may not coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Instead, the administration is toying with the idea of sending newly installed Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken to speak to the conference, according to officials familiar with internal discussions on the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But it's possible Treasury Secretary Jack Lew could attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, who have both previously addressed AIPAC, will be out of the country on foreign travel that appears to have been arranged to make them unavailable to speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Biden will be visiting Uruguay and Guatemala on a trip that was announced after Netanyahu's speech was scheduled, while the State Department announced abruptly this week that Kerry will be traveling to as-yet-determined destinations for the duration of the AIPAC conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Obama spoke to AIPAC in 2012, while he was in the midst of his re-election campaign.</td></tr>
