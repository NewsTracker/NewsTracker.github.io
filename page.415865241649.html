<h3>Source: Mullin to replace Lavin at St. John's (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- St. John's has decided its basketball future rests with the best of its past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chris Mullin, St. John's all-time leading scorer and still the face of its basketball program three decades after his career ended, has agreed to coach the Red Storm, a person with knowledge of the discussions told The Associated Press on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The person spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no formal announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mullin, who led St. John's to the Final Four in 1985, has never coached at any level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He replaces Steve Lavin who agreed to leave last week, after five seasons during which the Red Storm reached the NCAA Tournament twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Lavin had an 81-55 record at St. John's and the Red Storm went to the NCAA Tournament in his first and last seasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His teams compiled a 2-9 postseason record in the Big East Tournament, NCAA and NIT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lavin had one year left on his original six-year contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mullin, a New York native, was a five-time All-Star with Golden State, a member of the USA's gold-medal winning ''Dream Team'' in 1992 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He was presented for induction by his coach at St. John's, Hall of Famer Lou Carnesecca.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''This is a great day for St. John's, the whole university,'' Carnesecca said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''He has always represented St. John's well and I'm sure he'll do a fine job as coach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It was during Mullin's years at St. John's that the program enjoyed its greatest days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mullin and Georgetown's Patrick Ewing were the key parts of the early domination of the Big East Conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In 1985 the Big East had three Final Four teams, St. John's, Georgetown and national champion Villanova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Redmen and Hoyas were both ranked No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>1 during the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mullin and his sweet left-handed jumper became part of the lore of New York City basketball.</td></tr>
