<h3>'Chappie': Film Review</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Along with its innumerable other shortcomings, Chappie is one of the annoyingly growing number of films in which any and every character - here they run the gamut from techies to gangstas to robots - can instantly break into any computer system whenever they need to in about two seconds; a quick flurry of finger moves over the keyboard and they're invariably in, no problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Is there ever a movie in which characters do this and then can't get in?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This is but a minor irritant in a film well endowed with major ones, notably: unappealing one-note characters, retread concepts, implausible motivations and a ludicrous survival rate given the firepower expended upon the central figures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After the surprise and promise of District 9, this represents a further downward step for director Neill Blomkamp in the wake of the highly uneven Elysium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At least ever since the original RoboCop 28 years ago, audiences have come to grips with the notion of cyborg and/or mechanical crime fighters, and Chappie merely flips the equation, with geeky Johannesburg police force artificial intelligence engineer Deon (Dev Patel) announcing that one of his robot cops has crossed the line to become a thinking and feeling being.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This is too much for hard-line engineer Vincent (Hugh Jackman), who believes that the manmade soldiers are there to obey orders and not think for themselves; they have, after all, helped bring down the violent crime rate in Jo'burg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He's also devised a giant new crime buster named The Moose, which his boss, Michelle (Sigourney Weaver), refuses to activate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But you don't introduce a critter like this unless you intend to use him later on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Unfortunately, much of the interim time is spent in the company of a trio of unsavory punks who know little but how to strike menacing poses, shriek threats and brandish weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In deep on the wrong side of a debt to a local crime lord, skinny and stupid Ninja and motherly punk Yo-Landi (played by the self-same Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser of the rave rap group Die Antwoord), along with relatively even-keeled cohort Yankie (Jose Pablo Cantillo), manage to kidnap Chappie - whom Deon has just begun to teach about the human world - with the idea of using the robot to pull off a major heist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Chappie, a man-size construct made mostly of what looks like gunmetal, is an eager sponge at this early stage of life, absorbing and imitating everything he sees and hears like a child.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's supposed to be hilarious when, after his brief tutelage with the straitlaced Deon, Chappie begins speaking filthy and nasty like his new guardians, is adorned with gangsta-style bling and is taught how to be a cool badass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Instead, it comes off as cheap and even depressing, one more young soul lost to the underworld.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After persistently threatening Deon to within an inch of his life, the crims just let him go, even though he works with the cops and knows the location of the dump where the lowlifes live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Just as far-fetched is Vincent pulling a gun on Deon in the former's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But what permanently tips Chappie over from a drama that might deserve one's sympathetic charity to something ridiculous is a rant by Deon about the punks' pernicious influence on Chappie that ends with the young man fulminating that Ninja is nothing less than ... a philistine!</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Now that's telling him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ultimately, Chappie is pulled this way and that by people for whom he fills different roles: For Deon he's the invention of a lifetime; for Ninja and Yo-Landi, he's the child they'll never have; and for Vincent, he's the representation of what he hates, a sentient being rather than an unthinking soldier made to follow orders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And for the audience, Chappie is a charmless and irritating bugger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The way he's designed, with the barest semblance of a face, there's no entry point to invite human feelings for him, and his often frantic speech patterns are off-putting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley not only voiced the character but performed the role on-set so the other actors could relate to him, his character's actual look subsequently "painted" over the actor via CGI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The technique works flawlessly, but that doesn't make the character lovable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>As the action mounts toward the end, any sense of plausible logistics and physical realities are tossed aside, as characters just sort of magically get from point A to B and end up right where they need to be to force an encounter or showdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>When The Moose is finally unleashed, its destructive power proves rather less all-encompassing than suspected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And while the renegade, anti-establishment outlook of the director, who wrote the script with his District 9 partner Terri Tatchell, remains unmistakable, it's so pro forma and predictable here as to feel rote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>With the partial exception of Visser, whose punky veneer nicely melts into motherly concern and warmth, the actors are straitjacketed with unlikable characters notable for their ill-advised judgment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>No one's any fun here, even in their villainy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>With the exception of the police office, most of the action takes place in particularly unsavory sections of Jo'burg, and the film at times sports a wan video look, especially in certain daytime exteriors.</td></tr>

<h3>Mexico captures Zetas drug kingpin in another blow to cartels</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Omar Trevino, brother of captured ex-Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevino, was caught by soldiers and federal police in the northern city of Monterrey before dawn on Wednesday, National Security Commission Director Monte Alejandro Rubido told reporters at Mexico City's airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Trevino, looking overweight and in a light blue shirt, and four other men were paraded in front of the news media, their heads shoved down by soldiers and police, and escorted into camouflaged army vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"For the past few years, he's been one of the country's most-wanted delinquents, with an extremely violent profile," Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Trevino's arrest came just days after the capture of Servando Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug gang, who was the most-wanted crime boss still at large in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Zetas have been blamed for many of the bloodiest atrocities carried out by Mexican gangs in a wave of violence that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The gang has been weakened since the killing of former boss Heriberto Lazcano in 2012 and the capture of Miguel Angel Trevino in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rubido said the operation to catch Trevino began immediately after his brother's capture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By February, federal forces had begun closing in on him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Wednesday morning, they caught Trevino and four other men in two separate operations, Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>No shots were fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Trevino's capture bolsters Pena Nieto, who has seen his security record questioned following the likely murder of 43 trainee students in southwestern Mexico last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Mexican leader is currently on a visit to Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The United States, which alleges that Omar Trevino is responsible for several abductions and murders as well as cocaine smuggling, had offered up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Among the most notorious incidents pinned on the Zetas are the massacres of dozens of migrant workers, an arson attack on a Monterrey casino in 2011 that killed 52 and the dumping of 49 decapitated bodies near the same city in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Founded by army deserters in the late 1990s, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But the group struck out on its own in early 2010.</td></tr>
