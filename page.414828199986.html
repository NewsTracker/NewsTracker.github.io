<h3>Smoking numbers fall by 70,000</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The rate is now down to less than one fifth of the over 15 population - the largest annual drop in five years - compared to 21.5% in 2013 and 28% when the survey started in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to the research released by the Health Service Executive (HSE), the worst age group for smoking is 25 to 34-year-olds with a rate of 27.3%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The lowest levels were among 15 to 17-year-olds with a rate of just 7.9%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And the less well off in society also had some of the highest figures for tobacco use - almost one quarter of the poorest sections smoke according to the research.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Dave Molloy, National Tobacco Lead for the HSE, said the figures recording the largest annual drop since 2009 show the comprehensive tobacco control measures in Ireland are working.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"These changes are welcome, but there are still over 700,000 smokers in Ireland, and we see 5,200 tobacco related deaths annually - that's 15 deaths every day, and 100 families bereaved every week," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Ireland has set a target of being effectively smoke-free - a less than 5% prevalence - by 2025. To achieve this target the Tobacco Free Ireland policy includes a range of tobacco control initiatives to further denormalise smoking, stop our children starting to smoke and help smokers to quit."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Among them is to severely limit how tobacco is marketed in boxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Molloy added: "Ireland has shown great leadership in tobacco control, from the smoke-free workplace and point-of-sale legislation, to upcoming plans to introduce standardised packaging and protect children from second hand smoke in cars."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The smoking figures follow reports of warnings of a lawsuit by big tobacco if the Government presses ahead with its plans to introduce plain packaging for tobacco - effectively banning branded packets of cigarettes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The proposal, also being pursued in the UK, is under fire from at least 10 European countries who claim it contravenes international trade laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under EU rules, brands must be uniform to allow for free movement of goods and prevent barriers to trade while there are also rules governing the protection of intellectual property and trademarks, which may include logos and designs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Amid the prospect of a lawsuit against the state by big tobacco, the Department of Health said: "The threat of legal challenges should not act as deterrents for the introduction of appropriate public health measures."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It added that the plain packaging proposals are "a proportionate and justified public health measure".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The death rate from smoking related illnesses in Ireland is about 9% higher than the European average.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>:: 36% of all smokers were regular smokers using 11-20 cigarettes a day while 59.2% were occasional to light smokers having up to 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Some 4.8% are classed as heavy smokers on 21 or more a day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The HSE report also revealed that one of its Quit campaign ads featuring the late Gerry Collins inspired more than 200,000 attempts by people to give up smoking since last year and have been used as a model for similar campaigns in the UK.</td></tr>
