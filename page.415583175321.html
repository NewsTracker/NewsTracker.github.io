<h3>FIFA Says 2022 World Cup Final in Qatar Will Be on Dec. 18</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE- In this Jan. 3, 2011 file photo, a worker cleans the road outside Khalifa sport complex in Doha, Qatar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 2022 World Cup host nation announced on Thursday, March 19, 2015 that the final World Cup game of the 2022 tournament will be on Dec. 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The final of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be on Dec. 18, the country's national holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>FIFA confirmed on Thursday the date of the world's most watched sports event more than four years after it controversially chose the tiny Gulf emirate as host.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Finally, Qatar got its reward for enduring an investigation into alleged corruption in the bidding process, and a European-led furor over moving the World Cup from its traditional June-July period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In more than seven years, on Dec. 18 - which Qataris recognize as their nation's founding day in 1878 - the yet-to-be-built Lusail Stadium near Doha will stage the World Cup final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's a Sunday, and it's also the national day of Qatar and, yes, in principle, we try to play in 28 days," FIFA spokesman Walter De Gregorio said, confirming a decision of the executive committee in the opening session of its two-day meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A 28-day tournament kicking off on Monday, Nov. 21, would see the 64 matches played in four fewer days than usual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It could be confirmed on Friday, De Gregorio said in a hastily arranged statement at FIFA headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The announcement dominated a day FIFA hoped to dedicate to women's football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>France was awarded the 2019 Women's World Cup hosting rights just as news began to leak of the expected but long-awaited 2022 final date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Qatar was chosen as host in December 2010, bid to stage a June-July tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It pledged to develop stadium cooling technology to overcome intense heat in the Gulf summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>However, FIFA President Sepp Blatter and other top officials started insisting in 2013 that a change to cooler months was needed to protect the health of players, fans, and people working at the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The November-December option was expected after being recommended by a FIFA-appointed task force which met last month in Doha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The task force was launched 18 months ago, though the outcome seemed pre-judged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>European clubs and leagues, who must shut down for several weeks midseason, were the strongest opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Recent debate focused on a date for the final, with Blatter stating he preferred Sunday, Dec. 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Every World Cup final since 1966 has been played on a Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>By rejecting UEFA's preferred Dec. 23 final, a Friday, the FIFA executive committee helped protect the English Premier League's traditional Dec. 26 program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A 28-day World Cup, four days fewer than usual, would cut the time clubs must release players to national teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Earlier Thursday, Blatter announced that France was chosen over South Korea for the 2019 Women's World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The tournament comes back to Europe after Germany served as host in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This year's tournament kicks off in Canada on June 6 with 24 teams for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Japan is the defending champion after winning a 16-team tournament four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>France will choose nine stadiums from 11 candidates, though Lyon will host the opening match and final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>FIFA also chose France to host the Women's Under-20 World Cup in 2018, which will be played in four venues in the Brittany region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>South Korea hoped to give Asia back-to-back hosting of the biggest women's football prizes, ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Obviously from Asia, there will be some level of disappointment," said Asian Football Confederation vice president Moya Dodd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"But women's football is massive in the Olympics and getting bigger, and of course there are opportunities (for hosting) in 2023."</td></tr>
