<h3>Google shares gain a record $65 billion</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google's stock roared out of a long slumber Friday to produce the biggest shareholder windfall in U.S. history as investors rewarded the Internet company for promising to curb its spending on risky projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A 16 percent gain in Google's publicly traded stock translated into an additional $65.1 billion in shareholder wealth, on paper at least.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That barely topped the previous record one-day gain of $65 billion by Cisco Systems Inc. in April 2000, after the computer networking equipment maker had suffered a steep drop in the previous week, according to S&P Dow Jones Indexes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple posted a $46.4 billion one-day gain in April 2012 after its quarterly earnings wowed Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google's gigantic increase came after the Mountain View company reported quarterly earnings that topped analyst estimates for the first time since late 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company's inability to hit the targets that steer investors had raised doubts about Google that had caused its stock to lag the rest of the market since the end of 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Investors were even more impressed with a message of newfound austerity delivered by new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In prepared remarks and in responses to analyst questions posed in a late Thursday conference call, Porat repeatedly stressed that Google intends to control its costs more diligently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Google's market value hit $469 billion, a distant second to Apple's $747 billion.</td></tr>
