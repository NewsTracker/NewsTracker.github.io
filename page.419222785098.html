<h3>Women live-tweet their periods to Donald Trump</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Women are live-tweeting their periods to Donald Trump to prove a point: Periods are not an insult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After the Republican presidential hopeful implied - perhaps inadvertently - that Fox News Host Megyn Kelly was hard on him during Thursday's debate because she was menstruating, women took to Twitter to protest the comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With the hashtag #periodsarenotaninsult, activists began chronicling their periods and mentioning Trump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The fury against Trump started after he slammed Kelly a day after the debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The candidate claimed that she asked him tougher questions while other politicians got off with softballs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever," Trump said on CNN Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hey @realDonaldTrump, I'm getting my period soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But many people believed the candidate was implying that Kelly was on her period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That's when the tweets started pouring in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Hey @realDonaldTrump, I just finished my period, can I ask you a few questions?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Twitter user Tara Dublin asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>@realDonaldTrump I've been bleeding for two days and my brain is STILL working better than yours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"@realDonaldTrump - on the third day of my period AND still a functioning member of society! Who knew?!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Kat Victorious wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"@realDonaldTrump Just finished menstruating. I still don't like you. Guess it had nothing to do w/ my period," Jennifer Welborn added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>@realDonaldTrump On my period atm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Was nauseous and in pain all day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Still did a huge swim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"@realDonaldTrump I'm getting my period this week. I'll make sure to keep you updated," Skylar Thomas wrote, adding red-colored emojis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While Trump defended his remarks against Kelly, he has not specifically commented on the #periodsarenotaninsult campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I will apologize if I'm wrong about something. But I don't like apologizing when I'm not wrong. You know, an apology, to me, is a big deal," Trump said on NBC's "Meet the Press."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The bombastic billionaire also claimed he "will be phenomenal to the women" during a segment on CBS Sunday and added that he "had great relationship with women" during an interview on NBC.</td></tr>
