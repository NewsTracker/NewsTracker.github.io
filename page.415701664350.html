<h3>Tunisia closes airspace to western Libya for security reasons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"We've suspended temporarily again Libya flights for security reasons," the transport ministry official said, without elaborating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The moves come after militants killed 20 foreign tourists in an attack on the national museum in Tunis last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Tunisian officials say the two gunmen had been trained at a jihadist camp in Libya, where Islamic State has made inroads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tunisia is worried violence will spill over from Libya, where two rival governments fight for control four years after the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Libyan airlines had been allowed only since last week to resume flights to Tunis from Tripoli and other airports in western Libya outside the control of the official government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The internationally recognized administration has been based in the east since losing control of Tripoli in August when an armed group seized the capital and parts of western Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Flights from Tunis to eastern Libya have never stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tunisia is the lifeline for many Libyans seeking to escape violence or travel abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Foreign airlines and embassies have mostly withdrawn from Libya for security reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The few foreign connections from Libyan airlines are often booked out for weeks.</td></tr>
