<h3>Another blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh, police say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police have arrested two men over the murder which comes just weeks after an American atheist blogger was also hacked to death in Dhaka, a crime that triggered international outrage, the officer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"He was brutally hacked to death this morning with big knives just 500 yards (460 metres) from his home at Dhaka's Begunbari area," Wahidul Islam, the local police chief, told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Police said they were unsure whether the victim, Washiqur Rahman, 27, was also an atheist blogger but another social media writer said that he was known to write "against religious fundamentalism".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It appeared Rahman used to write using a penname Kutshit Hasher Chhana (Ugly Duckling)," Imran Sarker, head of Blogger and Online Activists Network in Bangladesh, told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He was a progressive free thinker and was against religious fundamentalism," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Police have also arrested a suspect over the killing in February of American atheist writer and blogger Avijit Roy.</td></tr>
