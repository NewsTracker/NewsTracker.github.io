<h3>Hamilton has 2 hits, 2 runs in Rangers' 4-2 win over Angels (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ANAHEIM, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Josh Hamilton stepped to the plate with a rueful smirk while boos cascaded down from the Angel Stadium stands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The slugger looked at Angels catcher Chris Iannetta and grinned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It's just like (when) I was playing here,'' Hamilton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''They booed me when I was here, and they boo me when I'm not here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hamilton didn't mind the abuse when he could help the Texas Rangers to a win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hamilton doubled, singled and scored two runs in his return to the Big A, and Texas got 7-plus outstanding innings of four-hit ball from Colby Lewis in a 4-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hamilton was jeered whenever he stepped to the plate or touched the ball at the stadium where he played the previous two seasons after signing a five-year, $125 million free-agent deal with the Angels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The former AL MVP was traded back to Texas three months ago following two dismal years in Orange County during which he profoundly frustrated Angels fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''The reaction from the crowd was exactly what I expected,'' Hamilton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''Wasn't too bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hamilton had just his second multi-hit game of July despite the frosty reception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He chatted frequently on the field with his former Angels teammates, and he also figured in both of the Rangers' scoring rallies, with his double off the right-field wall starting the Rangers' decisive three-run surge in the fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''I think he handled it fine,'' Texas manager Jeff Banister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''He's probably been booed in other stadiums before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hamilton also chatted extensively on the field with Mike Trout, who hit his 29th home run to pull even with Albert Pujols atop the AL homers race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''Everybody knew he was going to get booed,'' said Trout, who publicly supported Hamilton after the slugger's latest struggle with sobriety led to the trade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''But we've turned the page over here, and he's turned the page since he's been over there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Trout also had a run-scoring single in the eighth for the Angels (54-42).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>They have lost two straight after winning 17 of their previous 20, allowing Houston (55-43) to pull virtually even atop the AL West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Robinson Chirinos drove in two runs for the Rangers, who jumped on Angels fill-in starter Nick Tropeano to win their third straight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Lewis (10-4) shook off his dismal career history against the Angels to dominate their surging lineup, striking out nine while yielding only three infield singles and Trout's solo homer in the fourth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>After retiring 15 of the first 17, Lewis gave up two singles leading off the sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He calmly struck out Kole Calhoun, Trout and Pujols, who have all hit superbly against Lewis in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''I just tried to go from pitch to pitch there, read swings and throw a bunch of sliders,'' said Lewis, who gave up 12 hits and 10 runs to the Angels on July 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tropeano (1-1) pitched seven-hit ball into the seventh inning of his second start for the Angels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He retired 13 straight Rangers before the double by Hamilton, who scored from third after Tropeano's pickoff throw to first got past C.J. Cron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Trout delivered a two-out RBI single off Keone Kela in the eighth, but Pujols took a called third strike moments later with two runners on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Pujols went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Shawn Tolleson pitched the ninth for his 16th save.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Tropeano was optioned back to Triple-A Salt Lake after the game to make room for infielder Conor Gillaspie, acquired from the White Sox earlier in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Gillaspie could get starts at third base while David Freese's broken finger heals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Rangers: C Carlos Corporan (sprained thumb) took batting practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He is expected to be activated next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Angels: RHP Jered Weaver won't return early next month after missing the last month with a hip injury, but shouldn't be out much longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Rangers: Yovani Gallardo (7-9, 2.91 ERA) has lost three straight starts despite his tidy ERA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Angels: Hector Santiago (7-4, 2.30 ERA) began the weekend with the AL's third-best ERA.</td></tr>
