<h3>Reluctant Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras fights to pass reforms in Greek parliament</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hard sell ... Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras pauses ahead of a parliamentary meeting of Syriza party lawmakers in Athens on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Athens: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras fought to contain a backlash from his own leftwing party on Wednesday as parliament prepared to vote on a sweeping austerity package European partners have demanded for a new bailout to keep Greece in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The ruling Syriza party, elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, has been deeply split by the bailout deal that a reluctant Tsipras was forced to accept after gruelling negotiations in Brussels this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>More than half of the party's 201-member central committee, signed a statement rejecting the "humiliating" terms of the bailout, saying it was not compatible with the principles of the left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This proposal cannot be accepted by the people of Syriza," they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tough day at the office ... Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece's finance minister, pauses while attending a parliamentary meeting in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>With pro-European opposition parties set to back the bailout, the measures are expected to pass some time after midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But around 30-40 Syriza lawmakers are likely either to abstain or vote against the government, raising a question mark over how long Tsipras can remain in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who was sacked by Tsipras last week, denounced the bailout as "a new Versailles Treaty" - the agreement that demanded unaffordable reparations from Germany after World War One.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Deputy finance minister Nadia Valavani resigned and Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis said he would not back the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Anti-Euro protesters march through the streets during an anti-austerity rally in Athens, as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras battled to win lawmakers' approval on Wednesday for a bailout deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The choice between a bailout or catastrophe is a choice made in the face of terror," Lafazanis, who heads the far-left flank of Syriza, told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Even ministers supporting it could muster little enthusiasm for an accord which will impose a painful mix of tax hikes, public spending clamps and pension and labour reforms on the already severely weakened economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"It's a difficult deal, a deal for which only time will show if it is economically viable," Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told lawmakers during a debate on reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Members of the Communist-affiliated PAME labor union shout slogans during an anti-austerity rally in Athens, Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A snap election could follow if the prime minister's majority collapses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tsipras is expected to reshuffle his cabinet after the vote, replacing Lafazanis and Deputy Labour Minister Dimitris Stratoulis, another bailout opponent, and possibly making other changes as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A study by the International Monetary Fund issued on Tuesday called for much more debt relief than European countries, particularly Germany, have been prepared to countenance so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Riot police try to avoid petrol bombs during clashes with anti-austerity protesters in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Berlin, which along with the other creditors knew about the IMF study before agreeing to new bailout talks, may wince at providing huge debt relief to a country it scarcely trusts to honour its promises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Germany insists on having the IMF in the negotiations to help keep Greece in line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It may countenance extending maturities for Greek debt but says it will not accept a writedown, with the finance ministry insisting it could not accept "a debt haircut via the backdoor".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>French Prime Minister Manuel Valls delivers his speech about the situation in Greece before a non-binding vote at the National Assembly in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Given the hurdles facing the agreement, doubts have already surfaced about how long it can hold together, with one senior European Union official saying it had a "20-, maybe 30 per cent chance of success".</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>With Greece facing an urgent deadline on July 20, when a 3.5 billion euro payment to the European Central Bank is due, European Union officials were racing to agree a bridge financing accord that would enable Athens to avoid defaulting on the loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There were strong objections from both Britain and the Czech Republic - EU countries that do not use the euro - to proposals to provide a 7 billion euro ($5.19 billion) loan from the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), an EU-wide fund not intended for euro zone funding needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The European Commission published its own assessment of Greece's debt burden on Wednesday that also offered the prospect of debt relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>While also ruling out any write-offs, the Commission said debt reprofiling was possible, as long as Greece implemented the reforms it has committed to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Fighting his own battle with Brussels to reform the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron joined calls to give Greece debt relief but ruled out contributing to the bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Washington has stepped up pressure for a deal between the euro zone and NATO member Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is making a short-notice trip to Frankfurt, Berlin and Paris this week to press for a quick agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>European stocks rose and bond yields fell, with investors betting parliament would back the bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Although the bailout package is much tougher than the Greek people could have imagined when they resoundingly rejected a previous offer from the creditors in a referendum on July 5, most want to keep the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>With banks shut and the threat of a calamitous exit from the currency bloc hovering over the country if it cannot conclude a deal, many Greeks see the package as the lesser of two evils.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"We are Europe's bankrupt child and as a child, Europe has been supporting us for five years and told us what we needed to do to get out of this situation," Yannis Theodosis, a 35-year-old civil engineer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"We did nothing and now we are paying the consequences."</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Civil servants held a strike on Wednesday, as did pharmacists, whose industry would be opened up under the reform package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Left-wing anti-bailout groups staged protest marches, although street protests have been relatively muted so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The latest deal was a major capitulation from Syriza, which stormed to power promising an end to austerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The fiery parliamentary speaker and the party's parliamentary spokesman both announced they would vote against reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Such outbursts had one right-wing newspaper crowing over the "civil war" engulfing the party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Syriza's junior coalition partner said it would vote only for certain clauses in the bill, rejecting those reforms that went beyond a previous vote in parliament that had given Tsipras a mandate to negotiate in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>In recent weeks, negotiations between Athens and its creditors became increasingly fractious, with each side accusing the other of blackmail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Greece painted European countries, particularly Germany, as bullies, while the creditors said their trust in the Greek negotiators had all but evaporated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Iran nuclear deal: has Rouhani's reform moment...</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>'Authoritarian' Greek deal fuels Eurosceptics'...</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Iran nuclear agreement: Republicans vocal about...</td></tr>
