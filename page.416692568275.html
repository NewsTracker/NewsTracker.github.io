<h3>Experts: Convictions will be tough to win in Baltimore case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Baltimore's top prosecutor acted swiftly, charging six officers in the death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a grave spinal injury as he was arrested and put into a police transport van, handcuffed and without a seat belt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But getting a jury to convict police officers of murder and manslaughter will be far harder than obtaining arrest warrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Legal experts say the case is fraught with challenges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The widely shown video that captured the nation's attention shows Gray, 25, being loaded into a police transport van, but not what happened once he was inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Other than the accused officers, the only known witness is a convicted criminal later placed in the van's other holding cell, unable to see what was happening with Gray.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby announced the charges Friday amid the backdrop of a city in turmoil - four days after public anger over Gray's death triggered riots, with heavily armed troops enforcing a nightly curfew, and the day before scheduled protest marches expected to draw thousands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Within hours, the city's police union questioned the prosecutor's impartiality, accusing her of a rush to judgment and demanding she recuse herself from the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Even some of those who support Mosby's stand worry further violence might erupt if she fails to win convictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Alan Dershowitz, a well-known criminal lawyer from New York and professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, suggested that Mosley's actions were motivated more by political expediency and short-term public safety than strong evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He called the charges "outrageous and irresponsible," especially the second degree murder count filed against the van's driver under a legal principle known as "depraved heart."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The decision to file charges was made not based on considerations of justice, but on considerations of crowd control," Dershowitz said Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>To win a conviction, city prosecutors will have to convince a jury that transport van driver Caesar Goodson acted so recklessly that he knew his actions could take Gray's life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The classic example often taught in law schools is that a person who drops a flower pot off the balcony of a skyscraper onto a busy sidewalk below, or someone who fires a gun into a crowded bus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"That's really the sort of shocking charge," said Andrew Alperstein, a Baltimore defense attorney and former prosecutor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Across the nation, it is very rare for law enforcement officers to be charged following fatal encounters with suspects, much less convicted by jurors often predisposed to give extra weight and credibility to the accounts provided by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>By bringing charges less than two weeks after Gray's death, Mosby said her decision showed "no one is above the law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"No matter what your occupation, your age, your race, your color or your creed, it is my job to examine and investigate the evidence of each case and apply those facts to the elements of a crime, in order to make a determination as to whether individuals should be prosecuted," Mosby said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"This is a tremendous responsibility, but ... it is precisely what I did in the case of Freddie Gray."</td></tr>
