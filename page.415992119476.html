<h3>AP source: Indians, Kluber closing in on multiyear contract (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLEVELAND (AP) -- A person familiar with the negotiations says the Cleveland Indians are close to signing AL Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber to a multiyear contract extension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kluber's agent and the club have had talks during the spring and were nearing a deal, the person told The Associated Press on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An agreement could be finalized as early as Sunday, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the Indians do not comment during contract talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kluber, who went 18-9 last season, is scheduled to pitch Monday's season opener at Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The right-hander signed a one-year deal worth $601,000 last month as talks initially failed to produce a long-term deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kluber will turn 29 on April 10, and general manager Chris Antonetti made it clear during spring training that the club was interested in investing in him for the future.</td></tr>
