<h3>Frankie Ballard's 'Young and Crazy' Precedes 'Risky' New Album</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He'd been riding high on back-to-back Number Ones in "Helluva Life" and "Sunshine & Whiskey," and wanted to release something that reflected his "live now" worldview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ballard settled on the uptempo rocker "Young and Crazy," which he describes as a "call to action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I see so many people living in a bubble. They want to be safe, they want their kids to be safe and they want their friends to be safe. And I get that. That's awesome and really admirable," Ballard tells Rolling Stone Country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"But life is not about who gets out the cleanest at the end, or who's the most well-preserved and healthiest. I refuse to believe that is what life is about - life is about living."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The lyrics of "Young and Crazy," written by Rhett Akins, Ashley Gorley and Shane McAnally, speak to that belief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With lines like "I want to sit out on the porch telling stories of my glory days when I'm pushing 80," the song doesn't look back in nostalgia, but anticipates a well-seasoned future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The best times I've ever had and the greatest lessons I've ever learned were when my feet were out over the edge of the line and I was at risk of getting a little beat up, physically and emotionally," Ballard says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>For the video, directed by Glen Rose, Ballard put his live show into focus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While previous videos featured the guitarist performing, none were authentic concert experiences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With "Young and Crazy," Ballard, who is currently on the road with Florida Georgia Line, was filmed onstage over three nights in his native Midwest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"There were performance pieces in the other videos, but not real performance pieces. They weren't plugged in. But this is us actually playing those songs, so those emotions are real," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Like the song itself, he hopes the clip serves as inspiration for people to leave the house and experience the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Or at least one of his concerts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ballard is practicing what he's preaching too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For his next album, he reveals that he'll be leaving the comfortable - some might say safe -confines of Nashville's studios for a facility farther south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>For 10 days, he and his band will hole up in an undisclosed studio to write and record the way his heroes did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We're going off-campus. This follow-up to Sunshine & Whiskey is very important to my career, so at a time like this to do something weird is risky," admits Ballard, turning suddenly animated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"But it makes me feel alive, man! We're going to go in with nothing and we're going to come out with an album. And that's the way all my favorite albums were made. You slept at the studio - we're going to do that. If we feel like putting down some guitars at two in the morning, we will."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Through the prism of "Young and Crazy," Ballard's roll-the-dice approach to recording makes perfect sense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It's keeping in line with that carpe diem attitude.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>A 32-year-old officer from nearby Webster Groves was shot in the face and a 41-year-old officer from St. Louis County was shot in the shoulder, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>Earlier in the day, the resignation of Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson was announced in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report prompted by the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I don't know who did the shooting, to be honest with you," Belmar said, adding that he could not provide a description of the suspect or gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He said he assumed, based on where the officers were standing and the trajectory of the bullets, that "these shots were directed exactly at my officers."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The shots were fired shortly after midnight as protesters gathered following the resignation of embattled Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Before the shooting, some at the protest chanted to show their dissatisfaction with the resignations of Jackson and City Manager John Shaw this week, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Authorities from multiple law enforcement agencies also assembled at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The protest was a familiar scene in Ferguson, which saw similar and much larger demonstrations after the shooting death of black 18-year-old Michael Brown last summer by city police officer Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A state grand jury cleared Wilson, who is white, in November, sparking further protests, looting and fires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Wednesday was the first time an officer at a protest had been shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In amateur video accessed by the Associated Press, two shots ring out and a man is heard screaming out in pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Someone at the scene, unseen and unidentified in the video, says: "Acknowledgement nine months ago would have kept that from happening."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Marciay Pitchford, 20, was among the protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>She told the AP that the protest had been mostly peaceful until she heard the shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I saw the officer go down and the other police officers drew their guns while other officers dragged the injured officer away," Pitchford said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"All of a sudden everybody started running or dropping to the ground."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Belmar said the shots were fired from across the street from the police department.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>A police officer walks toward the Ferguson Police Department Thursday, March 12, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>Jackson was the sixth employee to resign or be fired after a Justice Department report last week cleared Wilson of civil rights charges in the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Wilson has also resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A separate Justice Department report released the same day found a profit-driven court system and widespread racial bias in the city police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mayor James Knowles III announced Wednesday that the city had reached a mutual separation agreement with Jackson that will pay him one year of his nearly $96,000 annual salary and health coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Jackson's resignation becomes effective March 19, at which point Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Al Eickhoff will become acting chief while the city searches for a replacement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Jackson had resisted calls by protesters and some of Missouri's top elected leaders to step down over his handling of Brown's shooting and the weeks of protests that followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He was widely criticized from the outset for the aggressive police response to protests and his agency's erratic and infrequent releases of key information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He took nearly a week to publicly identify Wilson as the shooter and then further heightened tension in the community by releasing Wilson's name at the same time as store security video that police said showed Brown stealing a box of cigars and shoving a clerk a short time before his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>During a 12-minute news conference, Knowles said Jackson resigned after "a lot of soul-searching" about how the community could heal from the racial unrest stemming from the fatal shooting last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"The chief is the kind of honorable man you don't have to go to," Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"He comes to you when he knows that this is something we have to seriously discuss."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division released a statement saying the U.S. government remains committed to reaching a "court-enforceable agreement" to address Ferguson's "unconstitutional practices," regardless of who's in charge of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Jackson oversaw the Ferguson force for nearly five years before the shooting that stirred months of unrest across the St. Louis region and drew global attention to the predominantly black city of 21,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>In addition to Jackson, Ferguson's court clerk was fired last week and two police officers resigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>The judge who oversaw the court system also resigned, and the City Council on Tuesday agreed to a separation agreement with Shaw, the city manager.</td></tr>
