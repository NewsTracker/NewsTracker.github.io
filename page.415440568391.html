<h3>Israel election: Netanyahu shifts tactics as Likud appears to slip</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jerusalem: When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made an unannounced visit this week to the Mahane Yehuda market here, he did not invite the local news media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Instead, selected scenes from his tour were filmed and the video released by his campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The curious decision to not invite the press stemmed from security concerns, campaign aides said, but Israeli security officials told reporters they had not made the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Israeli political commentators concluded that even in this traditional stronghold of support for his conservative Likud party, Mr Netanyahu was worried about being heckled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>By Friday, with just days to go before the national elections, the reasons for Mr Netanyahu's concern were apparent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Most of the last polls to be published before the vote showed Likud trailing its main rival, the Zionist Union, a centre-left slate headed by the Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog and his running mate, Tzipi Livni, the leader of a small centrist party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Labour Party leader Isaac Herzog and running mate Tzipi Livni in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Herzog and Ms Livni have agreed to split the four-year term as prime minister if they win, with Mr Herzog serving in the post for the first two years and Ms Livni for the second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Netanyahu, who is running for his third consecutive term, and fourth overall, is beginning to confront the very real possibility of a political about-face in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"If we do not close the gap in the next few days there is indeed a danger that Tzipi Livni and Bougie Herzog will be the next prime ministers," Mr Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 2 News, referring to Mr Herzog by his nickname.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Political analysts say that the widening gap in the polls could work two ways, infusing the Zionist Union campaign with more momentum or creating a degree of complacency on the left while spurring disenchanted Likud supporters to renew their support for Mr Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In addition, under Israel's multiparty system, the winner of the election is not necessarily the leader of the largest party but the party leader who has the best chance of forming a governing coalition that will command at least 61 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Mr Netanyahu is generally considered to have more of what he calls "natural partners" for a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Herzog would have to get some small and medium-size parties that are hostile to each other to agree to sit together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He insists that, given a chance, his talent for team-building will prove itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Either way, the public dynamic seems to have been shifting against Mr Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In polls published in Friday's editions of the Yediot Aharonot and Maariv newspapers, the Zionist Union was projected to win by four seats in the Knesset over Likud (26-22 in Yediot, and 25-21 in Maariv).</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Maariv poll found that 72 per cent of Israelis believe that Israel is in need of a change of direction, regardless of who would be the next prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A poll by Israel Radio released Friday also showed the Zionist Union leading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Herzog has emerged as an increasingly credible candidate for the post of prime minister in recent weeks, largely capitalising on Mr Netanyahu's failures to address the daily concerns of millions of Israelis over the high cost of living and a lack of reasonably priced housing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Netanyahu has focused on his credentials as a strong leader best able to protect Israelis against the potential nuclear threat of Iran and other enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But even on the security front Mr Netanyahu has found himself challenged, with his critics accusing him of fraying Israel's ties with its most crucially, the United States, over the Iranian issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"You and you alone turned the United States from an ally into an enemy," Shabtai Shavit, a former chief of the Mossad spy agency, said in a blistering statement addressed to Mr Netanyahu at a news conference with several other former security chiefs and retired commanders in Tel Aviv this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Another retired Mossad chief, Meir Dagan, has also come out of the shadows on a mission to unseat Mr Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>At an opposition rally attended by tens of thousands of people in Tel Aviv last Saturday night, Mr Dagan, who is known to be unwell, captivated the audience by delivering a keynote speech with tears in his eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Israel is surrounded by enemies," he told the crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Enemies do not scare me; I worry about our leadership."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He said what he most feared was "a lack of vision, a lack of direction and determination, and a dearth of exemplary leadership."</td></tr>
