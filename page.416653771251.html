<h3>Snowden injury-free and returning to form</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kade Snowden says his 2015 NRL form revival can be put down to being injury-free for the first time in four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Newcastle prop Kade Snowden says he's injury-free for the first time in four years and happy to be back in the representative frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When Snowden runs out for NSW Country against City in Wagga Wagga on Sunday, it will be a case of returning to square one for the 28-year-old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was last sighted in the representative ranks in 2011 after breaking into the Australian and NSW side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the time it appeared a bright future was at his feet but he fell away sharply after a move to Newcastle from Cronulla in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But he has opened the 2015 NRL season strongly with the Knights, which he puts down to shaking a troublesome back injury which has hindered him since his breakout 2011 season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's all based on having injuries coming into the year. And this year I haven't had any," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I had a good pre-season and it's showing in my football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I've got two bulging discs in my back and on my neck and it's what's held me back the last couple of years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Since 2011 he has had to constantly manage his back and neck issues which have hampered his recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Over time his ailments have eased and he says it is showing in his football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's been the main part, having no injuries, you have no doubt in the back of your mind," he says when asked about the reasons for his form reversal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"You can go harder and go for longer and that's all to do with the pre-season I've had."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Snowden is now back where it all began - with NSW Country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He says his berth in the side in 2010 was a springboard to bigger and better things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He knows he has slid down the the NSW front row pecking order but is just happy to be considered for representative honours.</td></tr>
