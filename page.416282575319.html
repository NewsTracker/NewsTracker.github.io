<h3>Secrecy Shrouds Decade-Old Oil Spill in Gulf of Mexico</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This March 31, 2015 photo shows an oil sheen drifting from the site of the former Taylor Energy oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Louisiana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Associated Press investigation has revealed evidence that the spill is far worse than what the Taylor Energy Company _ or the government _ has publicly reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Presented with AP's findings, the Coast Guard provided a new leak estimate that is about 20 times greater than one recently touted by the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A blanket of fog lifts, exposing a band of rainbow sheen that stretches for miles off the coast of Louisiana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>From the vantage point of an airplane, it's easy to see gas bubbles in the slick that mark the spot where an oil platform toppled during a 2004 hurricane, triggering what might be the longest-running commercial oil spill ever to pollute the Gulf of Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yet more than a decade after crude started leaking at the site formerly operated by Taylor Energy Company, few people even know of its existence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company has downplayed the leak's extent and environmental impact, likening it to scores of minor spills and natural seeps the Gulf routinely absorbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>An Associated Press investigation has revealed evidence that the spill is far worse than what Taylor - or the government - have publicly reported during their secretive, and costly, effort to halt the leak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Presented with AP's findings, that the sheen recently averaged about 91 gallons of oil per day across eight square miles, the Coast Guard provided a new leak estimate that is about 20 times greater than one recently touted by the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Outside experts say the spill could be even worse - possibly one of the largest ever in the Gulf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Taylor's oil was befouling the Gulf for years in obscurity before BP's massive spill in mile-deep water outraged the nation in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even industry experts haven't heard of Taylor's slow-motion spill, which has been leaking like a steady trickle from a faucet, compared to the fire hose that was BP's gusher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Taylor, a company renowned in Louisiana for the philanthropy of its deceased founder, has kept documents secret that would shed light on what it has done to stop the leak and eliminate the persistent sheen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Coast Guard said in 2008 the leak posed a "significant threat" to the environment, though there is no evidence oil from the site has reached shore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ian MacDonald, a Florida State University biological oceanography professor and expert witness in a lawsuit against Taylor, said the sheen "presents a substantial threat to the environment" and is capable of harming birds, fish and other marine life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Using satellite images and pollution reports, the watchdog group SkyTruth estimates between 300,000 and 1.4 million gallons of oil has spilled from the site since 2004, with an annual average daily leak rate between 37 and 900 gallons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If SkyTruth's high-end estimate of 1.4 million gallons is accurate, Taylor's spill would be about 1 percent the size of BP's, which a judge ruled amounted to 134 million gallons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That would still make the Taylor spill the 8th largest in the Gulf since 1970, according to a list compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The Taylor leak is just a great example of what I call a dirty little secret in plain sight," said SkyTruth President John Amos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Taylor has spent tens of millions of dollars to contain and stop its leak, but it says nothing can be done to completely halt the chronic slicks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The New Orleans based company presented federal regulators last year with a proposed "final resolution" at the site, but the details remain under wraps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>For years, the government has allowed the company to shield other spill-related information from public scrutiny - all in the name of protecting trade secrets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Industry experts and environmental advocates are baffled by Taylor's inability to stop the leak and its demands for confidentiality.</td></tr>
