<h3>New Apple patent may soon let you unlock your iPhone with a selfie</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This image from Apple's freshly-approved USPTO application for 'locking and unlocking a mobile device using facial recognition' demonstrates how the technology could be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(United States Patent and Trademark Office / Apple Inc.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Unlocking your iPhone could soon be as easy as taking a selfie-easier, even, if you factor out all of the filtering and Facetuning a lot of these photos require before actually going online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple Inc. has been granted an official patent on a technology that uses facial recognition to unlock mobile phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Published by The U.S. Patent and Trade Office Tuesday, the patent document shows that Apple has been developing this iPhone feature since at least 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In an embodiment of the invention, an unlocked mobile device is configured to capture images, analyze the images to detect a user's face, and automatically lock the device in response to determining that a user's face does not appear in the images," reads the patent application.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The file goes on to describe the way this technology works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Essentially, a user would bring the phone up to his or her face, at which point a sensor would trigger a processor to capture an image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That image would then be analyzed against an image of the user's face that was presumably taken when he or she set the feature up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If the faces in both photos match, the phone would automatically unlock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple also notes that this technology could be used to identify additional authorized users, much like the biometric fingerprint scanner it unveiled in 2013 with the iPhone 5S.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>As Recode's Dawn Chmielewski points out, Apple is not the first mobile phone producer to show interest in facial recognition technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Most contemporary Android phones already have a feature that automatically unlocks a phone upon recognizing an owner's face, though "Google warns this is less secure than, say, a password, since someone who looks like you also could unlock the phone," Chmielewski writes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Apple's technology would also improve upon the existing Android feature in that users wouldn't have to activate their screens by pressing any buttons-instead, Apple tracks the phone's movements to see if a user is holding it up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>You can read the full, freshly-approved patent for "locking and unlocking a mobile device using facial recognition" right here.</td></tr>
