<h3>WWE good guy John Cena goes edgy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>And Dwayne Johnson, who perfected his personality as "The Rock" as a WWE champion, is one of movies' biggest box-office draws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A recent visitor to the town of Bedrock, John Cena is wrestling's top superstar, a fan favorite for crowds of kids and also WWE's most popular good guy - or "babyface" in the in-ring parlance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He has quite a few movies to his credit himself, though if we're being honest The Marine, 12 Rounds and the occasional episode of E!</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>network's Total Divas isn't quite the same as the Fast & Furious franchise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Since he's an action hero every week on USA Network's Monday Night Raw, Cena told us how unproductive it is for him to do those kind of on-screen roles in films, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Which is why his high-profile parts in two upcoming projects are the opposite of his current wrestling persona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In Judd Apatow's Trainwreck (in theaters July 17), Cena is Amy Schumer's scene-stealing "confused boyfriend/ex-boyfriend" Steven, who in the movie is mockingly called "Mark Wahlberg" by another guy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>(His response: "Mark Wahlberg's like 150 pounds. I look like Mark Wahlberg ate Mark Wahlberg!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I'm trying to get my fix of the adult, non-PG racy stuff with the movie parts that I choose. I had to take a break from movies for a while to redefine where I wanted to go, but now I get my aspirational fill from being a part of the WWE family, and I can pick and choose these small, really fun movie roles where I still get to be an adult."</td></tr>

<h3>Kurds report more chlorine attacks by Islamic State as Iraq pauses Tikrit offensive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>General Aziz Waisi told journalists the insurgents used chlorine twice during a January offensive west of Mosul and once in a December attack on his military police brigade in the Sinjar mountain area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One attack near Mosul, on January 23, was described by Kurdish authorities on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Dutch-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said over the weekend it had not had a request from Iraq to investigate claims of chemical weapons use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Iraq's Kurds were the victims of the deadliest chemical attack of modern times when Saddam Hussein's air force bombed the town of Halabja in 1988, killing at least 5,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In Tikrit, military officials said there was no fighting on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) insurgents controlling large parts of north and west Iraq and territory in neighbouring Syria have held onto central districts of Saddam's home city and have laid explosives to hold up the advancing forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The offensive by Iraqi security forces and mainly Shia militia, who entered Tikrit last week, is their largest yet against Isil, but it stalled on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Government forces control of most of the northern Qadisiya district as well as the southern and western outskirts of the city, trapping the militants in an area bounded by a river along Tikrit's eastern edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We need air support from any force that can work with us against Isil," Ibrahim al-Lami, deputy defence minister, told Reuters, declining to say whether he meant from the US-led coalition or Iran, which is playing a role in the assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Pentagon said it did not view the offensive in Tikrit as stalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Offensive operations like this have a rhythm to them," said Army Colonel Steve Warren, Pentagon spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gen Warren said the US-led coalition helping Iraq had not conducted any strikes in support of operations in Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Powerful militia commander Hadi al-Amiri, head of the Shia paramilitary Badr Organisation, said earlier in the offensive that militia victories before the Tikrit battle had been won without coalition air support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mohammed al-Ghaban, interior minister, said authorities had temporarily halted the offensive in Tikrit "to reduce casualties among our heroic forces... and to preserve the remaining infrastructure".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We will choose the appropriate time to attack the enemy and liberate the area," he told journalists in Samarra, 60 miles north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>More than 20,000 troops and Iranian-backed Shia militia are taking part in the operation, which began two weeks ago, supported by a relatively small contingent of Sunni fighters from Tikrit and the surrounding Salahuddin province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The assault is seen as a litmus test for plans to retake the large northern city of Mosul, which is likely to be a far more complex operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile, coalition air strikes helped Kurdish forces seize Wahda, Saada, and Khalid villages from Isil in the north and drive militants away from the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Shia Turkmen fighters also clashed for a fourth day with Islamic State insurgents near Bashir village, south of Kirkuk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In Baghdad, US presidential envoy General John Allen addressed a meeting of Iraqi and foreign officials aimed at kicking off efforts to stabilise and rebuild territories retaken from Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The militants have been driven back by Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the north and Shia militia known as Hashid Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) in the eastern province of Diyala, the Baghdad belt and north of the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Allen said Iraqis were beginning to recover from life under Islamic State in Diyala and "hopefully soon" in Tikrit, local governance would prove difficult because many officials had been killed, were in exile or co-operated with Isil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rafid al-Jaboori, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's spokesman, echoed calls for more air strikes: "We have been saying we need more air support for all operations," he told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We welcome air support for all our campaigns against Isil".</td></tr>
