<h3>Liberia to end Ebola curfew, open land border crossings</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) - Liberia's president on Friday ordered officials to lift an overnight curfew put in place six months ago to fight the Ebola epidemic and to reopen the country's land border crossings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new orders from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, which take effect Sunday, offer another sign that normal life is resuming in the West African nation as officials work toward eradicating the disease entirely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Once the center of the worst Ebola outbreak in history, Liberia has recorded more than 9,000 confirmed, suspected and probable cases and 3,900 deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, the most recent update from the World Health Organization reported only two cases in the previous week, and schools began reopening earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Friday's statement said Sirleaf made her decision about the curfew and borders "on the advice of the National Security Council of Liberia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The curfew was imposed last August when the epidemic was raging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It originally lasted from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., though officials later pushed the start time back to midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The statement said Sirleaf had ordered that "the country's main borders" be opened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That includes the borders with Sierra Leone and Guinea, but it wasn't immediately clear if the border with Ivory Coast would be reopened, because Ivory Coast closed its borders in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sierra Leone recorded 74 new cases in the latest WHO update and transmission remains widespread there, while Guinea recorded 52 cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sirleaf's announcement comes as she prepares to visit the White House next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a statement, the White House said President Barack Obama and Sirleaf would discuss the current Ebola response and the region's economic recovery plans during their Feb. 27 meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The United States is preparing to withdraw most of the nearly 3,000 troops dispatched to West Africa last year to help combat the outbreak.</td></tr>

<h3>FBI digital search-warrant plan a 'monumental' constitutional threat, says Google</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Richard Salgado, Google's director for law enforcement and information security, wrote Tuesday that the Justice Department's plans for remotely accessing computer files "raises a number of monumental and highly complex constitutional, legal, and geopolitical concerns that should be left to Congress to decide."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>National Journal reported Wednesday that the federal government wants to make changes to a criminal procedure provision known as Rule 41, which would allow judges to approve warrants outside their jurisdictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The serious and complex constitutional concerns implicated by the proposed amendment are numerous and, because of the nature of Fourth Amendment case law development, are unlikely to be addressed by courts in a timely fashion," Mr. Salgado wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Google fears the federal government is using vague language that would permit it to spy on millions of Americans simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Justice Department called the company's fears a "misreading the text of the proposal or misunderstanding current law," the magazine reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The proposal would not authorize the government to undertake any search or seizure or use any remote search technique not already permitted under current law," Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Bitkower said in a memorandum written in 2014 but made public this week, National Journal reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A decision on Rule 41 is expected to be made within months after a review by the Supreme Court and Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Absent any legislation passed to "reject, modify, or defer the rules," the plan would then go into effect, the Journal reported.</td></tr>
