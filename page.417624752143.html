<h3>Apple?s Watch Gets Native Apps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple CEO Tim Cook talks about the Apple Watch operating system at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Apple watch has only been out for about six weeks, and you can't yet buy one at an Apple store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But Apple's first wearable is already getting what Apple says will be a major software update.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kevin Lynch, who is overseeing Apple watch software, announced WatchOS 2, which will let apps natively on the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This means that apps will be able to run on the watch itself, rather than the bulk of the computing happening on the iPhone to which the watch is paired, and then beamed over via Bluetooth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This should result in apps running faster on the watch, addressing a major complaint of those wearing the device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But it could also eat into battery life if the new native apps that come hog the watch's processing power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Lynch, speaking during Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference keynote this morning, also introduced a few new watch faces that can show images from a user's iCloud photo library, as well as time-lapsed images that users have snapped themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>WatchOS 2 will also let developers build their own "complications," which are small digital elements that can be placed on watch faces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Among the complications available now are timers and stopwatches, calendar appointments, the weather, battery life and health information from the Apple Watch's Fitness app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Complications that are tied to time, such as calendar appointments, will get an upgrade too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A new feature called TimeTravel that will let users turn the watch's digital crown to scroll through calendar appointments or notifications from the past, and that are upcoming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Developers can tap into WatchOS 2 today, and it'll roll out to all other watches, for free, this fall.</td></tr>
