<h3>'That's my son!': Jihadi John's mother screams watching Islamic State video</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The mother of Mohammed Emwazi knew he was Jihadi John and screamed "that's my son" when he first appeared in an Islamic State video - but it is believed she failed to tip off the authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ghania Emwazi recognised her son's voice as the masked, knife-wielding killer in the video showing the beheading of American James Foley last August - the first Western hostage to be murdered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>American journalist James Foley was beheaded by Islamic State militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mrs Emwazi screamed at the television when she saw the hooded figure ranting before appearing to murder Mr Foley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After watching the video a second time, Emwazi's father Jassem was also sure it was his son, Kuwaiti investigators disclosed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>There is no evidence the parents went to the police or security services to alert them and it was not until September that officials began to suspect he was the world's most wanted man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police officers near the home of Islamic State militant Mohammed Emwazi, popularly known as Jihadi John.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His identity was made public last week although he has still not been officially confirmed as the man responsible for the murder of at least five Western hostages, including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Emwazi family are in hiding in Kuwait, after returning there from the UK, and have been questioned by the security services there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It is believed the parents came to the UK in the 90s as asylum seekers because they were accused of being supporters of Saddam Hussein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Emwazi was questioned along with one of his sons for most of the day on Sunday after being summoned by police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Unmasked: Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The mother recognised the voice and she screamed 'that is my son' while he was talking before beheading the first American hostage," a source familiar with the Kuwaiti investigation said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"When they played the video again, the father was sure it was his son."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Insiders described Mr Emwazi as "emotional and upset at what had happened to his son" while talking to investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I am waiting day-by-day to hear about his death," he is said to have told his interrogators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Emwazi - who now lives in al-Oyoun, a neighbourhood near Taima, about 20 miles outside Kuwait City - said he last had contact with his son in 2013, shortly before he travelled to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The murderer is said to have told his parents that he planned to move to Syria to "deliver aid".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The father, who holds British citizenship like his son, is understood to be employed by a Co-op supermarket in Kuwait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But workers there said he only showed up every six months in order to renew his Kuwaiti residence permit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Most members of the family are believed to have moved back to Kuwait, where police kept them under close surveillance following the recent revelations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Emwazi snr is said to have been a Kuwaiti police officer himself, having served from 1980 until 1993.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He has been reported by some sources to have left Kuwait after collaborating with Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces after they invaded Kuwait in 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He gained British citizenship in 2002 and moved back to Kuwait the following year, according to sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The family belongs to a group known as Bedoons ("without" in Arabic), who do not have full Kuwaiti citizenship and lack full educational and employment rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Many live in impoverished sprawling neighbourhoods in Taima in ramshackle houses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That setting contrasted sharply with the upmarket neighbourhood of al-Samiya in Kuwait City where Mohammed Emwazi worked as a trainee IT salesman for three months in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Office space rents for up to AU$12,800 per square metre in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Emwazi was said to be a model employee during his probation period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He would have landed a permanent job if he had not failed to return from a trip to London in April 2010.</td></tr>

<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Meanwhile, Google and Facebook are working on giving people more ways to use those devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Samsung Electronics Co. announced the Galaxy S6 phones, with an improved camera and a more stylish design that ditches plastic for metal and glass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus came out last fall, Apple eliminated a big reason for buying Samsung phones: The new iPhones were bigger and closely matched Samsung's flagship Galaxy phones in size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Now, Samsung is trying to catch up to Apple's camera and design.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Samsung's new premium model, the Galaxy S6 Edge, has curved displays for viewing information from the side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Both S6 phones will have mobile-payment capabilities, as Samsung prepares for a summer launch of its rival to Apple Pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>HTC Corp. also announced an update to its HTC One phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Known as M9, the new model will have a better camera, while keeping a metal design and polished finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Previous HTC One phones took 4 megapixel images, as HTC focused instead on the camera's low-light capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But many shots in normal light ended up looking dull.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The phone's main camera will now be 20 megapixels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prices for the HTC One and the main S6 phone will likely be in the $600 to $700 range - on par with the iPhone 6 - when they go on sale in the U.S. and other markets this spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The S6 Edge will cost more, likely by at least $100.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wireless carriers will likely offer steep discounts with two-year service contracts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Lenovo Group's $349 Vibe Shot includes several camera technologies found in higher-priced phones, including a 16-megapixel rear camera and an optical image stabilizer to compensate for shake in low-light conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sony Corp. has the Xperia M4 Aqua with the company's signature waterproof protection for about 299 euros ($336).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Neither phone will make it to the U.S., though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ahead of the show, LG Electronics Inc. announced four mid-range smartphones - Magna, Spirit, Leon and Joy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Prices and U.S. availability weren't revealed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Microsoft Corp. unveiled the Lumia 640 and 640 XL smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The XL is larger and has a sharper camera - at 13 megapixels instead of 8 megapixels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Prices start at 139 euros ($156) before taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>U.S. prices and dates haven't been announced, though AT&T says it will have the larger model exclusively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Microsoft says the phones will get Windows 10 when that system is released later this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Meanwhile, Lenovo's $169 A7000 will include Dolby Atmos audio technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Instead of just stereo, sound will seem three-dimensional when using headphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Dolby says Atmos content isn't available on any streaming or download service just yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The A7000 joins two just-announced Lenovo tablets and last fall's Fire HDX 8.9 tablet from Amazon in having Atmos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It's not destined for U.S. markets, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Last week, Lenovo subsidiary Motorola announced an update to its Moto E. Among the improvements: Better focusing in the rear camera, and a new, front-facing camera for selfies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The U.S. price starts at $120.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Once you have these devices, what do you do with them?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Internet.org, Facebook's effort to create new users in countries with little or low Internet use, has now released apps in six countries - Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Colombia and India - offering health, employment and other information services without incurring data charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Apps are customized for each country, and Internet.org is working with individual wireless operators to lure new users without hurting the local telecoms' businesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>For that reason, the app doesn't include the competing WhatsApp messaging service, which Facebook owns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Sundar Pichai, a vice president at Google, disclosed plans to start testing solar-powered drone aircraft as "floating cell towers" that could bring coverage to remote areas or even disaster zones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Google previously announced Project Loon to use high-altitude air balloons to provide coverage for rural areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Pichai said Project Loon should be ready in about two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>In the U.S., Pichai said Google will develop its own cellular service as "a project" to improve ways for hardware, software and connectivity to work together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He said Google is also working on Android Pay, a mobile-payment system for all Android devices (not just Samsung's Android phones, as Samsung Pay will be limited to).</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Google recently bought technology to improve the Google Wallet payment service it already has.</td></tr>
