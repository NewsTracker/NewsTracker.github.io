<h3>Analyzing Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign: 'It's not about me, it's about you'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>If Hillary Rodham Clinton gets her way, there will be stark differences between her failed 2008 run for president and the White House campaign she embarked upon Sunday -- and not just the end result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This time, her aides have said for days, the focus will be on the American people, not on Clinton; on their needs and concerns and not her reach for history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton jumped back into presidential politics on Sunday, making a much-awaited announcement she will again seek the White House with a promise to serve as the "champion" of everyday Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The shift was abundantly clear in the contrast between her 2007 announcement video and the one she aired Sunday as she jumped into the race -- each just over two minutes in length.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Last time: Clinton sitting in a sumptuously appointed living room, alone as she faces the camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This time: She doesn't even appear in her own video until a minute and a half in, after cameos by more than a dozen people representing a demographic cross section of America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Even then the view is the back of her head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Last time: Thirty-one uses of the word "I," twice the use of the word "we."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This time: Only five uses of the word "I" as Clinton moves to make her campaign a communal effort, and one that focuses strongly on the economic unease that has persisted during the two terms of the man who defeated her in 2008, President Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>If Clinton's effort this time is meant to do anything, it is to undo the destructive sense last time--particularly early on--that hers was the entitled, imperial candidacy, that she was owed the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The new subtext is set by the last person to speak before Clinton herself, a man talking about his pride about recently joining a fifth-generation family business: "This country was founded on hard work."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton then enters for 43 seconds of remarks -- some made over video of her talking to people -- and closing with her talking from a sidewalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It could be the sidewalk in front of the well-appointed home in which she sat in 2007, of course, but it reads visually as if she's part of the neighborhood, not alone inside a mansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I'm getting ready to do something too -- I'm running for president," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Then an immediate segue to the campaign's economic underpinnings, in rhetoric more associated with Democrats such as fist-shaking populist Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, than Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top," she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I wanna be that champion, so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead and stay ahead because when families are strong America is strong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Then her closing message, subtly stated: No entitlement here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"So," she says, "I'm hitting the road to earn your vote. Because it's your time and I hope you'll join me on this journey."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Part of Clinton's challenge, of course, will be blunting Republican assertions that the entire Obama presidency -- to which she is inextricably linked, as his first secretary of State -- has been a failure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The video -- let's face it, Clinton's first campaign ad -- offers a reproach of that argument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Everyone in it is forging ahead, glimmering with optimism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>There are people planting gardens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>People packing and moving for their family's betterment, not because they lost their home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A couple expecting a child, the greatest exemplar of optimism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A gay couple planning their marriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>People renovating homes, starting new careers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It was not hard to grasp from it another Clinton theme: America, under Obama, moved from economic collapse to a frail recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>And I'll get you the rest of the way home.</td></tr>
