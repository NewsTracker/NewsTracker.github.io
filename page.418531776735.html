<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Louis Tomlinson of One Direction is going to be a father.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apparently so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 23-year-old singer and Los Angeles-based stylist Briana Jungwirth are expecting, with a source telling People, "Louis is happy and very excited about becoming a dad and he thinks Briana will be an amazing mother. It was a surprise at first, but he and Briana are very, very close friends and this has brought them even closer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The duo met earlier this year through mutual friends, after Tomlinson broke up with longtime girlfriend Eleanor Calder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The pair may not even be an official couple, though People says Tomlinson wants to be a "hands on" father and plans to be involved in the pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Louis and Briana care about each other very much and have spent a lot of time together privately over the last few months," an insider reportedly to E! Online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They better care about each other -- they're going to be seeing each other for about 18 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Although they aren't in a relationship, their friendship is extremely strong and they are both really excited about the baby. It's early days and Briana and the baby's health are the most important things right now," said the source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The two have been seen holding hands around L.A. in recent months, but it was described as "hanging out."</td></tr>
