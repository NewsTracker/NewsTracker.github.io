<h3>At Least 8 Dead in Tunisia Museum Attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Men with assault rifles fired at tourists climbing from buses in front of the National Bardo Museum in central Tunis near the country's parliament, sending dozens sprinting for safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two gunmen were killed, but Prime Minister Habib Essid said a manhunt was on for at two or three others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Security forces immediately flooded the area, and Tunisia's parliament building, where deputies were debating the new anti-terrorism law, was evacuated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dozens of tourists scrambled from the museum holding hands or linking arms as security forces pointed their guns toward an adjacent building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many elderly people, apparently tourists, ran in panic to safety, including at least one couple carrying two children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tunisia has been struggling to keep extremist violence at bay since the overthrow of its dictator in 2011, and the attack was the worst on a tourist site since an al-Qaida car bomb killed 21 people - mostly Germans - in 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Our nation is in danger," Essid warned in an address on national television Wednesday evening after the siege ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We will be merciless in the defense of our country," he added, describing the attack as an unprecedented assault on Tunisia's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He promised increased security in tourist zones and asked residents to be extra alert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to Essid, the dead include two gunmen, a Tunisian security officer and a Tunisian cleaning woman, while the rest were tourists from Italy, Poland, Germany and Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Spanish Foreign Ministry has confirmed one dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Several other people were reported wounded in the attack, including three Poles and at least two Italians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Italian Foreign Ministry said 100 other Italians had been taken to a secure location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some of the Italians at the museum were believed to have been passengers aboard the Costa Fascinosa, a cruise liner that had docked in Tunis while on a seven-day tour of the western Mediterranean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ship owner Costa Crociere confirmed that some of its 3,161 passengers were visiting the capital and that a Bardo tour was on the itinerary, but said it couldn't confirm how many passengers were in the museum at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The attack was a strong blow to Tunisia's efforts to revive its crucial tourism industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Bardo, built in a 15th century palace, is the largest museum in Tunisia and houses one of the world's largest collections of Roman mosaics among its 8,000 works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The museum, 4 kilometers (2 &frac12; miles) from the city center, has a new wing with contemporary architecture that was built as part of a 2009 renovation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>During the Roman Empire, Tunisia was called the province of Africa and was home to several large cities which are now popular ruins, including the great amphitheater of El Djem, the ruins of Sbeitla and in the north, Dougga, known by UNESCO as the "best preserved small town in North Africa."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"It is not by chance that today's terrorism affects a country that represents hope for the Arab world. The hope for peace, the hope for stability, the hope for democracy. This hope must live," French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in a statement minutes after the crisis ended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Speaking at the Louvre museum to call for international efforts to preserve the heritage of Iraq and Syria against extremist destruction, French President Francois Hollande said he had called Tunisia's president to offer support and solidarity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Each time a terrorist crime is committed, we are all concerned," Hollande said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tunisia recently completed a rocky road to democracy after overthrowing its authoritarian president in 2011, seen by many as the start of the so-called Arab Spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The country has been more stable than others in the region, but has struggled with violence by Islamic extremists that have sworn allegiance to both al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A disproportionately large number of Tunisian recruits - some 3,000, according to government estimates - have joined Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The U.S. Embassy in Tunis was attacked in September 2012, seriously damaging the embassy grounds and an adjoining American school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Four of the assailants were killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Overall, though, violence in Tunisia in recent years has been largely focused on security forces, not foreigners or tourist sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In October 2013, a young man blew himself up on a beach in the coastal town of Sousse after being chased from a hotel, causing many to expect a new wave of attacks on tourism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>None materialized until now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>North Africa analyst Geoff Porter said an attack on a tourism site has long been expected as the militants come under pressure from increasingly effective Tunisian security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"Today's attack did not come out of nowhere. In fact, it comes amid ongoing counterterrorism efforts elsewhere in the country," he said about the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Increasing pressure on terrorist activities & may have squeezed the balloon, with terrorists seeking softer targets with more symbolic impact in the capital."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The attack came the day after Tunisian security officials confirmed the death in neighboring Libya of Ahmed Rouissi, leading suspect in Tunisian terror attacks and in the killings of two opposition figures in Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Rouissi had become a field commander for the Islamic State in Libya and died fighting near the town of Sirte, highlighting how Libya has increasingly become a sanctuary for Tunisian radicals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Tunisia has repeatedly expressed concern over the security threat from Libya, where central government has broken down since the 2011 ouster of Moammar Gadhafi and is now run by competing militias.</td></tr>

<h3>California: New mandatory water conservation rules for lawns, hotels, restaurants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"There have been some heroic efforts that people have taken, but we are not seeing the efforts to step up and ring the alarm bells that the situation warrants," said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, which approved the measures in Sacramento.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We're going to need to go further if it doesn't rain."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But enforcing the rules, which could carry fines of up to $500, will be left up to local cities, counties and water districts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And so far, very few have fined residents for wasting water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Critics called the rules, which take effect April 15, a step in the right direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But they said they are insufficient without more enforcement to avoid water shortages if the drought drags past this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"At this point, we are failing. We are not meeting our goals," said Conner Everts, with the California Environmental Water Caucus, a nonprofit group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"At what point do we accept that this might be the fourth year of a 10-year drought and plan for that?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The past three years have been the driest three years in California history dating back to the Gold Rush.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Tuesday, the Sierra snowpack was at 13 percent of its historic average, and many of the state's largest reservoirs were far below normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Meanwhile, 2014 was the hottest year in recorded history in California and around the globe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In January 2014, the governor declared a statewide drought emergency and asked Californians to cut water use by 20 percent voluntarily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But the state's urban and suburban residents have fallen short of that goal, cutting water use by only 9.7 percent from June to January, compared with the prior year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ban all restaurants, bars and hotels from serving water unless customers ask for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Require all hotels and motels to provide signs in rooms telling guests that they have the option of choosing not to have towels and linens washed daily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ban Californians from watering lawns and landscaping with potable water within 48 hours after measurable rainfall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Require cities, counties, water districts and private companies to limit lawn watering to two days a week if they aren't already limiting lawn and landscape watering to a certain number of days a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The rule applies to all 411 water providers with more than 3,000 customers in California, covering more than 95 percent of the state's population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But there is a loophole: If water providers are already limiting days of the week, even if it is to three or more days, they can continue with those rules and not restrict watering to two days a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The lawn-watering provisions are expected to have the most impact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That's because outdoor irrigation makes up 44 percent of water use in California's urban and suburban communities, according to the state water board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In the Bay Area, some water providers are already limiting lawn-watering days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Customers of the East Bay Municipal Utility District, which provides water to 1.3 million people in Alameda and Contra Costa counties, are limited to two days a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There is no enforcement, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The district has a hotline to report violations, and it calls, visits or sends emails to violators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But it has no ordinance on its books to allow the agency to issue fines, said district spokeswoman Abby Figueroa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That could change starting April 14, when the district will consider tougher rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Those will include "excessive use" fees for residents who use considerably more water than the community average and perhaps sending staff out to enforce the rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In Santa Clara County, watering rules vary widely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The San Jose Water Company, which provides water to 1 million residents, limits outdoor watering to odd or even days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>People whose addresses end in even numbers are allowed to water only on even-numbered dates, and those with addresses ending in odd numbers are allowed to water only on odd-numbered dates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But the company is not fining violators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Milpitas allows watering two days a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara and people served by San Jose's city water department do not have day-of-the-week restrictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The statewide rules passed Tuesday also require water providers to promptly notify property owners when they discover leaks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>And they mandate that water providers report every month to the state water board which days of the week they have limited watering and whether they are penalizing violators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Many Bay Area restaurants already are limiting water to diners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>At Delicious Crepes Bistro in Santa Clara, which serves vegan fare and whose mission statement promises to be environmentally friendly, the staff says it's already careful with wasting drinking water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>When the drought became serious last year, the restaurant added a water-filled thermos on the counter and asked customers to serve themselves, with a sign on the wall saying "take only as much as you can drink."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The glasses next to it hold only 12 ounces, the bistro's smallest glass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Originally, we poured water from a pitcher into bigger glasses," said Hanna Mityashina, 28, the cafe's manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"We noticed when we reduced the size of the glasses, it reduces the consumption. We want to preserve water."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Next door at Chef Ming's, owner Diana Lee said serving water to customers is part of being a polite hostess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"When I go to a restaurant, I hope someone can give me water -- cold water or hot tea," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Lee said she hopes the law is flexible enough that she can ask customers if they want water -- and not just wait for customers to request it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Already, she said, when water is left on tables "I throw it on my plants because I feel so guilty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Two of her customers, Marilyn Keever and Barbara Fairburn, said waiting for a water request is a good idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>But Keever joked that she has an even better one: "If you ask for water, you have to drink the whole thing, or you'll be arrested, handcuffed and taken away."</td></tr>
