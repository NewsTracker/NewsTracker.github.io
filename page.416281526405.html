<h3>Cannes unveils 2015 official selection lineup</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES - Star-studded English-language dramas from Todd Haynes, Gus Van Sant, Denis Villeneuve and Justin Kurzel will vie for the Palme d'Or alongside new films by Valerie Donzelli, Jacques Audiard, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Jia Zhangke at the 68th annual Cannes Film Festival, which unveiled its official selection lineup on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While there are only two U.S. directors in competition -- Haynes with "Carol," a 1950s lesbian love story starring Cate Blanchett, and Van Sant with his suicide drama "The Sea of Trees," pairing Matthew McConaughey and Ken Watanabe -- this year's Palme race looks to feature more high-profile Hollywood talent than any in recent memory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Canada's Villeneuve ("Prisoners," "Enemy") will bring his Mexican drug-cartel drama "Sicario," with Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin, while Australia's Kurzel ("The Snowtown Murders") secured a Palme berth for "Macbeth," his Shakespeare adaptation toplining Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In a further sign of the ever-increasing internationalization of film culture, two highly regarded European directors will make their Cannes competition debuts with English-lingo efforts: Greek helmer Yorgos Lanthimos ("Dogtooth") with "The Lobster," an out-there sci-fier with Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, and Norwegian director Joachim Trier with "Louder Than Bombs," a family drama with Isabelle Huppert, Gabriel Byrne and Jesse Eisenberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Outside the competition spotlight, American studio/specialty fare will be similarly well represented with world-premiere screenings of Woody Allen's "Irrational Man," starring Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone; George Miller's actioner "Mad Max: Fury Road," with Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron; and Pixar's latest toon extravaganza "Inside Out."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The latter will be joined out of competition by another animated feature, Mark Osborne's English-lingo adaptation of "The Little Prince," featuring voice work by Riley Osborne, Jeff Bridges, Del Toro and Cotillard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>These tantalizing prospects aside, Thursday morning's press conference in Paris left a number of question marks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Only 17 films were announced for competition and 14 in Un Certain Regard, both lower than the likely eventual totals, and Cannes delegate general Thierry Fremaux assured those in attendance that more pictures would be added to the lineup in the coming days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As it stands, while the proceedings will kick off with Emmanuelle Bercot's previously announced "La Tete haute," an out-of-competition entry starring Catherine Deneuve, the festival has yet to announce either a closing-night film or an opening film for Un Certain Regard, a program that runs parallel to the competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Of the many films that went unmentioned in Thursday's announcement (including Terence Davies' "Sunset Song," Miguel Gomes' "Arabian Nights" and Apichatpong Weerasethakul's "Love in Khon Kaen"), two of the most conspicuous and surprising no-shows were Arnaud Desplechin's "Nos arcadies" and Gaspar Noe's "Love."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The absence of these two Cannes mainstays can be chalked up in part to an unusually strong year for French cinema, which will be represented in competition by Jacques Audiard's immigrant drama "Erran"; Maiwenn's "Mon roi," a love story starring Bercot and Vincent Cassel; Valerie Donzelli's incest-themed drama "Marguerite and Julien"; and Stephane Brize's "A Simple Man," with Vincent Lindon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Donzelli and Maiwenn are the only two female directors competing for the Palme d'Or, a number in line with last year's; slotting Bercot's "La Tete haute" in competition would have brought the total to three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Still, the festival would seem to be making some attempt to address past criticisms of its underrepresentation of women -- not only by opening with its first female-directed movie in the nearly 30 years since Diane Kurys' "A Man in Love" (1987), but also by partnering with French luxury goods company Kering to present Women in Motion, a series of talks and panels highlighting women's achievements in cinema.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>2015 CANNES FILM FESTIVAL LINEUP OPENER "La Tete haute" (Emmanuelle Bercot, France).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Screening out of competition, Bercot's fourth feature (which she co-wrote with Marcia Romano) follows the troubled upbringing of a boy named Malony (Rod Paradot), and also stars Catherine Deneuve appearing as a juvenile judge who tries to intervene in his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As either actress or director, Bercot is no stranger to Cannes: Her 2001 helming debut, "Clement," made its premiere in Un Certain Regard, and she also won prizes at the festival for her short films "Les Vacances" (1997) and "La Puce" (1999).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>COMPETITION "The Assassin" (Hou Hsiao-hsien, Taiwan).</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>This Tang Dynasty-era martial-arts epic, starring Shu Qi and Chang Chen (the lovers in Hou's "Three Times"), is the Taiwanese auteur's first film since "Flight of the Red Balloon," which opened the festival's Un Certain Regard sidebar in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It will be his seventh time in competition, after 1993's "The Puppetmaster" (which received a jury prize), "Good Men, Good Women" (1995), "Goodbye, South, Goodbye" (1996), "Flowers of Shanghai" (2008), "Millennium Mambo" (2001) and "Three Times" (2007).</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Carol" (Todd Haynes, U.S.-U.K.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara star in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel about a lonely young department-store clerk who falls for an elegant older woman in 1950s New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Haynes' recent films ("Far From Heaven," "I'm Not There") have played the fall festival circuit, and this latest drama, which the Weinstein Co. is releasing Stateside this fall, will mark his first appearance at Cannes since 1998's "Velvet Goldmine," which received a prize for artistic contribution from the jury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Erran" (Jacques Audiard, France).</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Audiard has proven himself a specialist in gritty stories from Paris' underbelly, and his latest, already acquired by IFC's Sundance Selects for Stateside release, stars Vincent Rottiers as a Sri Lankan Tamil fighter working as a caretaker on a council estate in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Audiard was previously in competition with 1996's "A Self-Made Hero" (which won a screenplay prize), 2009's "A Prophet" (which received the Grand Prix), and 2012's "Rust and Bone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The Lobster" (Yorgos Lanthimos, Greece-U.K.-Ireland-Netherlands-France).</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Lanthimos won the 2009 Un Certain Regard prize for his attention-grabbing "Dogtooth," and wound up bypassing a second Un Certain Regard slot in favor of a Venice competition berth for "Alps" (2011).</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This time, he cracks the big leagues with a love story set in a dystopian future where single people are arrested and forced to find a mate within 45 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Ben Whishaw, Olivia Colman, Lea Seydoux and John C. Reilly star in the mostly Irish-financed production.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Our Little Sister" (Hirokazu Kore-eda, Japan).</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A strong Japanese female cast, led by Masami Nagasawa, Haruka Ayase and Suzu Hirose, headlines this adaptation of Akimi Yoshida's popular serialized comic about four sisters living in the eponymous city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Kore-eda received a jury prize and an ecumenical prize at Cannes just two years ago for "Like Father, Like Son," and he was also in competition with "Nobody Knows" (2004) and "Distance" (2001).</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>His 2009 film "Air Doll" premiered in Un Certain Regard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Louder Than Bombs" (Joachim Trier, Norway-France-Denmark).</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Trier was previously in Un Certain Regard with his well-received "Oslo, August 31st" (2011), and he cracks the competition for the first time with this starry English-language drama about the secrets that emerge about a war photographer (Isabelle Huppert) three years after her death in a car accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Gabriel Byrne and Jesse Eisenberg star as her husband and son, respectively; the cast also includes David Strathairn and Amy Ryan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>(Sales: Memento Films Intl.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Macbeth" (Justin Kurzel, U.K.-France-U.S.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard play Shakespeare's bloodthirsty power couple in this Scottish-filmed adaptation (which will also offer a foretaste of this year's other Cotillard-Fassbender-Kurzel collaboration, "Assassin's Creed").</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The competition berth marks a big step up for Australian director Kurzel from his trip to the Croisette in 2011, when "Snowtown," his psychological chiller about the serial killer John Bunting, bowed in the festival's parallel Critics' Week sidebar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"Marguerite and Julien" (Valerie Donzelli, France).</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Co-written by Donzelli and her regular collaborator Jeremie Elkaim, this tale of an incestuous love affair between the two eponymous siblings (played by Anais Demoustier and Jeremie Elkaim) is based on a 1971 Jean Gruault script that was almost filmed by Francois Truffaut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The competition slot reps a big boost for Donzelli after her 2011 Critics' Week hit, "Declaration of War."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"Mon roi" (Maiwenn, France).</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>In addition to opening the festival with "La Tete haute," Emmanuelle Bercot stars here as a woman recovering from a passionate but destructive romance; her lover is played by Vincent Cassel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Maiwenn was previously at Cannes with her ensemble drama "Polisse" (2011), which won a jury prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"Mountains May Depart" (Jia Zhangke, China-Japan-France).</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Jia's first feature shot outside his native China is a generations-spanning drama that unfolds in three parts, set in the 1990s, the present day and 2025, respectively.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The filmmaker has had three prior films in competition at Cannes: "Unknown Pleasures" (2002), "24 City" (2008) and "A Touch of Sin" (2013), which won a screenplay prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>His 2010 documentary, "I Wish I Knew," screened in Un Certain Regard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"My Mother" (Nanni Moretti).</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>In her third collaboration with Moretti, Margherita Buy plays a filmmaker weathering a number of behind-the-scenes crises in this sardonic tragicomedy, also starring John Turturro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>In addition to his Palme d'Or-winning "The Son's Room" (2001), Moretti has had five previous films in competition at Cannes: "Ecce bombo" (1978); "Dear Diary" (1994), which won him a directing prize; "Aprile" (1998); "The Caiman" (2006); and "We Have a Pope" (2011).</td></tr>

<tr><td>60</td><td>Since then, Villeneuve has become one of the most sought-after talents in Hollywood, and he cracks the competition for the first time with this crime drama starring Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Jon Bernthal, and set against the backdrop of the Mexican drug trade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>(Sales: Lionsgate Intl.)</td></tr>
