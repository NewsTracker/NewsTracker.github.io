<h3>Ben mother in greece tv appeal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The mother of missing Ben Needham has travelled to Greece to make a direct TV appeal with UK police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ben, from Sheffield, vanished on July 24 1991 after travelling to the Greek island of Kos with his mother Kerry Needham and his grandparents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>South Yorkshire Police have confirmed Mrs Needham and Ben's grandmother Christine Needham will be taking part in the TV show on Friday along with his sister Leighanna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Also taking part will be Detective Superintendent Matthew Fenwick and Detective Inspector Jon Cousins, the force said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The show, the English translation of which is Light At The End Of The Tunnel, broadcasts to around 50% of the Greek TV audience and is about missing people, a spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It will air between 9pm and 11pm UK time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In January, South Yorkshire Police were granted Home Office funding to support the Greek authorities in continuing inquiries to find Ben.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The force asked for the financial help to follow up information the family believes has never been properly investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The funding is for the financial year from April 2015 and is for up to 700,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Home Office backed a South Yorkshire Police operation in 2012 when land was excavated on Kos, near the farmhouse from where Ben went missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>No trace of him was found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mrs Needham posted on her fundraising site today: "As part of the launch of operation Ben I have arrived in Athens this morning with my family and detectives from South Yorkshire Police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"During our five days here we will be meeting the British ambassador for the first time in 23 years to discuss Ben's case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Myself and family along with British detectives will be appearing on the Greek missing programme Nikolouli as well as holding a press conference with all Greek media as well as any British media who would like to attend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We sincerely hope this will lead to more people coming forward with new information and will help the British and Greek police investigate into the whereabouts of Ben. Once again we would like to thank you all for your continued support."</td></tr>
