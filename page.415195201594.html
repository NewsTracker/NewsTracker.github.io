<tr><td>3</td><td>He is the first city official from Ferguson to speak since the Department of Justice released its findings following an investigation into the Ferguson Police Department.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>Ferguson officials can agree to the recommendations in full and enter into a "consent decree" with the DOJ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That gives federal authorities oversight as changes are implemented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>If Ferguson refused to comply with the recommendations, the Department of Justice could sue the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Nobody from the city would answer any questions related to Ferguson's legal plans.</td></tr>
