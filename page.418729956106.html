<h3>Technology shares lead a slump in US stocks; Apple sinks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - This July 15, 2013, file photo, shows the New York Stock Exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A cautious outlook from Apple coupled with indifferent earnings from U.S. technology firms weighed on global stock markets Wednesday, July 22, 2015, ahead of another key vote in the Greek Parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>U.S. stocks notched their second decline in as many days Wednesday, pulled down by a technology stock slump headlined by Apple and Microsoft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Both companies delivered disappointing quarterly results or outlooks the night before, setting the stage for the sell-off in the technology sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Apple is the biggest publicly traded company in the world, so it's going to have a big impact on the indices," noted Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The slide wasn't that broad, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Financial and utilities stocks were among the big gainers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And homebuilders got a boost from a report indicating U.S. home sales surged last month to the fastest pace in more than eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Dow Jones industrial average slid 68.25 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,851.04.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5.06 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,114.15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Nasdaq composite shed 36.35 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,171.77.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The tech-heavy index, which hit a new high on Monday, remains the best-performing index for the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's up 9.2 percent, while the S&P 500 is up 2.7 percent and the Dow is essentially flat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Five of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 index declined, led by a 1.6 percent drop in technology stocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Financials led the gainers, rising 0.7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The major stock indexes declined from the get-go as traders reacted to weaker showings late Tuesday from Microsoft, Yahoo and Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Yahoo posted a nearly $22 million loss driven by soaring commissions paid to its partners and flat sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The stock slipped 49 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $39.24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Microsoft's slide was more pronounced at 3.7 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The company reported a hefty quarterly loss stemming from an expense of $8.4 billion related to its purchase of the Nokia phone business over a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The stock lost $1.74 to $45.54.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Apple fared the worst, shedding 4.2 percent after management gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter and didn't provide much detail on how the company's new smartwatch was doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Apple's latest results also stirred investor concerns about a slowdown in the growth of iPhone sales.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The stock fell $5.53 to 125.22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Despite its size, Apple's latest results don't necessarily speak to the overall health of the economy or corporate America, Davidson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Do iPhone sales tell us a lot about the broader economy and the markets or does it tell us more about Apple? It probably tells us more about Apple," Davidson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"In general, you have a U.S. economy that is recovering. Earnings are going fairly well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Several other companies, including consumer reviews service Angie's List, Tupperware Brands and Packaging Corp. of America reported earnings or revenue that fell short of Wall Street's expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Whirlpool and Chipotle Mexican Grill were among the companies whose earnings impressed investors Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Shares in Whirlpool vaulted $12.15, or 7.3 percent, to $178.36, while Chipotle gained $52.75, or 7.8 percent, to $725.82.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Investors have their eye on company earnings and outlooks to get a sense of how the economy is doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Of the roughly 104 companies that have reported so far, about 70 percent of them delivered results that beat Wall Street estimates, according to S&P Capital IQ.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>McDonald's and Caterpillar are among the other big-name companies reporting earnings on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>In a light week of economic news, the market got encouraging data on the housing market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The National Association of Realtors said that sales of previously occupied homes climbed 3.2 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>That's the highest pace in more than eight years and indicates that demand has eclipsed the amount of homes available for sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Homebuilder shares got a bump from the report, with New Home notching the biggest gain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The stock rose 99 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $17.81.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"It may be tough to keep that pace, but it really shows how much the housing market is going in the right direction, and along with employment, there's a lot of hope for the economy," said JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The price of oil closed below $50 for the first time since April after the government reported a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Oil inventories typically shrink this time of year because demand is high, and analysts had expected a decline of 1.9 million barrels, according to Platts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Instead, crude supplies increased by 2.5 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration's weekly status report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.67 to close at $49.19 a barrel in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, fell 91 cents to close at $56.13 a barrel in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline fell 5.3 cents to close at $1.868 a gallon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Heating oil fell 0.6 cents to close at $1.672 a gallon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Natural gas rose 1.5 cents to close at $2.897 per 1,000 cubic feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Precious and industrial metals futures fell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Gold lost $12 to $1,091.50 an ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Silver gave up six cents to $14.71 an ounce and copper declined five cents to $2.43 an ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Bond prices didn't move much.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.33 percent.</td></tr>
