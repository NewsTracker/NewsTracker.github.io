<h3>Ellis, Barea keep Mavs alive with 121-109 win over Rockets (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DALLAS (AP) -- J.J. Barea last started a playoff game when he helped boost Dallas' run to a championship four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Al-Farouq Aminu had never been on the floor for the opening tip in a postseason game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They helped give the Mavericks at least one more game in a first-round series with Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Barea and Aminu recorded their first career postseason double-doubles to go with 31 points from Monta Ellis, and Dallas avoided elimination with a 121-109 victory over the Rockets on Sunday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''We weren't ready to go home,'' Ellis said after the Mavericks cut Houston's series lead to 3-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Game 5 is Tuesday night in Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Barea had 17 points and 13 assists, while Aminu finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tyson Chandler had 10 points and 14 boards as Dallas outrebounded Houston 52-38 after offensive rebounding was a key for the Rockets in a Game 3 win that put them on the verge of their first playoff series victory since 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>James Harden scored 24 points, and Dwight Howard had 13 for Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But the big man was kept under control after scoring 10 points with two more alley-oop dunks in the first quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He had seven rebounds after getting a playoff career-high 26 in Game 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Rockets missed 17 consecutive shots covering the second and third quarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The most-prolific 3-point shooting team in NBA history in the regular season was 7 of 31 from long range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''We're very upset about the way we handled ourselves tonight,'' Howard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''It's not becoming of a championship team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It starts with myself and James.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Barea was one of coach Rick Carlisle's starting guards in the postseason for the first time since Game 4 of the 2011 NBA Finals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He started the last three games of that series against Miami, all Dallas wins on the way to the title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Generously listed at 6-foot, Barea, who spent the past three seasons in Minnesota, energized a Dallas offense that never was right after the failed trade for Rajon Rondo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He helped Dallas avoid just the second sweep in 14 trips to the playoffs with Dirk Nowitzki, who had 10 of his 16 points to help the Mavericks keep a safe distance in the fourth quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Barea led a 24-7 run in the first half after the Rockets had gone up 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Another 20-2 run with him running the offense in the third quarter was capped by his 3-pointer and a spinning layup by Ellis that gave Dallas its biggest lead at 81-57.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''We're going to fight,'' Barea said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''We're not going to quit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Rockets were 2 of 21 from long range going into the fourth, when they made five of their first six shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Josh Smith, who scored 23 points, had four of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But Houston never got closer than nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Howard, who paired with Smith for five alley-oop dunks in a key fourth-quarter run of Houston's Game 2 win, looked as if he was going to do it again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>One of his alley-oops was a spectacular running, one-handed slam that got a big roar from pockets of red-clad fans scattered among the Dallas fans in blue playoff T-shirts that were waiting on their seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But Howard had just one point in the second quarter and was 1 of 6 from the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Two of the misses came after Devin Harris was called for a flagrant foul when he wrapped his arms around the 6-11 center and threw him to the ground as Howard tried to go up for a shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Howard finished 3 of 13 from the line and wasn't much of a factor after Harris' hard foul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''It's a big play,'' Carlisle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''When you're at home, you've got to keep the energy up, you've got to keep the aggression up and you've got to do it in a way that's clean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>It was a hard foul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The Rockets shot 68 percent in the first quarter, but just 28 percent (11 of 40) in the second and third combined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Mavericks outscored Houston 69-41 in those two quarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Besides a spirited effort around the basket, Aminu was Dallas' leading 3-pointer shooter, making three of five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>''All year long, I've been working on it,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Rockets: Smith was called for a technical for his reaction after getting intentionally fouled by Harris in the third quarter, and Howard and Chandler were assessed double-technical in the fourth - the fourth and fifth of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>... Corey Brewer had 22 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Mavericks: Aminu started in place of Richard Jefferson, who is battling a calf injury but played.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Jefferson had been starting for Chandler Parsons, out for the playoffs and awaiting right knee surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>... Carlisle, who was fined $25,000 for comments about officiating after a Game 3 loss, was called for a technical foul complaining about a foul against Nowitzki.</td></tr>
