<h3>Obama, EU to put more costs on Russia if needed</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The threats came in statements issued after a video conference that brought together Obama and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy, as well as the head of the European Council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The virtual meeting took place amid continuing violence in Ukraine despite the two-week-old ceasefire accord reached in Minsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ukrainian MP, Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, says the country cannot make necessary reforms at the same time as fighting a war against Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama used the call to condemn Russia for not following through on its agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It was an opportunity ... for the president to condemn the continuing failure of Russia and the separatists it backs to abide by the commitments to which they agreed," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The top U.S. military officer, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey, told a Senate hearing on Tuesday the United States should "absolutely" consider providing lethal weapons to Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He acknowledged that Russia could take Ukraine if it wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But Dempsey said the United States should look for opportunities to level the playing field between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists, in the unlikely event "the Russians are actually telling the truth" when they deny aiding their sympathizers in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Obama and the European leaders agreed that a major breach of the ceasefire pact would make a "strong reaction from the international community" necessary, the office of French President Francois Hollande said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Leaders will be ready to decide on further sanctions if the Minsk agreements are further violated," said a European Union statement that was echoed by one from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The French statement also said the parties wanted to bolster the resources of monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a European rights and security watchdog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>European leaders on Monday said they agreed that the OSCE needed a broader role as observers of the ceasefire and removal of weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Tuesday, Kiev announced its highest casualty toll in several days, with three Ukrainian servicemen dead and nine wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Later this week, Ukraine's parliament is expected to back Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's request for international peacekeepers to monitor the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>That idea, however, has faced a chilly reception in Europe.</td></tr>
