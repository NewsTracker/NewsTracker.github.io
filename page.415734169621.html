<h3>Lawyer: Police shooting suspect didn't fire gun in Ferguson</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jeffrey L. Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutors allege that Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But his attorney, Jerryl Christmas, said Williams told him he never fired a weapon that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Christmas said witnesses he spoke to indicated there was a shooting among demonstrators that didn't appear to target police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>FILE - In this file photo provided by the St. Louis County Police Department on March 15, 2015 is Jeffrey Williams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Williams, 20, is accused of shooting two police officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I think the real shooter is still at large, and that's what our focus should be: getting the real shooter in custody," Christmas told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"(Williams) never fired a weapon that night and he never told anybody he fired a weapon."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Christmas said he has not yet seen any evidence against Williams, including a police affidavit alleging that a confidential informant recorded Williams talking about the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The search warrant was first obtained by Yahoo News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One officer was shot in the face, the other in the shoulder; both are expected to recover.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch has said authorities are still trying to determine if the officers were targeted or inadvertently struck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Williams is charged with felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He is jailed on $300,000 bond, but Christmas said he will ask a judge during a hearing next week to reduce bond to $100,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Williams, who is black, was arrested March 15, following an intense manhunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Authorities have said he didn't resist, but Christmas said Williams told him that two St. Louis County officers - one black and one white - beat him in the head with a pistol, choked him, and beat him across the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police have denied the claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ferguson has been a national focal point since a white police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A grand jury in November declined to indict the former officer, Darren Wilson, who also was cleared of civil rights violations by the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But a separate DOJ report found widespread racial bias in Ferguson's policing and in a municipal court system, which it said was driven by profit mostly extracted from black and low-income residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Several city officials were fired or resigned following the report.</td></tr>
