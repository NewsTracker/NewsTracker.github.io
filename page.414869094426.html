<h3>Hugo Selenski who killed Michael Kerkowski and Tammy Fassett escapes death penalty</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hugo Selenski was convicted last week on two counts of first-degree murder in the 2002 strangulation deaths of Michael Kerkowski and Tammy Fassett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Police found their bodies, along with three other sets of human remains, in Selenski's yard in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Gruesome discovery: Police say the bodies of Tammy Fassett and Michael Kerkowksi were found buried in Selenski's back yard in Kingston Township in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>First Assistant District Attorney Sam Sanguedolce said Wednesday in his closing argument that Selenski tortured Kerkowski before killing him and has a long history of violent crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Those are two aggravating circumstances the jury can use to sentence Selenski to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pennsylania's governor recently declared a moratorum on the death penalty, but the law remains on the books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prosecutors said Selenski, 41, and a co-conspirator brutally beat Kerkowski to compel him to reveal the location of tens of thousands of dollars he kept in his house then used flex ties to strangle him and Fassett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Authorities found their decomposing bodies about a year later, along with at least three other sets of human remains on Selenski's property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Selenski, who is already serving decades in prison for an unrelated robbery, escaped from prison months after his 2003 arrest using a rope fashioned from bed sheets, and he spent three days on the run before turning himself in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The jury reached its verdict last week after deliberating more than 11 hours over two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It convicted Selenski of eight of 10 counts, including first-degree murder and robbery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prosecutors and defense lawyers, under a gag order, were unable to comment on the verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One of Selenski's sisters cried quietly and left the courtroom after hearing the verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The victims' relatives remained stoic, hugging prosecutors after the jury exited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>'Thirteen years,' murmured Kerkowski's mother, Geraldine Kerkowski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Later, Selenski's brother Ronald Selenski Jr. rushed toward an elevator holding the victims' relatives and prosecutors, and pointed a finger at them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sheriff's deputies walked him away from the elevator and put him in handcuffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It wasn't immediately clear whether he would be charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Hugo Selenski has been a familiar face in northeastern Pennsylvania since his 2003 arrest on charges he killed a pair of drug dealers whose charred remains also were found on the property north of Wilkes-Barre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In 2006, a jury acquitted him of one homicide and deadlocked on another but convicted him of abusing the men's corpses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After the verdict, authorities immediately charged him with killing Kerkowski and Fassett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Kerkowski, from Hunlock Creek, had pleaded guilty to running a prescription drug ring that netted at least $800,000 and was about to be sentenced when he and Fassett were reported missing in May 2002.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They were both 37 years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Selenski saw an opportunity to scam Kerkowski, getting the pharmacist to give him tens of thousands of dollars for legal work he never performed, prosecutors alleged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But Selenski quickly burned through all the money and needed another $10,000 to cover a check that his girlfriend, Christina Strom, had written to purchase a house, giving him a motive to rob and kill Kerkowski before the pharmacist headed to prison on the drug charges, prosecutors said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The defense contended Selenski was framed by another man, Paul Weakley, who led police to Selenski's yard in June 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Weakley later pleaded guilty in federal court, testified against Selenski to avoid the death penalty and could ask for a reduction of his life prison sentence because of his cooperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Weakley, who met Selenski in prison in the 1990s, told jurors how he plotted with Selenski to kill Kerkowski and then helped him carry out the crimes and bury the bodies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He described how he and Selenski bound the victims and covered their eyes with duct tape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Weakley said Kerkowski, who was beaten with a rolling pin, told them where to find his hidden bags of cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>He said Fassett was killed simply because she was with Kerkowski when they showed up at the pharmacist's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>After the killings, Selenski stole tens of thousands more dollars that Kerkowski had given to his father for safekeeping, pointing a gun at the father and threatening him, other witnesses said.</td></tr>

<h3>Justice Dept. examining Ferguson racial discrimination</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CNN reported the Justice Department is preparing to bring a lawsuit against Ferguson if the police department does not make changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In August, Ferguson was thrust into the limelight when white police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teen Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Justice Department is not expected to charge Wilson, but could outline a pattern of discriminatory practices used by the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"If they don't agree to review and revise those tactics, sources say, the Justice Department would sue to force changes in the department," CNN reported, adding there would be court supervision over the changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Thomas Harvey, executive director of Arch City Defenders, said he and others have met with the Justice Department, including Christy Lopez, the deputy chief of the department's Civil Rights Special Litigation Section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"All discussions with the Justice Department have focused on what we believe to be a connection between the allegations of police misconduct and the erosion of trust between members of communities of color and their government," Harvey told Politico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In early February, 15 residents filed a federal lawsuit against Ferguson and Jennings for what amounts to a modern-day debtors prison, putting poor people behind bars for minor offenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The jails are often overcrowded and unsanitary, the lawsuits said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The lawsuits, which seek class-action status, say the cities use the money to generate revenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Ferguson Police issued a statement refuting the claims.</td></tr>
