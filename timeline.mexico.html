<li>After escape, Mexico's strongest cartel boss faces radically altered drug-trafficking business</li>

<li>Only the Jalisco New Generation, the big gun cartel that forced down the helicopter, has used the void to grow into one of Mexico's most powerful international criminal groups.</li>
<li>"The Jalisco cartel has been growing ... and Sinaloa was debilitated by the arrest of El Chapo," said Raul Benitez, a security expert with the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</li>
