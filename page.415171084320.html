<h3>Liberia calls for Ebola 'Marshall Plan' to rebuild economies</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said that "we need our international partners to remain committed to us," as the number of deaths from the disease approaches 10,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sirleaf told fellow regional leaders and delegates at an international conference on Ebola in Brussels that restoring economic growth in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone is a long-term and costly task.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She said that "the most important long-term response to Ebola rests on plans and strategies for economic recovery," adding that "this will require significant resources, perhaps even a Marshall Plan," referring to the vast U.S. plan which helped Europe recover from World War II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The outbreak is focused in an area of West Africa about the size of France, with a population of about 20 million people, and where infrastructure is limited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Even if the number of new Ebola cases in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone has dropped markedly, bringing it down to zero will still take a significant effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ebola has undermined the three countries' already fragile economies, shifting resources resulting in other health care problems and hurting business as people grew scared to leave their homes or go to markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are talking about a Marshall Plan because Ebola is like a war," Guinea President Alpha Conde said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>About $4.9 billion has been pledged internationally to the Ebola effort, but only around $2.4 billion has actually been disbursed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nevertheless, important progress has been made as the number of new cases of Ebola has dropped to about 100 per week, down from 800-900 at the height of the outbreak in August and September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But experts and officials warn that eradicating the last cases poses a huge challenge, requiring everyone to be tracked down and treated, and the close monitoring of all people they may have come in contact with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We have turned the corner, but even as we have shown an improvement in results, the virus is still with us. We are still in a fight," Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also warned against any loss of momentum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The Ebola outbreak is not over and complacency, both at local and global levels, would be one of our worst enemies," Elhadj As Sy said.</td></tr>

<h3>Russia bids farewell to slain Putin critic Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Moscow: Russia's beleaguered opposition queued with flowers in the frost to pay their respects to slain liberal politician Boris Nemtsov, many voicing the fear that with him they were burying the last hopes of democracy in their long-suffering country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Behind a police barricade, thousands stood in a line that snaked all the way from Moscow's Kursky railway station to the memorial centre for Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, where Nemtsov's body lay for public viewing in an open coffin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A Russian woman holds orchids at the front of a line for the funeral of Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I had to come," said Arina Borodina, who works for Echo of Moscow radio, where Nemtsov gave his last interview hours before being shot dead within view of the Kremlin last Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"For me, his death is first and foremost a matter of personal pain. But it is also the crash of all our hopes. Boris was a man of his word and a broad soul. He was a real Russian, in the true, not the chauvinistic sense."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mikhail Gokhman, a free-thinking journalist who is no longer able to find work in the state-dominated media, had also known Nemtsov personally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Boris was not like other politician," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He would drop everything to engage with and try to convince those who disagreed with him. He worked tirelessly to heal rifts in the opposition. He never lost hope.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"But sadly now in Russia, with every passing day, we have less and less hope. Some 50,000 people came out on Sunday to protest the murder but what is that compared with the reaction to the Charlie Hebdo killings, when all of Paris were on the streets?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Men place candles as they arrive at a farewell ceremony to slain opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Maria Belova, a psychologist carrying tulips for Nemtsov, put the apparent indifference of the general Russian population down to fear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The NKVD or KGB (Soviet terms for the secret police) have never left us," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"People live like slaves in a feudal society. There's no alternative media; no internet in the provinces. Most people depend on the state for their jobs. Of course they are afraid. Only a few of us are not brainwashed, and our only hope now is world opinion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Like others in the queue, Ms Belova said she would have voted for Nemtsov had there been free elections, giving the lie to the oft-repeated view that there is simply no alternative to President Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She was young too, giving the lie to the notion that Nemtsov was a "yesterday's man" from the 1990s, whom only the middle-aged remembered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nemtsov was a "golden boy" when the late President Boris Yeltsin promoted him from a regional governorship to the job of deputy prime minister and he was tipped as a possible heir to the sick and ageing Kremlin leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Instead that role went to former KGB agent Vladimir Putin, who set about sidelining and removing all opposition to his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>People line up to pay their last respects at the coffin of Boris Nemtsov inside the Sakharov centre in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But Nemtsov refused to go quietly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Briefly jailed in 2011 for protesting against the second conviction and further imprisonment of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Nemtsov regularly led rallies in defence of constitutional freedoms and human rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He famously criticised overspending on the 2014 Sochi Olympics, saying that Russia's roads could have been paved with caviar for the $65-billion cost of the Games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It was believed he was preparing to release a report on Russian military involvement in the war in Ukraine, which may have cost him his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In his last interview to Echo of Moscow, he recalled the absurdity of being arrested for carrying a Russian tricolour on national Flag Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>That flag, he said, represented the freedom that Russians had seized for themselves when Boris Yeltsin had jumped on a tank to resist the hardline coup in 1991.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Nemtsov said he never recognised President Putin's reintroduction of the melody of the old Soviet national anthem and all that implied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>People gather to pay their last respects at the coffin of Boris Nemtsov during the farewell ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>While investigators, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, who once made death threats to a journalist, now seek Nemtsov's killers, mourners at the funeral were in no doubt that the professional hit was carried out by the security services or rogue elements emboldened by state propaganda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I never felt safe here," said Vasily Andrushenko, who runs an internet business, "but now another line has been crossed and we see our rulers are ready to go beyond the 'civilised' methods they used with Navalny (Alexei, the opposition blogger currently in jail)."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The death of Nemtsov is the end of hope," said teacher Irina Shebanova. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He was clean and honest, the exact opposite of those in power today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Now all we can do is sit quietly at home, and shut our mouths, and be grateful we are still alive.</td></tr>
