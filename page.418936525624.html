<h3>Facebook's giant drone to beam internet to remote regions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Photo: Facebook's internet beaming drone will have the same wingspan as a Boeing 737 but will weigh less than a car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Facebook has completed building its first full-scale, solar-powered drone, which has the wingspan of a Boeing 737 and is hoped to provide internet access to the most remote parts of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Aquila aircraft, which weighs less than a car and can stay in the air for months at a time, will be tested in the US later this year Facebook said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The plane will weigh about 400 kilograms said Yael Maguire, the company's engineering director of connectivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It will hover between 60,000 feet (18,000 metres) and 90,000 feet (27,000 metres) above the altitude of commercial aeroplanes, so it is not affected by problematic weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Our mission is to connect everybody in the world," said Jay Parikh, vice president of engineering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is going to be a great opportunity for us to motivate the industry to move faster on this technology."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The drone, which was built in 14 months, is able to fly in the air for 90 days at a time, Mr Maguire said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Helium balloons will be attached to the plane and float it up into the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The drone has a wingspan of 42 metres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Because the plane must constantly move to stay aloft, it will circle a three-kilometre radius, Mr Parikh said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>During the day, it will float up to 27,000 metres and at night will drift down to 18,000 metres to conserve energy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The drone is the first in a program called Aquila, which is geared towards the 10 per cent of the population that does not have any internet access, executives said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Separately, Facebook a year ago launched internet.org, an initiative to provide internet access to the two-thirds of the world that do not have a reliable connection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Parikh said Facebook is not planning to sell the drones but will use them to expand internet access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Although Facebook does not immediately face policy or legal hurdles in testing its drone in the US, Mr Maguire said, it is the first company to fly at such altitudes.</td></tr>
