<h3>The Latest: As Greek bailout talks resume, Finnish premier slams talk of government collapse</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said Greece's European creditors just don't trust the Greek government enough to do what it says it will do on the economic reform front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As a result, he said a deal that would secure Greece's future in the euro won't be clinched at Sunday's meetings in Brussels, first of the eurozone's 19 finance ministers and then of its leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We continue to work to establish the conditions to start negotiations, which is the real target," Padoan said as he arrived for talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It is not about closing a deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Let's face it, the main obstacle to moving forward is lack of trust," Padoan added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece's banks, according to many accounts, have barely enough cash in their vaults to see the country through the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Greece's banks have been shuttered for the best part of two weeks and daily withdrawals from ATMs have been limited to a paltry 60 euros ($67).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The economy is in a freefall and the country faces big debt repayments in coming weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece has already defaulted on a 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) payment to the International Monetary Fund last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It has another 4.2 billion-euro payment on July 20 due to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Greece has asked Europe's bailout fund for a 53.5 billion-euro 3-year financial package but many EU officials believe that won't be enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The finance minister of Cyprus, a traditional ally of Greece, says a way can be found to secure Greece's place in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However, Harris Georgiades warned that choices based on "populism, slogans and extremes" won't lead to a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Georgiades spoke as he headed into a meeting of the eurozone's 19 finance ministers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On Saturday, the so-called eurogroup broke up after more than eight hours of discussions having failed to make a breakthrough over the Greek crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We have to work less on the basis of emotion and more on the basis of reason and the difficult, but necessary choices that till create prospects, " said Georgiades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Georgiades said Cyprus stands firmly behind Greece in tough negotiations with its European creditors because it wants to see the country remain in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb said he was "still hopeful" for a deal on Greece's financial crisis, but the two sides were "still very, very far away."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He said in a scale of 1-to-10, Greece and its 18 partners in the eurozone were only "somewhere between 3 and 4" when it came to any agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Stubb denied that Finland was blocking an agreement, saying all countries were trying to find an exit from a "very difficult situation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Greece has asked Europe's bailout fund for a 53.5 billion-euro ($59.5 billion) 3-year financial package but many EU officials believe that won't be enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>European Union President Donald Tusk has decided to cancel a summit of the bloc's 28 leaders and instead center only on a summit of the 19 eurozone leaders to find a solution on Greece's bailout crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In an early morning tweet, Tusk said the eurozone summit would start in mid- afternoon "and last until we conclude talks" on Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>For the Greek bailout talks to be successful, European officials say it's all about trust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Greece will have another, possibly its last, chance Sunday to convince skeptical European creditors it can be trusted to enact wide-ranging economic reforms that would safeguard its future in the common euro currency used by 19 European nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The talks in Brussels resume at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT), just a few hours before the European Union's 28 leaders descend for a summit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The two sides negotiated for eight hours Saturday where Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurozone's top official, says "the issue of credibility and trust was discussed."</td></tr>
