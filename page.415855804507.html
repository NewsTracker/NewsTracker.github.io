<h3>Obama to make presidential trip to father's homeland Kenya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Barack Obama will make a long-awaited trip to Kenya later this year, visiting his father's homeland for the first time since becoming US president six years ago, the White House said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>During the long-promised visit this July, Obama will attend a Global Entrepreneurship Summit in the east African nation, a statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Obama has visited Africa four times since becoming president, but has not visited the country where he still has relatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For much of Obama's presidency, Kenya's leaders have been under a cloud of prosecution by the International Criminal Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kenyatta was indicted over the country's 2007-08 post-election violence, the worst since it won independence from Britain in 1963.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kenyatta has always protested his innocence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The case was dropped in December, with prosecutors complaining that they had been undermined by a lack of cooperation by the Kenyan government, as well as the bribing or intimidation of witnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"President Obama will meet him in Kenya," a White House official told AFP, confirming a meeting that is likely to court controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The official, who asked not to be named, said the United States regularly raises "concerns with the Kenyan government about restrictions on human rights and fundamental freedoms."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The president's trip will create another opportunity for dialogue with the government and civil society on these issues."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Obama had visited Kenya before as a senator and before entering politics, visiting his father's home village and taking a very public HIV test.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The president's origins have spurred domestic controversy, with some hardline political foes claiming he was not born in the United States and so was ineligible to become president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Obama allies say this is thinly veiled racism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The president has often made light of the controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If I did not love America, I wouldn't have moved here from Kenya," he recently joked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>On this visit, Obama expected to take part in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), which is being held in sub-Saharan Africa for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Hosting the GES is an opportunity for Kenya to showcase its economic progress," said the White House official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Kenya maintains enormous potential for economic growth, thanks to the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of the Kenyan people."</td></tr>
