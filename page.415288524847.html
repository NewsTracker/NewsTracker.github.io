<h3>Tony and Cherie Blair: Former UK PM and lawyer wife offer advice from Albania to Kazakhstan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mr Blair is a special adviser to Vietnam's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>London: Former British prime minister Tony Blair advised an African president on how to win over public support in the aftermath of clashes in which opposition protesters were shot dead by security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Blair's guidance is contained in a four-page communications strategy document drawn up for Alpha Conde, the President of Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The document offers a guide to Mr Conde on how to improve his government's image after mass civil unrest in February and March 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>British lawyer Cherie Blair in Melbourne in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Nine protesters died and hundreds were injured in clashes with government forces who were accused of quelling public unrest by firing on demonstrators with live ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The strategy outlined in the document,that might be seen as cynical and more probably replicates public relations techniques used in Downing Street than in west Africa, includes a timetable for talks with the opposition, which, Mr Blair and his team know, are doomed to fail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In another part of the world, Tony Blair's wife, Cherie Blair, has picked up a lucrative legal contract with the Albanian government, a little over a year after her husband began acting as its official adviser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Her law firm, Omnia Strategy, has been appointed to act on behalf of Albania in a 250 million ($487 million) legal dispute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Blair is an official adviser to the government, prompting calls by opposition MPs for more transparency in the country's dealings with the Blairs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The deal in Albania follows the awarding of a contract to Ms Blair by the Kazakhstan government, where her husband is also an official, paid adviser to the country's autocratic president, Nursultan Nazarbayev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It is not clear how much Mrs Blair is being paid by Albania, but if it is anything like as lucrative as the Kazakh deal, she will be delighted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Omnia Strategy was paid almost 400,000 for six months' work in Kazakhstan for reviewing its "bilateral investment treaties".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ms Blair, best known as a human rights lawyer, charged the Kazakh government 975 an hour for her fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She normally charges 1150 an hour, but offered her services to the Kazakh taxpayer at a reduced rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The awarding of the Albanian contract to Ms Blair has raised concerns in Albania with Mr Blair so close to the heart of the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Florjon Mima, a Democratic party MP and former minister, said: "I am deeply surprised that the firm of the spouse of the former British prime minister Blair has been awarded a contract to render legal services representing the Albanian government, while . . . her husband is publicly recognised as an adviser to the Albanian government and a personal friend to the Albanian Prime Minister."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ms Blair is thought to have first visited Albania in 2010 as the guest of Liri Berisha, the wife of the prime minister at the time, Sali Berisha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ms Blair and Mrs Berisha became friends when her husband was still in Downing Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mrs Blair flew to the impoverished country in a private jet owned by Rezart Taci, a controversial oil tycoon, and one of Albania's richest men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Albania is just one of several countries advised by Mr Blair, through his company, Tony Blair Associates, which he set up on leaving Downing Street in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Blair has lucrative deals with Kazakhstan, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Mongolia among others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In Guinea, the strategy document with Mr Blair's advice provides insight into work undertaken by the former prime minister and his charity, Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), in advising the nation's president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mr Blair began working in Guinea in 2012, a year before violence gripped the country in the run-up to elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>His charity also advises Nigeria, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It has also agreed a deal to work in Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The strategy document for Guinea's "electoral situation" will raise questions about whether AGI has become too political by siding with the president and the ruling party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mr Blair has previously caused anger for advising Mr Nazarbayev on how to manage his image after the slaughter of unarmed civilians protesting against his regime in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In a letter to Mr Nazarbayev, Mr Blair told the Kazakh president the deaths of 14 protesters "tragic though they were, should not obscure the enormous progress" his country had made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mr Blair is paid millions of pounds through one of his companies to advise the Kazakh regime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mr Blair's involvement in Rwanda and his close friendship with Paul Kagame, the country's president, has also attracted much criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mr Kagame's regime has killed and tortured opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Mr Blair's work in Guinea is funded by donations to his charity and grants from taxpayer-funded bodies such as USAid, the aid arm of the US government.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine rebels insist heavy weapons withdrawn from front line</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Snizhne: Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine claim to have fulfilled their end of a February deal with government forces to withdraw heavy weapons from the front line as part of a ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Today is the last day of the weapons withdrawal," Eduard Basurin, one of the rebel leaders, told reporters in the town of Snizhne on Saturday, where the separatists displayed eight 120mm mortars that had been moved back from their positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Watched by six international monitors, who declined requests for comment, the separatists towed the arms to a disused brick factory serving as an arms depot, about 90 kilometres from the rebel hub of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A battered Ukrainian army helmet in Yenakievo, Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rebels claim they have withdrawn heavy weapons from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Basurin said the separatists were withdrawing a total of 26 mortars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They will be stored with the rest of the military hardware," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Four other artillery pieces were seen inside the Snizhne depot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A pro-Russian rebel cleans equipment at the weekend near the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Under the terms of the European-brokered, Russian-backed truce, signed in the Belarussian capital, Minsk, on February 12, both sides to Ukraine's 11-month conflict must move their artillery back far enough to create a buffer zone of between 50 kilometres and 140 kilometres, depending on the weapons' range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The process has been fraught with distrust and mutual recriminations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Both parties have accused the other of merely paying lip service to the peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Alexander Zakharchenko, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, accused Ukraine's government of failing to live up to its side of the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A trench near the front line in Horlivka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We have fully removed heavy weapons from the line of contact. Ukraine has not yet done it," he told the separatist news agency DAN, threatening to redeploy the arms if Kiev did not match the de-escalation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ukrainian army spokesman Anatoliy Stelmakh said the government was upholding its end of the bargain, saying the army was continuing to withdraw its 220mm Uragan rocket launchers from the conflict zone, after earlier pulling back its smaller Grad multiple rocket systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The process is ongoing," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The end of the nearly daily deluge of shelling and rocketing, which has killed more than 6000 people in eastern Ukraine since April 2014, would be a coup for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, architects of the Russian-backed ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is monitoring the truce, has recorded arms movements on both sides over the past two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>However, it said it was being denied access to the information it needed to confirm weapons were being put beyond use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After a blood-soaked start to the truce - as the rebels fought on to seize the transport hub of Debaltseve - eastern Ukraine regained a measure of peace in the past two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Beyond the heavy weapons, the deal also calls for the withdrawal "of all foreign-armed formations" and military equipment from Ukrainian territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The accord also commits Kiev and the rebels to exchange all prisoners and to negotiate a change to Ukraine's constitution by the end of 2015, in order to give rebel-held areas more autonomy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On Saturday, they again traded accusations of violating the ceasefire in the past 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But there was good news in Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"For the first time over the past few months" no Ukrainian soldier was killed or injured by rebel fire, a military spokesman said.</td></tr>
