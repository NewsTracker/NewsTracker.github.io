<h3>Google could put an end to international roaming fees</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google is reportedly in talks with several mobile networks that would allow travelers to use their phones abroad at no additional cost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Among the companies that Google is talking to is the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa, according to The Telegraph, which first reported the negotiations over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hutchison owns the mobile operator Three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>By teaming up with Hutchison, Google could gain access to mobile services in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy and several more countries where the Hong Kong conglomerate owns mobile networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It also operates in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Italy, Sweden, Denmark and Austria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A spokesperson for Google said the company did not comment on "rumors or speculation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A spokeswoman for Hutchison did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Roaming fees are one of the biggest headaches of traveling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Travelers are routinely hit with steep fees for calls, text messages and Internet data, unless they have an international plan that offers some relief or sign onto a local plan once they arrive at their destination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Reduced roaming fees have become a key marketing tool for carriers challenging larger incumbents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For example, T-Mobile offers some free international roaming benefits and has lured customers away from the top US carriers, AT&T and Verizon, according to CNET.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In March, Google said it would offer mobile phone network service this year through partnerships to use other operators' network infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Although Google's product chief Sundar Pichai said the service will be "smaller scale," it could unsettle the market by offering lower prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"When Google gets into this space, they are going to make things more competitive. They are going to put some pressure on Verizon and AT&T," CNET tech reporter Bridget Carey told CBS News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Carey said Google has the potential to rattle the mobile market as much as it has broadband service since it rolled out Google Fiber.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Now, you have AT&T and others offering high speed (Internet) at good prices," she said.</td></tr>
