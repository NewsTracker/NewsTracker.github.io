<h3>Scott Walker's parents' home swarmed by pro-union protesters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The protesters circled the home on 68th Street and called out, "Hey hey, ho ho, Scott Walker's got to go," "The students united will never be defeated," and "Students are not for sale," Wauwatosa Now reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shouting through a megaphone, Wisconsin Jobs Now Director Jennifer Epps-Addison justified the protest by arguing the governor's proposed cuts to education were invading their own homes, the newspaper reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wauwatosa Now reported that Mr. Walker lived at the home, but the governor's son, Matt, tweeted a correction: "'Protestors March on @ScottWalker's home' CORRECTION: protestors March on my grandparents home," he wrote, linking to the Wauwatosa Now report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"They're protesting out front of our home. Who lives there you might ask? My grandma & grandpa. Unbelievable," the Republican governor's other son, Alex, tweeted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The protest stemmed from $300 million in proposed cuts to the University of Wisconsin System.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A representative for Mr. Walker defended the proposed cuts, and said taxpayers will collectively see $150 million in annual savings, a local Fox affiliate reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The budget protects the state's commitment to K-12 schools by increasing equalization aids and other categorical aid programs, while at the same time reducing property taxes for the typical homeowner," Mr. Walker's office said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Our proposal gives the University of Wisconsin the tools to find savings through an authority while protecting Wisconsin's hard-working families and students by freezing tuition for another two years."</td></tr>
