<h3>EU to accuse Google of illegally abusing search</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The European Union is preparing to accuse Google of illegally abusing its dominance of search, according to a report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO - The European Union will accuse Google of illegally abusing its dominance of search in Europe, a person familiar with the situation said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google will be served with a statement of objections, essentially a formal charge sheet, on Wednesday, the person said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The EU is alleging the Internet giant broke antitrust regulations by siphoning traffic from its competitors to its own services, two people familiar with the case told the Financial Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This is the first volley in what could develop into the the major antitrust case of the Internet era.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Google could ultimately be forced to pay large fines or make significant changes to its business in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The EU has been investigating Google for five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Google nearly settled the case without any charges last year but the deal fell apart over objections from ministers in France and Germany and powerful tech groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A decision on the charges will be taken up by the college of 28 EU commissioners on Wednesday, the Financial Times said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A spokesman for the commission refused to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A Google spokeswoman declined to comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Technology news outlet Re/code obtained an internal memo in which Google calls the EU decision "very disappointing news."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Google expects the E.U. Commission for Competition to open up an investigation into Android on Wednesday, according to the memo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We have a very strong case," the memo says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Google critics applauded the filing of charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The European Commission's issuance of a Statement of Objections (SO) laying out specific charges against Google would represent a significant step towards ending Google's anti-competitive practices, which have harmed innovation and consumer choice," Thomas Vinje, Legal Counsel and Spokesman for FairSearch Europe, said in a written statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"FairSearch Europe awaits confirmation of Commission action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In a report earlier this month, S&P Capital IQ analyst Scott Kessler wrote: "Although we believe Google has been effective at fending off these accusations, we believe such a suit is closer than ever, and see it as a potential notable negative the company. However, we also think Google has some solid defenses and could prevail in court."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The development comes amid growing concern over the dominance of U.S. tech companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The European Union should regulate U.S. Internet giants to allow homegrown companies to become more competitive, the EU's digital commissioner said in a speech on Tuesday.</td></tr>
