<h3>The Daily Show?s Jon Stewart confronts The Daily Show?s Seth Rollins on WWE Monday Night Raw</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Stewart is a longtime WWE fan, seated ringside for past WWE shows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Monday, March 2, rather than watching, Stewart was the one being watched by the WWE Universe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Flanked by J&J Security (Joey Mercury and Jamie Noble) and with a mock set in the middle of the ring, Rollins was actually funny, ripping Stewart, but then the sarcastic Stewart appeared, turning the tables, so to speak, on an irate Rollins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>WWE superstar Randy Orton interrupted as Rollins prepared to demolish Stewart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>With the distraction, Stewart low-blowed Rollins using a left-footed kick, before sliding out of the ring and finding safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Last week, Rollins challenged Stewart to appear on Raw, and an intimidated Stewart eventually accepted the challenge, mustering just enough courage as his Feb. 26 show closed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Stewart playfully jumped Rollins from behind, before Mr. Money in the Bank reversed the 'attack' and put Stewart in a headlock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The confrontation stems from a social medial and TV battle between Rollins and Stewart that started earlier in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It's all part of the Road to Wrestlemania 31, which is Sunday, March 29 from Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara, Calif.</td></tr>

<h3>Bali nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to be transferred to Nusakambangan on Wednesday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be transferred to the execution island of Nusakambanganon on Wednesday, it has been announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Momock Bambang Samiarso, Bali's chief prosecutor and the man in charge of the transfer, made the announcement after meeting with police, military and other officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran with barrister Julian McMahon at Kerobokan Prison on what is the last visit before he is transferred to Nusakambangan prison island for upcoming execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The two Australians, reformed drug smugglers, are aware they will be moved, said Kerobokan prison governor Sudjonggo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said the duo had given some of their belongings to other members of the Bali nine syndicate and Sukumaran had told them to "be careful", or behave well, after he left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The duo will be allowed to bring personal belongings with them, but their families will not be able to visit them on Wednesday, as preparations for the move will restrict access, Sudjonggo told Fairfax Media earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A dismayed Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said it was callous for the executions to proceed given the men's rehabilitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Myuran Sukumaran, one of the Bali nine duo at Kerobokan Prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I will continue to contact counterpart ministers to press for a stay of execution," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Chan's brother Michael and Sukumaran's mother Raji visited the pair on Tuesday but left the penitentiary before news emerged of the timing of their transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Other family members are expected to come over from Australia soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Families will be able to visit the two men on Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>As Sudjonggo spoke, they were being comforted by their lawyer, Julian McMahon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The transfer will use two military transport planes, Mr Momock said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One will contain the Australians and their guards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The other will contain another contingent of security personnel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He said the transfer would occur on Wednesday "siang", or day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The phrase usually denotes a time between 10am and 3pm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Speaking later, Mr Mocock told reporters to "standby from the morning", meaning the transfer could happen even earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The men are expected to be transported to Denpasar airport from the prison in armoured personnel vans, most likely the police's Barracuda vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran can expect to be executed soon after the transfer, with Indonesia's attorney-general saying that the execution by firing squad of the two men and eight other drug felons will happen "ASAP".</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The men will be given 72 hours notice before they are killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>As well as their families, lawyers and a religious counsellor will be able to see them while on Nusakambangan, an island with a prison complex in Central Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Indonesian lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran have released a statement calling on the Attorney-General to refrain from executing the Australians or transferring them from Bali's Kerobokan jail while legal action is underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The statement said the men had challenged the dismissal to their appeal in the Jakarta State Administrative Court on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Secondly, they had submitted a report to the Judicial Commission on February 13 alleging violations of judicial conduct and ethics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>This was based on information obtained by the men's former lawyer, Muhammad Rifan, who alleged the judges who sentenced Chan and Sukumaran to death offered a lighter sentence in exchange for money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Indonesian criminal law basically guarantees the rights of convicts to defend their legal rights," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Due to the ongoing legal recourse by Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan it would therefore be appropriate if the Attorney-General's office respects such legal recourse by refraining from carrying out the execution of sentence against Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, including transferring them from Kerobokan prison to the prison at Nusakambangan."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Indonesia's attorney general Prasetyo said on Monday that legal appeals pending for Chan and Sukumaran would not have any impact on the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Because the drug smuggling duo had their clemency appeals rejected by Indonesian President Joko Widodo, he said, these later appeals were irrelevant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran reacted angrily to the remarks, saying Mr Prasetyo was not respecting the rule of law in the country and would bring international condemnation upon Indonesia by rushing through the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Mr Prasetyo revealed on Tuesday that prisons on Nusakambangan have requested that the Bali nine duo not spend too much time in isolation on the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Stating - as he did on Monday - that preparations were 95 per cent complete for the execution of 10 drug felons, Mr Prasetyo said an evaluation of the first batch of executions this year had shown there were things that needed to be improved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The execution of six drug felons on January 18 was hampered by weather problems, journalists masquerading as fishermen to try and access the island and confusion over the religion of those condemned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"We will immediately carry out the executions when the preparation is completed," Mr Prasetyo said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"The principle is that once they are there they should not wait too long in their cell."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>There were also still prisoners who needed to be transported from Madiun and Yogyakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>"After the evacuation we will determine the time of the execution," Mr Prasetyo said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Meanwhile, fellow prisoner on death row, Filipino Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso had her request for a judicial review into her case adjourned until Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The migrant worker was sentenced to death for smuggling 2.6 kilograms of heroin into Indonesia from Malaysia in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Indonesia plans to kill 10 drug felons in a mass execution that will require 120 members of a combined firing squad, 12 for each victim.</td></tr>
