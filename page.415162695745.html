<h3>911 dispatchers test working on treadmills</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>911 dispatchers test working on treadmills Emergency dispatchers in Oregon are testing the use of treadmills at their 911 call center, seeing if it helps with health and concentration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"At first it was kind of different," said John Mason, a dispatcher in Washington County, Ore., west of Portland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"But after a while of doing it, it just kind of feels like everything else."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dispatchers started using treadmills at their workstations on a voluntary-basis six months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The machines have a maximum speed of two miles per hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I don't think I've ever broken a sweat," said dispatcher Bill Jolley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"At two miles per hour, it's a pretty leisurely pace, but you do stay moving."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Oregon Health & Science University is conducting a study on the effects on reaction, mood and health of emergency call center employees using the treadmills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is too early to determine the results of the study said Dr. Kent Anger of OHSU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There's a growing number of health studies that point to the danger of sitting too long at a stretch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some companies provide standing desks for their cubicle-bound workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In Oregon, several dispatchers said they started feeling better after using the treadmills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some lost weight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dispatchers said the exercise helped with concentration, awareness and relieved stress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Obviously you are working but you feel like you kind of worked out in a sense," said dispatcher Katie Fischer, who'd logged just under 10 miles in one shift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The dispatchers explained that walking on a treadmill doesn't interrupt emergency calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They have the ability to stop the equipment at any given time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The biggest concern for one dispatcher is the potential embarrassment of a misstep.</td></tr>
