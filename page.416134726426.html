<h3>Apple Watch pre-orders begin, luxury US$17K gold model sells out in China in under an hour</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Do you need to buy the Apple Watch?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the early days, when Apple's Watch was no more than a rumour, there wasn't a lot of choice in the smartwatch market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With Apple's Watch finally to be released, pre-ordering starting April 10 and watches to be on store shelves - or on consumer wrists - from April 24, now is the time to ask yourself: Do you need the Apple Watch to change your life?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Apple Watch, CEO Tim Cook's first new major product and the company's first foray into the personal luxury goods market, was available for pre-order online and to try out in stores - but not to take home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On April 24, consumers will be able to buy it online or by appointment in shops including trendy fashion boutiques in Paris, London and Tokyo, part of Apple's strategy of positioning the wearable computer as a must-have accessory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Testing Apple's mastery of consumer trends, the watch is an untried concept for the California-based company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It straddles a technology market accustomed to rapid obsolescence and luxury goods whose appeal lies in their enduring value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Apple Watch sport starts at US$349 while the standard version comes in at US$549 in the U.S. High-end "Edition" watches with 18-karat gold alloys are priced from US$10,000 and go as high as US$17,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>China was among countries where the watch had its global debut Friday, reflecting the country's fast-growing status as one of Apple's most important markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to a Business Insider report, the "Edition" watch has already sold out in the country, with the pricey gold model going out of stock in under an hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In central Shanghai, potential Apple watch buyers stood in lines two to five people long over their lunch hour at an Apple store on Friday to try on the watch many said they already planned to buy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It was beautifully made, like an expensive watch," said Li Hao, 27, a Web designer who owns a Mac, an iPad and an Apple TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He has just traded up from an iPhone 4 to the new iPhone 6 Plus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Li said he planned to buy the sport version of the watch at about 3,000 yuan ($500).</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I cannot do sports with the mobile phone," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I need a machine to record what I did and a screen to look at."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Qi Tian, 26, who works in human resources for a real estate company, said he was "not a big fan" of Apple, though he owns four or five products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He said he planned to order a watch online that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I just came to see if the size fits," said Qi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Before the Paris Apple store opened, about 100 people were queuing outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Staff cheered and applauded the first customers, most of them men aged under 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I have everything from Apple so now I need to get the watch," said 19-year-old Jeremy Dugue, who was sporting an Armani leather jacket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Within the first hour in Paris, many customers had pre-ordered their watch, and several went for the entry-level model with a black plastic bracelet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>High demand means some shoppers in Paris will have to wait 4-6 weeks before their watch arrives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"It was comfortable, I didn't think it would be that comfortable. It's an easy way of managing your busy life," said 19-year old student Omar Alborno, one of the first to try on the watch at London's luxury Selfridges department store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Earlier on Friday, Apple's flagship store in Sydney's financial district was packed with those hoping to get the first peek at the device, although just around 20 die-hard fans queued out front, modest by the standards of a major Apple launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Based on recent customer interest at its stores, Apple expects demand for the watch, which allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls when paired with an iPhone, to exceed availability at launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Reviewers this week praised the watch, which also helps users monitor their health and exercise, as "beautiful" and "stylish" but gave it poor marks for relatively low battery life and slow-loading apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Sales estimates for 2015 vary widely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Piper Jaffray predicts 8 million units and Global Securities Research forecasts 40 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>By comparison, Apple sold nearly 200 million iPhones last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Apple's watch is widely expected to outsell those by Samsung, Sony Corp and Fitbit, that have attracted modest interest from consumers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It will likely account for 55% of global smartwatch shipments this year, according to Societe Generale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"Apple will outsell its wearable rivals by a very wide margin but it will do this on the power of its brand and its design alone," independent technology analyst Richard Windsor said.</td></tr>
