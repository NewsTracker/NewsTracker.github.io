<h3>Bali nine pair Chan and Myuran the 'nice criminals' facing the firing squad</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In this 2013 interview, he explains how he pursued redemption through art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A few weeks before the devastating news that his clemency bid had been rejected by the Indonesian president, Myuran Sukumaran made contact with this reporter through back channels with a request: could Fairfax Media please stop using a particular photograph of him and fellow death row convict Andrew Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The photograph of the pair, shaved heads, arms crossed, Chan in sunglasses and bristling with testosterone, is one of the few in recent times that depicts them together, so it has become a constant feature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But, he said, it upset his mum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Andrew Chan arrives at Cilacap airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"She said that the pic makes us look like mean criminals, when actually we're very nice criminals!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Sukumaran's message said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nice criminals is how both young men turned out after almost a decade living in Kerobokan prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Their rehabilitation - as genuine as it is remarkable - is the defining feature of their time on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But mean criminals is how they started out, and what they were sentenced for in 2006 - Chan as the "Godfather" of the Bali nine syndicate, and Sukumaran as the "Enforcer".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Executions delayed: Myuran Sukumaran arrives at Cilacap airport en route to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The shadow cast by those descriptions is likely in the next few days to claim their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sukumaran was born in London in 1981 to Sri Lankan parents, and Chan in Sydney in January 1984 to Cantonese-speaking Chinese parents, but both grew up in the melting pot of western Sydney and were students at Homebush Boy's High School.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Chan was always described by schoolmates, and by his little "gang" of intensely loyal friends on the streets of western Sydney, as a trickster, a joker, always ready with a quip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Others described him as a bully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He described himself as the "black sheep" of his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>After leaving school, he worked as a casual food runner for Eurest, the caterer at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where he met a number of other of the Bali nine runners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He was just 21 when he was apprehended in April 2005, but had already made two smuggling trips to Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Even so, he still lived at home - something he laughed about later when described as the "godfather".</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Sukumaran was the eldest of three, and after leaving school, worked as a mail-room clerk at a finance company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>While Chan was quick-witted and brazen, Sukumaran was quiet and reserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A school reference, written by his principal a few years before described the boy known even then as Myu, as "a charming young man, always polite and courteous and takes great pride in his appearance".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Police surveillance in Bali showed that, between them, Chan and Sukumaran were the key figures on the ground in Bali during the operation to intercept the 8.3 kilograms of drugs from the Golden Triangle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Chan met and collected the drugs from Cherry Likit Bannakorn, the never-apprehended courier who brought the drugs from Thailand to Denpasar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Chan was the one who had organised the flights, accommodation and mobile phones of the other members of the nine, and he was the one who bought the baggy floral shirts the couriers were dressed in to hide their drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>At pretty much every step of the way, Sukumaran was with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He was the only one of the nine whose names were not known to the Australian Federal Police when they tipped off the Bali police, and in Bali, they referred to him as "the black one," or "the negro".</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>They believed he was Chan's bodyguard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>On April 17, 2005, Chan was caught already on a flight to Sydney, and Sukumaran was caught with a number of others in a hotel room and a suitcase full of drug paraphernalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But more than these facts, what really sealed their fates - apart from the alleged unwillingness to bribe the prosecutor and judges - was the testimony of the mules that they were the bosses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Chan was particularly pinpointed as having allegedly threatened to kill their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Making it worse was that neither Chan nor Sukumaran would admit to anything or express remorse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Chan's evidence was internally contradictory and laughable; Sukumaran simply gave none.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>At one point he claimed to have suffered amnesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In a legal system where expressions of remorse and guilt are taken very seriously, both men flouted the convention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Of the nine, six received life sentences, Renae Lawrence received 20 years, and they were given death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The sentence survived every appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Still neither man has identified who were the real big fish in their syndicate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Sukumaran said this was to safeguard his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>His request about our "mean criminals" photograph suggests that protecting his mum still important to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Their rehabilitation, though - their transformation into "nice criminals" - is genuine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Chan's religious conversion, counselling and activity in the church is well known inside prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>In the shadow of his own death, he was ordained as a pastor and many young Indonesian prisoners testify that he has saved their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>He remains a joker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Sukumaran not only learnt art, but set up a number of workshops and educational rooms, forging a creative hub in the middle of a tough, drug and gang-riddled prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>In a February, 2013 interview, Sukumaran told Fairfax Media that art was something to focus on, a way to work through his problems, but more importantly: "To find out who I am, where I fit in the world, how I can contribute to the world. Not just through my painting, but [through] building workshops. That's also sort of like art, yeah? That's what I think."</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Towards the end, as the death sentence began to weigh heavier, according to Melbourne artist Matthew Sleeth, who visited him regularly, it had become something else, too: "A tool to stay sane during what can only be described as torture".</td></tr>
