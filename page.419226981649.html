<tr><td>6</td><td>It will include companies "that are pretty far afield" from the main Internet products, like Calico, the life sciences effort; the Google Capital and Google Ventures investment arms, and Google X, the company's big-thinking lab that's working on things like self-driving cars and drones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shares of Alphabet - to keep things simple or to make them more confusing, depending on your viewpoint - will still trade under the letters GOOG and GOOGL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The rethinking of the Mountain View, Calif. company acknowledges what many big tech companies are today - a collection of products and services, some wildly profitable, some not, gathered under one roof.</td></tr>
