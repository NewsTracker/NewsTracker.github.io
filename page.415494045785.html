<h3>Cyclone Pam: Is it time for a category-6 cyclone rating?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cyclone Pam left debris scattered across Port Vila with residents now beginning the massive clean-up effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The unusual strength of Cyclone Pam, which devastated Vanuatu over the weekend, may stir debate about the need for a category-6 rating for storms to reflect their increasing severity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jonathan Nott, a professor at James Cook University and expert on cyclone history, said there has "been a lot of discussion over the last five to 10 years" about the need to extend the cyclone severity rating beyond the current maximum of five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Everyone's been asking this question: should we have a cat-6 or not?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Professor Nott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Residents stand near a bridge damaged by Cyclone Pam near Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>According to the New Zealand's MetService, satellites indicate Cyclone Pam reached mean wind speeds of 270 km/h, with gusts even higher as it passed over the Pacific island nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Low pressure at the eye of the storm, rated a category-5 "super cyclone", dipped as low as 890 hectopascals (hPa), said Emma Blades, a meteorologist with the service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Cyclone Pam was "certainly one of the biggest storms to occur in the South Pacific", Kevin Walsh, an associate professor at Melbourne University, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's extremely rare for us to get tropical cyclones with central pressures in the South Pacific less than 900 hPa."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A University of South Pacific sign bent by the ferocity of Cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Australia's Bureau of Meteorology lists category-5 as its highest severity for a tropical cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>To warrant such a rating, maximum mean wind speeds must top 200 km/h with a central pressure of less than 930 hPA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Based on the differences between category-3 and -4 cyclones, a category-6 cyclone would signal mean wind speeds of about 240 km/h or stronger, with a central pressure of less than 915 hPa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Cyclone Pam may have exceeded both measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>However, Blair Trewin, a senior bureau climatologist, said there was no plan for the agency to extend its cyclone categories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The eye of Cyclone Pam as it passes over Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meteorologists typically infer wind strength and pressure from analysis of satellite images of clouds and the shape of the eye of the storm, rather than direct measurement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Engineers also examine damage in the wake of the event, such as signs buckled by the winds, to estimate a storm's ferocity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The physical processes that lead to a cyclone forming also tend to limit its intensity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Storms draw their strength from warm sea-surface temperatures, but the resulting churn of the waters and accompanying rain helps to cool conditions, particularly if the cyclone is relatively stationary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Similarly, the faster the winds of cyclone spin, the more friction they produce, particularly when the storm makes landfall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Ultimately, the amount of energy lost through friction from wind speeds starts to become greater than the energy gained from evaporation and condensation," Professor Nott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>However, there is evidence that climate change will increase the maximum potential intensity of cyclonic events by increasing the warmth available to be tapped from the oceans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"That will be one factor that will allow cyclones to become more intense in the future," Professor Nott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Another issue is that the tropical region where cyclones can form is expanding north and south of the equator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We've got evidence already that this is happening," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A decade ago, US scientists began discussing whether the Atlantic hurricane gauge needed to be extended beyond its top category, also a five, after a season of particularly strong events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Maybe with the increasing frequency of these extreme events, there will be a more lively discussion of whether we should have a cat-6 or not," Professor Nott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In the case of Cyclone Pam, Professor Nott said the worst of the storm missed Port Vila, with islands to the south, such as Erromango, likely to have received a direct hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"It may well have had full-on high cat-5 conditions," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"In a category-5 cyclone there aren't any leaves left on the trees and the trees themselves are not standing."</td></tr>
