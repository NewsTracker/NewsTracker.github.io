<h3>Mexico brothers lose final death sentence appeal in Malaysia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) " Three Mexican brothers and two other people on Thursday lost their final appeals against death sentences for drug trafficking in Malaysia, their lawyer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Mexicans are from Sinaloa state, the cradle of their country's drug trade, but have no criminal record at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They were arrested at a secluded drug-making factory in Malaysia in 2008, and claimed they had been cleaning the place, not making drugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Their lawyer Kitson Foong said a five-man bench in the Federal Court, Malaysia's highest court, unanimously rejected their appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The defense has argued that the evidence was tampered with, but the judges said that they were satisfied the men were guilty, Foong said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The brothers " Jose Regino Gonzales, 37, Simon, 40, and Luis Alfonso, 47 " were sentenced to death in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The other two were Singaporean Lim Hung Wang and Malaysian Lee Boon Siah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Foong said the brothers may seek a judicial review of the court's decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Drug trafficking carries a mandatory death by hanging in Malaysia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The lower courts had previously rejected the defense's contention that some evidence discrepancies amounted to tampering after a chemist testified that seven items he received for analysis looked different from what he had seen at the drug factory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The prosecution denied there was any manipulation and said that traces of drug chemicals were found on the men's clothes and stains on their underwear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At the factory where the men were arrested, police found more than 29 kilograms (63 pounds) of methamphetamine worth 44 million ringgit ($12 million).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The men are the first Mexicans arrested in Malaysia on drug trafficking charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They worked making and selling bricks in Mexico, and their family said they left for a job opportunity abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Relatives and neighbors insist there was no sign they were involved in the drug trade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Malaysia's government says it has hanged more than 440 people in the past 50 years, many of them for drug crimes, while some 900 are on death row.</td></tr>
