<h3>Clinton used private email for State Department business</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington: Hillary Clinton exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state, State Department officials have said, and may have violated federal requirements that officials' correspondence be retained as part of the agency's record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mrs Clinton did not have a government email address during her four-year tenure at the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Her aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as is required by the Federal Records Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A spokesman for Mrs Clinton, Nick Merrill, defended her use of a personal email account and said she has been complying with the "letter and spirit of the rules".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But those who have accused her of concealing key details of the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi which killed four Americans, including the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, are likely to seize upon this controversy involving the woman widely assumed to be the Democratic Party's frontrunner for the 2016 presidential nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was only two months ago, in response to a new State Department effort to comply with federal record-keeping practices, that Mrs Clinton's advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails and decided which ones to turn over to the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>All told, 55,000 pages of emails were given to the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mrs Clinton stepped down from the post of top US diplomat in early 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Her expansive use of the private account was alarming to current and former National Archives and Records Administration officials and government watchdogs, who called it a serious breach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario - short of nuclear winter - where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business," said Jason Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>When Mrs Clinton first took the secretary of state's job in early 2009, Washington was still digesting a major controversy over Bush administration officials using personal email addresses to conduct government business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In June 2007 a congressional oversight committee had asked the Bush administration for emails related to the sacking of US attorneys, allegedly for political reasons, but it turned out the administration had conducted millions of emails' worth of business on private addresses and that the archives had been deleted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Oversight committee chairman Henry Waxman accused the Bush administration of "using non-governmental accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of the communications".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mrs Clinton is not the first government official - or first secretary of state - to use a personal email account on which to conduct official business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But her exclusive use of her private email, for all of her work, appears unusual, Mr Baron said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even the Bush administration officials involved in the attorneys scandal used their official addresses as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I can recall no instance in my time at the National Archives when a high-ranking official at an executive branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business," said Mr Baron, who worked at the agency from 2000 to 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Merrill declined to detail why Mrs Clinton had chosen to conduct State Department business from her personal account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mrs Clinton's successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, has used a government email account since taking over the role, and his correspondence is being preserved contemporaneously as part of State Department records, according to his aides.</td></tr>

<h3>Barclays profits soar 12% to ?5.5bn</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Chief executive Antony Jenkins said the group was stronger than at any time since the financial crisis as it announced a 12% rise in adjusted pre-tax profits to 5.5 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the lender's latest forex provision took its total exposure to the affair so far to 1.25 billion while it also added 200 million to provide for the ongoing compensation programme for customers mis-sold payment protection insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The level of bonuses paid by the bank fell 22% to 1.86 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Jenkins said: "Barclays today is a stronger business, with better prospects, than at any time since the financial crisis."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Jenkins is taking his first annual bonus since becoming chief executive in 2012 - of 1.1 million - after declining the previous two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Together with long-term awards and other remuneration it takes his total 2014 package to 5.5 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The sum is likely to cause controversy following a year in which Barclays has axed 14,000 jobs and closed a net 72 branches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Statutory annual profits at the bank were down 21% after taking hits including those for the forex scandal and PPI as well as a 446 million loss on the sale of Barclays' Spanish business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Jenkins said: "While our work in transforming the bank is not complete, our performance in 2014 gives us confidence that we are on the right track."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Barclay's investment bank, which is being shrunk under plans to transform the group, saw profits fall 32% to 1.38 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Finance director Tushar Morzaria said: "Although there remains uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, which is expected to persist through the year, we believe there will be greater clarity on regulatory requirements and several conduct issues during 2015."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Barclays did not enter into the settlements last November which saw six banks fined 2.6 billion over forex rigging by global regulators including the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It said it was seeking a "more general co-ordinated settlement" - with other authorities in the US still investigating the scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Barclays said it is reviewing its foreign exchange trading over a several-year period and continuing to co-operate with relevant bodies, and that these probes could result in "substantial monetary penalties".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Meanwhile, the bank said profits at its personal and corporate banking arm rose 29% to 2.88 billion, driven by income from personal accounts as well as lower bad loan impairments amid the improving UK economy.</td></tr>
