<h3>'Suge' Knight taken to hospital after ruling in murder case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Knight's condition and the cause of his latest health problem were not immediately known, but it was the fifth time the Death Row Records co-founder had been taken from a courthouse to a hospital during proceedings in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The latest trip came after Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen rejected Knight's argument that he acted in self-defense when he was viciously attacked by men outside a Compton burger stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>FILE - In this March 9, 2015 file photo, Marion "Suge" Knight, center, arrives in court for a hearing about evidence in his murder case, in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Knight will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges after the former rap music mogul struck two men with his pickup truck in January, killing one and seriously injuring the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen made the ruling Thursday after concluding a hearing that focused heavily on testimony from Cle "Bone" Sloan, who was hit outside a Compton burger stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The judge also reduced bail from $25 million to $10 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Authorities contend Knight intentionally hit the men, killing Terry Carter, 55, and injuring Cle "Bone" Sloan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Knight's attorney Matt Fletcher argued that his client was ambushed and was trying to escape from Sloan when Knight ran down the men in the attack captured on security video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There's no intent to kill," Fletcher said in court while asking the judge to dismiss the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There's an intent to survive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Coen, however, said it appeared Knight, 49, wasn't attempting to flee but instead trying to kill someone when he accelerated forward in the truck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The judge did throw out one of two hit-and-run counts, saying the charge applies to one event even if there are multiple victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He also reduced bail from $25 million to $10 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Knight appeared to be OK as he looked at members of his family in the gallery and shuffled out of the courtroom in ankle shackles and handcuffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was later taken to the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Knight has diabetes and a blood clot near his lung, his lawyer previously said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Before word of his hospitalization was public, his fiancee, Toi Kelly, said outside court that Knight's health had been improving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Fletcher said Thursday evening that he did not have any information about his client's health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The ruling came at the end of a hearing that focused heavily on testimony from Sloan, a former gang member who told detectives he attacked Knight before getting run over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Sloan said he didn't remember the fight and did not want to be a snitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Prosecutors played a statement by Sloan to police that offered a lucid, detailed account of the events on Jan. 29 that led to the deadly encounter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Sloan's testimony demonstrated the difficulty in prosecuting Knight, who has gang ties and a reputation for intimidating witnesses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I will not be used to send Suge Knight to prison," Sloan testified, adding that he was on the witness stand only because he was subpoenaed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He has known Knight for decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Prosecutors granted Sloan immunity from prosecution after he said he intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Knight was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Sloan, an adviser on the upcoming film "Straight Outta Compton" about rap music, testified that he was trying not to think about the crash in which he suffered two fractured ankles, a serious cut to his head, two torn knee ligaments and a shoulder injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"Every day, I try to forget it," Sloan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"I just know, I screwed up, and Terry's dead."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The judge also heard from the lead detective in the case and watched the security footage of the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The camera caught a limited view of the parking lot, but it shows Knight struggling with Sloan through the window of the truck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Knight then put the vehicle in reverse, striking Sloan twice before running over Carter while fleeing the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes said Knight gave up his right to claim self-defense when he used his car as a deadly weapon in response to a fistfight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Knight could face life in prison if convicted in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He has prior felony convictions for armed robbery and assault with a gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Knight pleaded no contest in a 1995 assault on two rap entertainers and was sentenced to five years' probation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He was sentenced to prison in February 1997 for violating terms of the probation by taking part in a fight at a Las Vegas hotel hours before Shakur was fatally wounded in a drive-by attack as he rode in Knight's car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Shakur's slaying remains unsolved.</td></tr>
