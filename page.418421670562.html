<h3>Omar Sharif, of &quot;Doctor Zhivago,&quot; &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; dies</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) " In "Lawrence of Arabia," Omar Sharif is first seen in the distance, a speck in the swirling desert sand. As he draws closer, he emerges first as a black figure on a galloping camel, slowly transforming into a handsome, dark-eyed figure with a gap-tooth smile. It wasn't unlike the Egyptian-born actor's debut in Hollywood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sharif was Egypt's biggest box-office star when David Lean cast him in 1962's "Lawrence of Arabia," but he was a virtual unknown elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He wasn't even the director's first choice to play Sherif Ali, the tribal leader with whom the enigmatic T.E. Lawrence teams up to help lead the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Lean had hired another actor but dropped him because his eyes weren't the right color.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The film's producer, Sam Spiegel, went to Cairo to search for a replacement and found Sharif, already a heartthrob in his own country playing brooding romantic heroes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>After passing a screen test that proved he was fluent in English, he got the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The film brought him a supporting-actor Oscar nomination and international stardom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Three years later, Sharif demonstrated his versatility, playing the leading role of a doctor-poet who endures decades of Russian history, including World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, surviving on his art and his eternal love of Lara, in "Dr. Zhivago."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lean's adaptation of the Boris Pasternak novel had a rocky beginning in its first U.S. release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Attendance was sparse and reviews were negative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After MGM removed it from theaters and Lean re-edited the sprawling tale, it was re-released and became a box-office hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Still, Sharif never thought it was as good as it could have been.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's sentimental. Too much of that music," he once said, referring to Maurice Jarre's luscious Oscar-winning score.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Although Sharif never achieved that level of success again, he remained a sought-after actor for many years, partly because of his proficiency at playing different nationalities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He was Argentine-born revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara in "Che!", Italian Marco Polo in "Marco the Magnificent" and Mongol leader Genghis Khan in "Genghis Khan."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He was a German officer in "The Night of the Generals," an Austrian prince in "Mayerling" and a Mexican outlaw in "Mackenna's Gold."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He was also the Jewish gambler Nick Arnstein opposite Barbra Streisand's Fanny Brice in "Funny Girl."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The 1968 film was banned in his native Egypt because he was cast as a Jew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In his middle years Sharif began appearing in such films as "The Pink Panther Strikes Again," ''Oh Heavenly Dog!," ''The Baltimore Bullet" and others he dismissed as "rubbish."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The drought lasted so long that finally, beginning in the late 1990s, Sharif began declining all film offers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I lost my self-respect and dignity," he told a reporter in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In 2003 he accepted a role in the French film "Monsieur Ibrahim," portraying a Muslim shopkeeper in Paris who adopts a Jewish boy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The role won him the Cesar, the French equivalent of the Oscar, and he followed with "Hidalgo," a lively western starring Viggo Mortensen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In that one he was a desert sheikh who duels 11 assailants with a sword.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>His career was back on track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Born Michael Shalhoub in Egypt's Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria, Sharif was the son of Christian Syrian-Lebanese parents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>After working three years at his father's lumber company, he fulfilled his longtime ambition to become a movie actor, going on to appear in nearly two dozen Egyptian films under the name Omar el Sharif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>His fame only increased when he married Egypt's then-reining movie queen and screen beauty, Faten Hamama, in 1955.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Some of Egypt's most iconic film posters are of Hamama and Sharif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Sharif converted to Islam to marry her, and they had a son, Tarek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Hamama died in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>They divorced in 1974, and Sharif never remarried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In a 2003 interview with the AP, Sharif struck a wistful note about how "Lawrence of Arabia" vaulted him to fame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"It separated me from my wife, from my family ... We didn't see each other anymore and that was it, the end of our wedding," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"I might have been happier having stayed an Egyptian film star."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Yousra, Egypt's biggest actress for much of the past 30 years and a close friend of Sharif, compared Sharif to a "clean-cut" diamond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"He was a phenomena; a one of a kind. Everyone had a dream to be like Omar Sharif. No one will be like him," she told the AP on Friday after his death was announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"I don't think we are going to ever have someone like him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Sharif's son Tarek revealed in May that his father had been suffering Alzheimer's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Zaki, the Egyptian Theatrical Arts Guild president, told the AP Friday that Sharif had stopped eating and drinking in the last three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Sharif was romantically linked with a number of Hollywood co-stars over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In 2004, he acknowledged that he also had another son, who was born after a one-night stand with an interviewer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Away from the movies, Sharif was a world-class bridge player who for many years wrote a newspaper column on bridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>He quit the game in later years, however, when he gave up gambling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>He had been a prodigious gambler, reportedly once winning a million dollars at an Italian casino.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>After losing a substantial amount at a Paris casino in 2003, he insulted a croupier and was ordered to leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>When he refused, he was thrown out and head-butted a policeman during an ensuing scuffle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>He was fined $1,700 and given a one-month suspended sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Sharif spent much of his later years in Cairo and at the Royal Moncean Hotel in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"When you live alone and you're not young, it's good to live in a hotel," he told a reporter in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"If you feel lonely, you can go down to the bar. I know all the people who work here and who come here regularly. The room is done for you, and you don't have to worry about anything," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>"If you feel anything, health-wise, you can call the concierge and tell them to bring all the ambulances in Paris."</td></tr>
