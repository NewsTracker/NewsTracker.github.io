<tr><td>27</td><td>German intelligence had repeatedly warned of the risk to aviation security and had assessed the downing of the Ukrainian military plane on July 14 as a 'significant development because of its altitude', German public TV channels NDR and WDR and Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Earlier this month, the Dutch government - which lost 192 citizens in the disaster - said that, with nearly all of the victims identified, efforts had shifted to finding those responsible for shooting the plane down as it flew over Ukraine last July.</td></tr>
