<h3>Mother of 2 suspects in Nemtsov killing in Russia says 'I didn't bring them up for this'</h3>

<tr><td>7</td><td>"No, Anzor, don't do it, I don't want this for you, I don't want you always to be afraid for your life," Zulai Gubasheva said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"And he said: 'OK, Mom. Mom, I asked and you told me your opinion."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She said he then left to rejoin his brother in the Russian capital.</td></tr>
