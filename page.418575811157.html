<h3>New footage emerges of MH17 crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>New video footage apparently showing Russian-backed rebels arriving at the site of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash highlights the incident was in no way an accident, Tony Abbott believes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The footage - which was reportedly filmed by the rebels themselves and released exclusively by News Corp - allegedly shows the insurgents' dismay as they discover what they thought was a Ukrainian jet fighter is a commercial airliner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It also shows the rebels rifling through the luggage of passengers and crew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The prime minister said the new footage highlighted the enormity of what happened a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"They may not have known that they were shooting down a civilian passenger plane, but they were deliberately shooting out of the sky what they knew was a large aircraft," Mr Abbott told ABC TV on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There was a reckless indifference, if you like, to where that missile was going."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said that plainly rebels didn't get hold of that kind of sophisticated weaponry by accident and Australia was confident the missiles had been brought across the border from Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Australia is involved in a five-country independent criminal investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The final report into the disaster is due to be released in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has joined Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine in asking the United Nations Security Council to establish an international criminal tribunal to try those responsible for crimes connected to the plane's downing once investigations are over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>She said on Friday the new video, which was yet to be verified, only added to her determination to ensure those responsible were held to account.</td></tr>
