<h3>Buffett, Munger both say euro is flawed and needs changes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Billionaires Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger both agree that the euro needs to be reformed if it is going to survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Berkshire Hathaway shareholders asked Buffett and Munger about the euro at Saturday's annual meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Buffett says the European currency is struggling because the countries that back it didn't agree to unify their monetary policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Bufffett says he thinks the euro will likely be saved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Munger says part of the problem is that some of the wrong countries were allowed to join the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He compared it to the poor prospects of starting a business with your "drunken, shiftless brother-in-law."</td></tr>
