<h3>Caught in the middle: War in Ukraine creates no man's lands</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FOR STORY UKRAINE NO MAN'S LANDS - In this photo taken on Thursday, June 11, 2015, a boy rides a bicycle past the sign reading "Severodonetsk" in the town of Severodonetsk, Luhansk region, eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Pro-Russian sympathies have historically been strong in a region where Ukrainian identity has tended to be much weaker than elsewhere in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>KATERYNIVKA, Ukraine (AP) - A single crack of an automatic rifle shattered the tomb-like silence of this no-man's-land village in east Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The gunshot, fired in error by a jumpy soldier, sent government border guard troops on patrol this week scrambling to brace against the ambush they expect every time they venture into Katerynivka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The men said that four of their fellow soldiers were killed in a recent clash with separatist rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Katerynivka is nominally the territory of Ukraine, but for the time being it is just a buffer zone where there could be bandits and separatist militants," said Pavlo Petrovich, known to fellow soldiers by the code-name Papa, a border guard service volunteer from the western region of Chernivtsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>What Ukrainian troops call a buffer zone is a village of a few hundred people stretched along a corrugated dead-end country lane hemmed in by heaving trees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Most of the young, fit and able have long left, as one nervous resident explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I lived here with a son, a daughter-in-law and their child," said Pyotr Vladimirovich, dabbing sweat from his sun-roasted brow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I am the only one left. I can't just abandon everything."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>For groceries, residents venture to the village shop, which remains open only until lunch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I just take care of the property, there's nothing else to do," said Vladimirovich, who worked as a bus driver before war broke out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The sound of shelling begins as dusk nears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Katerynivka has been spared much direct damage and the projectiles largely whistle over to fall closer to Ukrainian positions a few minutes up the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Still, venturing around the village is fraught with risks and any false step is potentially life-threatening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Over the weekend, a local 54-year old cowherd was hospitalized with grievous shrapnel wounds after setting off a tripwire while leading his animals to graze.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The homemade explosive device was made with a coil from a spring mattress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Ukrainian soldiers say it was laid by rebels, some of whom they say are likely from the village.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Most of the healthy male population is fighting on the side the LPR," said Papa, using the initials of the self-styled breakaway Luhansk People's Republic movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"They remain in communication with their families and sometimes carry out attacks on our checkpoints."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Until a few weeks ago, people could travel to and from separatist areas by driving along road running past the turnoff to Katerynivka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Soldiers guarding the way now turn back all traffic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>As the 450-kilometer (280-mile) line separating government and rebel territory began to evolve into a fixed feature last year, Ukrainian authorities created an unwieldy system of permits for movement from one zone into the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>With fighting surging again near the main separatist stronghold, only one of the corridors has been left open in the two separatism-plagued regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Things are arguably harder in Luhansk region, where the irascible governor, Hennadiy Moskal, has decreed that no civilians are any longer allowed to travel between government and rebel-controlled areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Why should I let people go through, just so they can get fired at with grenade-launchers and machine guns?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Moskal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"I have responsibilities before the president, the government and the people of Ukraine to preserve lives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>As the eponymous regional capital of Luhansk is held by separatists, Moskal is forced to run his office out of the relative backwater of Severodonetsk, where livelihoods have revolved since Soviet times around the local chemical factories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Only 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the front line, the town is blissfully somnolent and thoughts of war appear distant.</td></tr>
