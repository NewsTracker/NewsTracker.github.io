<h3>Artists to NYPD: Return Edward Snowden bust we put in park</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The artists are applying for permission to show parkgoers their likeness of the former National Security Agency secret-leaker, their lawyer, Ronald Kuby, told police in a letter Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In the meantime, a Manhattan gallery wants to show the sculpture next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We feel the piece would offer a great deal of good" and reflect the city's history as a home for free thinkers if exhibited through a temporary art-in-parks program, the artists - who have kept their identity secret - said in a statement Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police said they're holding the sculpture while investigating its unauthorized, dark-of-night appearance April 6 in Fort Greene Park; it was removed within hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Deputy Chief Kim Royster wouldn't comment on the status of the probe but noted that police may return confiscated property after investigations conclude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 4-foot-high, 100-pound, fiberglass-reinforced cement bust of Snowden, who is living in exile in Russia after divulging secret U.S. government collection of phone records, turned up on a monument that honors American captives who died on British prison ships during the Revolutionary War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The three artists say they considered the bust "a gift to the city" that could spur discussion about American ideals, values and heroes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Parks officials and police didn't see it that way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The object was erected in the park without permission or authority," Royster said in an email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The city Parks Department didn't respond to a request for comment on the artists' bid for permission to display the sculpture in future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Parks activist Geoffrey Croft feels the bust deserves a place in the city's public space, regardless how viewers may feel about Snowden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"New York City has a long, storied history of art and dissention," said Croft, who heads NYC Parks Advocates, a nonprofit group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>After all, the "Charging Bull" statue that has now become a symbol of Wall Street was an artist's surprise, deposited overnight outside the New York Stock Exchange in 1989.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>City officials ultimately accepted it and installed it nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For now, downtown Manhattan gallery Postmasters hopes to show the Snowden bust next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's a very interesting effort and gesture," both in its subject and its unauthorized unveiling, said co-founder Magdalena Sawon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She doesn't know who the artists are, she said.</td></tr>
