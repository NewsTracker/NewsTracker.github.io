<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Eurozone companies created jobs at the fastest pace in four years last month, according to an influential survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Employment rose for the seventh straight month in May, the survey from research firm Markit found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, it also indicated that economic growth in the eurozone's private sector lost steam last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Markit's purchasing managers' index (PMI) dipped to 53.6 in May from 53.9 in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A figure above 50 indicates growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Markit said that job creation accelerated last month in Germany, France and Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Job growth in Spain hit its fastest rate for more than seven years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, the survey also showed rates of expansion in other areas slowing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The eurozone recovery lost some of the wind from its sails in May, with growth of output and new orders both slowing to three-month lows," said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.</td></tr>
