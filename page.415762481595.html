<h3>Hundreds of One Direction fans want time off work to grieve</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of die-hard English One Directioners, as they so lovingly donned themselves, called into law agency offices Thursday morning asking if they could legally take a "compassionate day" to deal with the overbearing sadness they're enduring over Zayn Malik leaving the band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Compassionate days are usually given to coworkers after a death in the family has occurred or a period of extreme grievance is needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Usually the small break lasts anywhere from one to three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Employment law director Andrew Price told The Manchester Evening News that the situation was so bizarre and ludicrous, it was practically unbelievable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"While I do sympathize with One Direction fans, I hardly think this qualified as compassionate leave."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although it may not be the answer distraught 1D fans were looking to get, Price did say fans could take personal time to deal with the obvious trauma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"If employees feel this strongly about the issue, than they can request to take days off as a holiday."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Price added that while the entire situation may seem silly to a large portion of the general population, this isn't the first time they've encountered this kind of situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>When English superstar Robbie Williams split from Take That in 1995, bosses from around the country called in to get information as to whether their staff was eligible to take compassionate days to deal with the loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The answer, Price said, was the same he gave to concerned One Directioners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was quick to point out that so far his office had received zero phone calls regarding using a compassionate day over Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson's firing.</td></tr>
