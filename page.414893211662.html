<h3>Excruciating wait for Bali Nine ringleaders to go even longer, as Indonesia announces execution delay for up to a month ?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of the drug smugglers 'will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons,' without elaborating further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Jusuf Kalla took a phone call on Thursday afternoon from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the men's transfer to the execution site on Kambangan island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Indonesian authorities had already confirmed that Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, would be among the next group of death row prisoners to be executed, despite repeated appeals from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for their lives to be spared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The two Australians were convicted of smuggling heroin, a crime that carries the death penalty in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The news comes after senior government figures expressed concerns Mr Abbott had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo from execution by making comments taken as a 'threat' by Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ms Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians Sukumaran and Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful, Fairfax reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But on Wednesday, Mr Abbott linked the men's fate to Australia's donation of $1 billion in aid following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed more than 200,000 in Indonesia, and suggested the Asian country should 'reciprocate in this way at this time'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>President of Indonesia Joko Widodo and Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The comments sparked a sharp rebuke from the Indonesian government, with the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, hitting back by saying 'no one responds well to threats'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Senior members of the Abbott government slammed the prime minister's comments as 'awful'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sukumaran and Chan were due to be transferred this week from Bali to a high-security prison on Kambangan island ahead of execution, but that was delayed after appeals from Canberra that the men be granted more time with their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ahmad Yuspahruddin, chief of the Indonesian Justice Ministry's Central Java penitentiary division which governs the prisons on Kambangan island told Daily Mail Australia today that preparations were in place to put the two Australians to death by firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'Nothing problem, everything is okay here,' Mr Yuspahruddin said, 'Whenever the Bali nine duo will be coming we have prepared it for some days ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Indonesian authorities also cited logistical difficulties involving capacity at Nusa Kambangan -- the notorious island prison where five inmates were executed last month -- as a reason for the delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tony Spontana, a spokesman for the attorney-general's office which oversees the executions, neither confirmed nor denied the statement from the vice president's office but insisted the prisoners would eventually face the firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'What needs to be underscored is the execution will still be conducted,' Spontana told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo said a date for the transfer had not been set because more co-ordination was needed and he didn't think Mr Kalla would have given a timeframe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>'I've never said that and I don't think the vice president would have said that,' Mr Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At Kerobokan jail on Friday, meetings to plan the transfer to Nusa Kambangan jail continued, but no date was set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'As soon as Nusa Kambangan is ready, we'll send them immediately,' Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Gusto Kompiang Adnyana, head of Bali's Law and Human Rights Office, said: 'There's no time for the transfer yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The delay gives Chan and Sukumaran precious days with their families, and precious time for their lawyers to ready their final legal manoeuvres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Indonesia's pledge to proceed with the execution of the Australians -- just two of seven foreigners on death row whose appeals for presidential clemency have been rejected -- has strained ties between Jakarta and Canberra, a relationship only just recovering from a damaging rift in 2014 over spying revelations and people-smuggling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Melbourne barrister Michael O'Connell SC visited the death row Australians in Kerobokan jail on Thursday to go over arrangements for next week's administrative court challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They will argue President Joko Widodo did not properly examine their requests for clemency before rejecting them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr O'Connell says it's a strong case, but lawyers will first have to clear jurisdictional hurdles - whether Mr Joko's decree can be characterised under administrative law or is simply a decision that's a matter for the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>At the same time, the lawyers' complaints against the original six judges in the Bali Nine pair's trial are being examined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Indonesia's judicial commission has contacted the lawyers for more information about their concerns, which came after the original lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran alleged 'interference' that saw the Australians sentenced to death instead of life for the 2005 drug-smuggling bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It has been a roller-coaster week for the men, their families and friends at Kerobokan jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>At the start of the week, there were expectations the pair would be moved within days and Sukumaran's family began clearing his art studio of books.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Then on Tuesday, it was announced the transfer would not take place this week because isolation cells and the execution site itself were not ready to cater to so many prisoners at once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mr O'Connell said the Sydney men were coping extremely well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'They're humbled really by the depth of support that has been coming from Australia and to some extent in Indonesia as well,' he said on Thursday.</td></tr>
