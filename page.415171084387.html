<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Page frequently met up with other car fanatics at Wyvern retail park in Derby during the weekends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Sunday evening about 90 cars took part in a procession past his Derbyshire home and beeped their horns in his honour before gathering at the retail park, writing messages to put in lanterns and releasing them into the sky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His father added: 'From front to back, the cars went on for two-and-a-half miles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>I stood outside and watched them all come past.</td></tr>

<tr><td>29</td><td>I was having a lie in and I got a call from one of his friends at about 11am saying Will had been in an accident.</td></tr>

<tr><td>32</td><td>The paramedics were doing CPR on him but he'd passed away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'He'd been going in and out of the industrial unit all morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The barrier was one where you're supposed to bolt it back when you go through but Will hadn't done that.</td></tr>

<h3>Volcano erupts in southern Chile</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An estimated 3,400 people were evacuated from the area around Villarica, including parts of the towns Pucon and Conaripe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chilean authorities issued a red alert and sealed off roads surrounding the volcano, located in a tourist enclave outside the city of Temuco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The president, Michelle Bachelet, announced an emergency visit to the zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Government planes flew over the crater in an attempt to gather data following the 20-minute pre-dawn eruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The eruption followed weeks of increased activity in and around the volcano, including small earthquakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The snow-covered peak has a crater 180 metres across and a pool of lava estimated at 120 metres (400ft) deep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Considered one of Latin America's most active volcanoes, Villarica has erupted on average once every 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A major eruption in 1971 created a cloud of poisonous gases that killed approximately a dozen people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Authorities are concerned that lava and heat from the latest eruption could melt glaciers and snow on the flanks of the volcano and cause mudslides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Rio Turbio river was reported to have risen 15ft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Schools were shut in the four districts closest to the volcano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Police patrols to the area were increased to prevent looting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 2010 Bachelet was widely criticised for her response to an earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The emergency services agency known as the Onemi was reorganised and is now coordinated by a former army general, Ricardo Toro, who for years managed international humanitarian operations in Haiti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>If the volcano shows signs of increased activity, Onemi will next organise the evacuation of an estimated 20,000 more people from Pucon and the surrounding area.</td></tr>
