<tr><td>2</td><td>A fierce wind whipped the Croisette Friday, but it failed to ruffle Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, who walked the red carpet for Woody Allen's "Irrational Man" in a knockout pink gown from British couture house Ralph & Russo.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>In front, the thigh-split gown had a floral-covered plunging neckline, but that was outdone by the other side - backless, but with a train whose folds of draped fabric lent the look a hint of Greek statuary.</td></tr>
