<h3>What Crisis? Stronger Banks, Economies Ease Fear Over Greece</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In 2012, financial markets were rattled by the possibility that Greeks would elect a left-wing government, default on their debts and drop the euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The fears pushed the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index down nearly 10 percent that spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Here's how things look now: The left-wing party, Syriza, holds power in Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece actually did miss a loan payment to the International Monetary Fund late Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And the nation's future in the eurozone hinges precariously on a referendum Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yet investors seem to be taking events in stride.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Stocks around the world mostly rose Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Part of the calm reflects hope that Greece ultimately will reach a deal with its creditors and that Greeks will vote Sunday to accept their demands and keep the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But investors also have been reassured by the defenses the Europeans have built the past three years to limit potential damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Improving economic conditions in Europe and America help too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If things go off the rails and Greece is pushed out of the eurozone, the fallout should be temporary and modest," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I don't think it's going to be a major financial event ... I don't think it would have a meaningful impact on European growth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some analysts still warn that the fallout from a so-called Grexit is unpredictable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Seven years ago, few thought troubles in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market would trigger a worldwide financial panic and the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Panic, however, can spread in surprising ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Europe and the rest of the world appear to be in a much better position to avoid a doomsday scenario.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Three years ago, it wasn't just Greece that worried investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain, countries with a lot of government debt and shrinking economies, also scared them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Rescuing Greece was one thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But if all five countries defaulted on their debts, investors thought, Europe's currency system would likely unravel since the combined group was too big to bail out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>And if Greece left the eurozone, they fretted, other countries might follow, threatening European economic and political unity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Investors demanded onerous interest rates to hold the debt of the most vulnerable European countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rates spiked to levels that squeezed government finances and damaged fragile economies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In the early summer of 2012, the cost to borrow for 10 years topped 11 percent for Portugal, 7 percent for Spain and 6 percent for Italy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Then, in July 2012, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged to "do whatever it takes" to preserve the euro by pumping money into the financial system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>His words reassured investors and rates started to come down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Now, even with the recent turbulence, 10-year government borrowing rates for Portugal, Spain and Italy remain below 3 percent.</td></tr>
