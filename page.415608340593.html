<h3>Deadlocked Iran nuclear talks break off, to resume next week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (L) expresses his condolences over the death the of the mother of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani before a negotiation session with Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif (R) over Iran's nuclear program in Lausanne March 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Also at the negotiating table is European Union Political Director Helga Schmid (rear C).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - Iran and six world powers suspended negotiations on a nuclear agreement and were set to meet again next week to break a deadlock over sensitive atomic research and lifting of sanctions, Western officials said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While the talks have made progress over the past year, differences on sticking points are still wide enough to potentially prevent an agreement in the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>France was demanding more stringent restrictions on the Iranians under any deal than the other Western delegations, officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A European negotiator said the six power group - the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China - was generally unified but voiced concern that the Obama administration was under pressure due to concerns Republican-led Congress might wreck any agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The great paradox is that Congress and Israel have put the pressure on the Americans instead of pressuring Iran which is what we need to be doing," the official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Iran's delegation told the six powers it was returning to Tehran due to the death of President Hassan Rouhani's 90-year-old mother on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prior to the Iranian departure, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation chief Ali Akbar Salehi held another series of meetings to break the impasse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Technical and political experts have also gathered daily to discuss options that could form the basis of an agreement under which Iran would accept curbs on sensitive nuclear work for at least a decade and sanctions on it would be gradually eased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There was no breakthrough this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Disagreements arose among the powers, with France insisting on a longer period of restrictions on Iran's nuclear work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It also opposed the idea of suspending some U.N. sanctions relatively quickly if a deal is struck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Iran, which denies allegations from the Western powers and their allies that it harbors nuclear weapons ambitions, wants all U.N. sanctions to be lifted immediately, including those targeting its nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They insist they have to go immediately. No way. It is out the question," said a senior European negotiator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Zarif said the talks had reached a "very crucial point" and progress had been made this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He also suggested the six powers needed to reach a unified position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Given that Americans had officially said that further internal coordination meetings needed among the (six) members, the talks were ended and will resume next week in Lausanne," Iran's ISNA news agency quoted Zarif as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Kerry said they made good progress, adding: "We'll be back next week."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Russia's chief negotiator Sergei Ryabkov told Reuters he agreed wholeheartedly with Kerry's assessment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>During that meeting, Kerry expressed condolences to the delegation for the passing of Rouhani's mother and greetings for the Iranian new year holiday Norouz, which begins on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>U.S. President Barack Obama prepared a video message to Iran's people and leaders on Thursday, saying this year represented the "best opportunity in decades" to improve ties between their two countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But differences in the nuclear talks remained, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Western and Iranian officials have said that the sides are very far apart, though all delegations want a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Europeans and Kerry plan to meet in London on Saturday before the end-March deadline for a political framework agreement and a full nuclear deal by June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Not all members of the six power group believe March 31 is an important deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"For us the deadline is June 30," the senior European official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The London meeting is intended to bridge differences among the Americans and Europeans, negotiators said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Officials have expressed concerns that the French might block a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini denied there were divisions between Europe and the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"There is unity, there is unity on the fact that we want a deal, we want a good deal," she said in Brussels after talks with French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said the talks would resume on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>This week's re-election of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, a fierce opponent of engagement with Iran and critic of a possible nuclear deal, made clear that the pressure on the United States would not let up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Pressure from the U.S. Congress is also driving the pace of negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Obama bought some time on Thursday after U.S. Senate Democrats and Republicans agreed to delay until April 14 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's vote on legislation that would force Obama to submit any agreement with Iran for Congress' approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Obama has said a nuclear deal does not need Congressional approval and said he would veto any proposals for new U.S. sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Kerry the talks "must not fall short for lack of a final effort", China's Foreign Ministry said after the two spoke on the telephone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The biggest sticking point, Western officials said, remains Iran's demands to have no limits on research and development of advanced centrifuges, machines that purify uranium for use in nuclear reactors or, if very highly enriched, in weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Another is the lifting of sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Iran wants all United Nations sanctions and the most crippling U.S. and European Union restrictions on Tehran's energy and financial sectors lifted immediately after a deal is agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>A further area of disagreement is the duration of a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Obama has said restrictions on Iranian nuclear work should be in place for at least 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>U.S. negotiators are pushing to make it longer than that, while France wants it to last for at least 15 years with another decade of intense U.N. monitoring of Iranian nuclear sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>There are a few areas of tentative agreement, including that Iran could operation around 6,000 early generation centrifuges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>But officials close to the talks dismissed reports of a tentative deal, saying they were very far from circulating anything remotely resembling a draft accord.</td></tr>

<h3>Yemen's Islamic State affiliate claims mosque attacks that killed 137</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Suicide bombers attacked a pair of mosques Friday in the Yemeni capital, unleashing monstrous blasts that ripped through worshippers and killed 137 people in the deadliest assault yet targeting Shiite rebels who have taken over large parts of the rapidly fragmenting nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At least 13 children were among the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A purported affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the bombings, which also wounded 357 people - raising the alarming possibility the extremist group has expanded its presence to Yemen after already setting up a branch in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Earlier this week, the group claimed responsibility for a bloody attack on Western tourists in Tunisia that authorities said was carried out by militants trained in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Multiple suicide bombings claimed by the Islamic State group killed at least 142 people Friday at Shiite mosques in Yemen's capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>If the claim is true - and the U.S. expressed skepticism - Friday's attacks would be the first by the Islamic State group in Yemen, adding a frightening new layer to the country's turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Shiite rebels known as Houthis have taken over the capital, Sanaa, and nine of the country's 21 provinces over the past six months, raising fears of a civil war tinged with sectarianism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The government of the internationally backed president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, has fled to the southern port city of Aden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yemen is already home to the most powerful branch of the al-Qaida network, which has been battling the Houthis for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Friday, al-Qaida militants seized control of a southern provincial capital, al-Houta, in the group's most dramatic grab of territory in years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However, it denied carrying out the mosque bombings, citing instructions from the terror network's leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, not to strike mosques or markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Friday's blasts left scenes of bloody devastation in the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques, located across town from each other in Sanaa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Both mosques are controlled by the Shiite Houthis, but they are also frequented by Sunni worshippers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Images from the scene showed a number of children among the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In footage from the al-Hashoosh mosque, screaming volunteers were seen using bloodied blankets to carry away victims as a small child lay among the dead on the mosque floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Blood was running like a river," said one survivor, Mohammed al-Ansi, who said he was thrown six feet by one of the blasts at the Hashoosh mosque, where the floor was strewn with body parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The mosques were targeted by two suicide bombers each during midday prayers, when large crowds turn out to attend weekly sermons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The state news agency SABA put the toll at 137 dead and 357 wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Among the dead were 13 children, according to the Interior Ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A prominent Shiite cleric, al-Murtada al-Mansouri, and two senior Houthi leaders were also killed, the rebel-owned Al-Masirah TV channel said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It also reported that a fifth suicide bomb attack on another mosque was foiled in the northern city of Saada - a Houthi stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In the Badr mosque, the first bomber was caught by guards searching worshippers at the gate, where he managed to detonate his device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In the ensuing panic, a second bomber entered the mosque and blew himself up amid the crowd, according to the official news agency SABA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I fell on the ground and when I regained consciousness I found myself lying in a lake of blood," one survivor, Ahmed al-Gabri, told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Two worshippers next to him were killed in the explosions and another died when one of the mosque's glass chandeliers fell on him, al-Gabri said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Another survivor, Sadek al-Harithi, said the explosions were like "an earthquake where I felt the ground split and swallow everyone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>If Friday's bombings were carried out by Islamic State group supporters, it could be intended as a dramatic signal to al-Qaida, the group's rival - effectively a challenge over turf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That raises the possibility of intra-jihadi fighting as the two compete for recruits by showing who can unleash the worst bloodshed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In its claim of responsibility, an alleged Islamic State affiliate calling itself "Sanaa Province" warned of an "upcoming flood" of attacks targeting the Houthi rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The soldiers of the Islamic State ... will not rest until we have uprooted" the Houthis, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The claim could not be independently confirmed and did not give concrete proof of IS involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The statement was posted on the same web bulletin board where the Islamic State claimed responsibility for Wednesday's deadly attack on a museum in Tunisia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. had seen no indications of an operational link between the Islamic State group and Friday's attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He said the U.S. was investigating to see whether the IS branch in Yemen has the command-and-control structure in place to substantiate its claim of responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Earnest said it was plausible that IS was falsely claiming responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"It does appear that these kinds of claims are often made for a perception that it benefits their propaganda efforts," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Late Friday, Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council, said the U.S condemns the attacks and also condemns airstrikes Thursday that targeted the Yemeni president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The airstrikes by forces loyal to Yemen's former president missed his palace and Hadi was unharmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>In recent months, there have been several online statements by individual Yemeni militants declaring allegiance to the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The IS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, formally accepted their oaths and declared a "province" of IS in Yemen in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He and his deputies in Iraq have vowed to strike against the Houthis in Yemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>That has raised questions whether direct operational links have also arisen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>For example, in Libya, where IS also declared official "provinces," fighters and officials are known to have been sent from the group's core to build the local branch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>It also has fomented a rivalry with al-Qaida, with IS leaders mocking the terror network for failing to stop Houthi advances in Yemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Al-Qaida has denounced the IS declaration of a caliphate in areas of Iraq and Syria under its control and accuses the group of "driving a wedge" among jihadis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>In a further sign of the country's chaos, al-Qaida's branch of the country took control of the southern city of al-Houta on Friday, Yemeni security officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Al-Qaida militants driving pickup trucks and flying black flags swept through the city, which is the capital of Lahj province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>They took over the main security barracks, the governor's office, and the intelligence headquarters, which houses prisons with al-Qaida detainees, the officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Most of the security forces in the city - loyalists of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh - surrendered to the militants without resistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The militants killed 21 members of the security forces who resisted at the governor's office, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.</td></tr>
