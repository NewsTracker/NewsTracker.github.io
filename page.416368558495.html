<h3>Korver scores 21, Hawks hold off pesky Nets 99-92 in Game 1 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Hawks led nearly the entire game and pushed the margin as high as 16 points, but the Nets kept coming back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Finally, Jeff Teague dropped in a floater coming off the left wing, giving Atlanta a 95-89 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Joe Johnson missed a 3-pointer from the corner for Brooklyn, and Teague made a pair of free throws with just under a minute remaining to essentially seal it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Teague and DeMarre Carroll scored 17 points apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Eighth-seeded Brooklyn finished 22 games behind the Hawks and slipped into the playoffs on the final day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But, with Johnson and Brook Lopez each scoring 17 points, they didn't look overmatched by a team that won the season series 4-0 and earned a No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>1 seed for the first time since 1994.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Atlanta didn't have much to play for over the final month of the season, seizing control in the East with a 19-game winning streak that included a perfect January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Looking well rested, the Hawks started with the quick pace they wanted against the Nets, who would've preferred more of a half-court game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Atlanta pushed out to a double-digit lead before the game was 7 minutes old and looked on the verge of turning it into a blowout before settling for a 55-45 edge at the half.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Nets did use their size to good advantage, outrebounding the Hawks 24-16 over the first two quarters to keep it from getting out of hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In a striking contrast to the opening quarter, Atlanta began sluggishly coming out of the halftime break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Brooklyn began with a 9-2 run that cut it to 57-54, prompting Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer to angrily call a timeout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Atlanta quickly regained control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Paul Millsap scored on a strong move to the basket, before Carroll and Korver went deep for 3-pointers that pushed the lead back to 65-54.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But each time the Hawks looked ready to cruise, the Nets bounced back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Even though they fell behind in the best-of-seven series, this was an encouraging start for a highly paid team that underachieved most of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They lost the four regular-season meetings to Atlanta by an average of more than 17 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Also, the Hawks have to be worried about Millsap, their All-Star forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He looked out of sorts after missing five games late in the season with a sprained right shoulder, managing just 6 points on 2-of-11 shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Game 2 is Wednesday night in Atlanta before the series shifts to Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Nets: G Alan Anderson returned to action after missing the final seven games of the regular season with an ankle injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He scored 5 points in 15 1-2 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>... Lopez set a career playoff high with 14 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>... Thaddeus Young added 15 points and 10 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Hawks: Won their opening playoff game for the fourth time in the last five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>... Atlanta improved to 52-4 overall and 30-0 at home when leading going to the fourth quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>... C Al Horford sustained a dislocated right pinkie finger going for a rebound early in the fourth quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>X-rays were negative and he returned to the game with the finger taped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Despite being a perennial All-Star during seven seasons in Atlanta, Johnson was booed every time he touched the ball for the Nets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Johnson was dealt away by the Hawks in 2012, which ridded the team of a huge contract and served as one of the key moves in the rebuilding of Atlanta's roster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Despite stellar numbers, he was always viewed as a player who never quite lived up his potential with the Hawks.</td></tr>
