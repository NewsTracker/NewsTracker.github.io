<h3>Cavaliers sign guard Matthew Dellavedova to 1-year contract (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLEVELAND (AP) -- Matthew Dellavedova has hustled his way back to the Cavaliers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dellavedova, who emerged as an unlikely postseason hero when All-Star guard Kyrie Irving was injured, signed a $1.2 million contract for next season on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He had been a restricted free agent, and although the Cavs signed Mo Williams this summer to be Irving's primary backup, the team wanted to keep Dellavedova because of the energy he brings off the bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dellavedova accepted the Cavs' qualifying offer and he can be an unrestricted free agent next summer when the league's salary cap will expand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He made $816,000 last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Australian has endeared himself to Cleveland fans, and his teammates adore ''Delly'' for his non-stop hustle and attitude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dellavedova started 13 games during the regular season, but was forced into a more prominent role in the playoffs because Irving was slowed by injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With Irving out, Dellavedova scored 19 points in a series-clinching win over Chicago in the second round and he scored 20 in Game 3 of the NBA Finals against Golden State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He was hospitalized following the game for dehydration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dellavedova played in 67 games during the regular season, averaging 4.8 points, 3.0 assists and 1.9 rebounds in 20.6 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He shot a career-high .407 percentage from the 3-point line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In the playoffs, he averaged 7.2 points and 2.7 assists in 24.9 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>General manager David Griffin's goal was to re-sign the Cavs' core players this summer and he has gotten deals done with LeBron James, Kevin Love, Iman Shumpert, James Jones and Dellavedova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Cavs remain interested in re-signing free agents Tristan Thompson and J.R. Smith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Cleveland also traded center Brendan Haywood - and his expiring $10.5 million contract - and forward Mike Miller to Portland for two trade exceptions and to save luxury-tax money.</td></tr>
