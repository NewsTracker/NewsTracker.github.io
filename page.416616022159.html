<h3>Illinois man admits gun thefts as part of alleged plot to arm Ferguson protesters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- A parolee admitted in court Wednesday that he helped steal assault-style rifles and other firearms from a store during what investigators say was his plot to sell them to protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dakota Moss, 19, of Centralia, Illinois, pleaded guilty in East St. Louis to stealing firearms from a federal licensee, conspiracy to interfere with commerce by violence, carrying a firearm during a violent crime, possession of stolen firearms and being a felon with a firearm, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He faces up to two decades in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities say Moss played a role in stealing the more than three dozen firearms and 1,000 rounds of ammunition during a November burglary of a farm-and-home supply store in Centralia, about 60 miles east of St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The break-in came five days after sometimes-violent protests resurfaced in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson after a grand jury decided not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting death of black, unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Moss and an alleged 17-year-old accomplice were arrested separately after the burglary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A federal investigator said Moss said in a videotaped statement that "they were going to go to war just for the hell of it, but that the plan did not materialize."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clint County State's Attorney John Hudspeth said the case against Moss' alleged accomplice has been "resolved" and he is in state custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Moss' sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 31.</td></tr>
