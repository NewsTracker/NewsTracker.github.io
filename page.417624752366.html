<h3>Apple show: Music streaming, watch apps and 'El Capitan'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple kicked off its annual conference for software developers in San Francisco on Monday, unveiling plans for a music-streaming service, new apps for its smart watch and the overseas expansion of its mobile payments system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The service will combine a 24-hour, seven-day live radio station called "Beats 1" with an on-demand music streaming service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It will cost $10 a month for one person or $15 a month for a family of up to six people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The first three months will be free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The mobile-payment system, which had only been available in the U.S., will expand to the United Kingdom, next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple Pay will also start working with some store-issued credit cards and let users track and use rewards from some merchant loyalty programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Developers will now be able to make apps specifically for Apple Watch and interact directly with the watch's sensors and controls, such as the dial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Third-party apps for the watch had been limited to being extensions of apps that run on the iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple Maps will get public-transit information as part of an update to the iOS mobile operating system due out in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The update will also bring better battery life and improved security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple is also adding "multi-tasking" capability for iPads, allowing users to split the screen between two different apps and use both at the same time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The update to Apple's Mac operating system " dubbed El Capitan after a landmark in Yosemite National Park " will include features like the ability to run multiple apps in split-screen mode and pinning frequently visited sites on a bar at the top of the Safari browser.</td></tr>
