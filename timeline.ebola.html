<li>Tekmira suspends work on Ebola drug, will change name</li>
<li>NEW YORK (AP) " One of the companies that had been studying a potential treatment for the Ebola virus said Monday it will suspend its research on Ebola drugs and change its name.</li>
<li>Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp. said last month that an experimental Ebola treatment that it was developing would probably fail in a clinical trial.</li>
<li>Tekmira's experimental drugs were used in at least one patient in 2014 as an Ebola epidemic spread through several West African nations and the search for more effective treatments kicked into high gear.</li>
