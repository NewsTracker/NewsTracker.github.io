<li>Liberia calls for Ebola 'Marshall Plan' to rebuild economies</li>
<li>Sirleaf told fellow regional leaders and delegates at an international conference on Ebola in Brussels that restoring economic growth in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone is a long-term and costly task.</li>
<li>Even if the number of new Ebola cases in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone has dropped markedly, bringing it down to zero will still take a significant effort.</li>
<li>Ebola has undermined the three countries' already fragile economies, shifting resources resulting in other health care problems and hurting business as people grew scared to leave their homes or go to markets.</li>
