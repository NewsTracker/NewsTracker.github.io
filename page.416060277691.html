<h3>Mexico ambush leaves 15 police dead</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At least 15 police officers were killed in an ambush by a gang in western Mexico, an official said on Tuesday, one day after another attack against authorities in Jalisco state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Five other officers were wounded in the assault, which took place on Monday afternoon on a highway near the village of Soyatan as a convoy carrying an elite police unit headed to Guadalajara, Mexico's second biggest city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Authorities say the assault appeared to be in revenge over the arrest of gang suspects in an investigation into a failed assassination attempt against Solorio on March 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"These attacks are a reaction of organised crime after the attack against me," Mr Solorio said after a meeting of federal police, military and state security officials in Guadalajara.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Authorities did not identify the gang but a security source told AFP that they suspect the powerful Jalisco New General Drug Cartel carried out the assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In a previous deadly ambush, gunmen opened fire on federal police in the town of Ocotlan on March 19, leaving 11 people dead, including five officers, three suspects and three bystanders.</td></tr>
