<h3>Islamic State uses ancient Roman ruins in Palmyra to stage a mass execution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ancient Roman city of Palmyra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Beirut: Islamic State has released a video purportedly showing the execution of dozens of Syrian government soldiers in the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The footage shows 25 men kneeling on the stage of the site's historic Roman theatre, their hands tied behind their backs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With ritualistic precision, the same numbers of executioners then step out in unison, each taking up position behind one of the condemned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A large black IS flag is draped over the columns behind them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Wearing matching long brown robes and brown bandannas the executioners appear to be boys or young teenagers - few look old enough to grow a beard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Footage filmed from cameras trained on the soldiers' faces show that the men have been beaten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Then the child jihadists transform the world-class tourist attraction into a killing ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Simultaneously raising their pistols, they spray bullets into the heads and backs of the men, leaving them lifeless and bloody on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The video, circulated on Saturday on pro-IS social media accounts, is believed to have been filmed in the days after IS took control of Palmyra in May, when local activists reported that hundreds of captured soldiers were murdered by the jihadists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At the time, residents of the city were rounded up and forced to watch the killings, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The footage, filmed using professional techniques, appears designed to strike fear into Syrian regime supporters and counter accusations by IS' detractors that, unlike other jihadist groups in Syria such as al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra, IS has not focused on fighting President Bashar al-Assad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Syrian rebel groups have long accused IS of colluding with Damascus, citing examples where the jihadists have sold oil to the regime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Palmyra's ancient ruins are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and there has been concern IS might seek to destroy its heritage, as it has done elsewhere in Syria and Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The jihadists appear to have realised these fears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Extremists posted pictures last week of men smashing antiquities in Palmyra, including a 2000-year-old lion statue originally unearthed from the temple of the pre-Islamic Arabian goddess al-Lat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Man killed trying to launch firework off head during Fourth of July celebration Suspected Boko Haram militants kill dozens in Nigerian city of Jos in multiple attacks Islamic State uses ancient Roman ruins in Palmyra to stage a mass execution Greek debt crisis: finance minister Yanis Varoufakis resigns Greece's 'No' vote: What happens now?</td></tr>
