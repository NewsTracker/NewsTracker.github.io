<h3>Mexico deports 49 percent more minors in first 5 months</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - While the wave of child and teen migrants has dropped off at the U.S. border, detentions of Central American minors are up sharply in Mexico this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mexico's National Immigration Institute says detentions of Central American minors have risen 49 percent compared to the similar period last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It says about half of the 11,893 underage migrants detained between January and May were travelling alone or with a smuggler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Two-thirds were between 12 and 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One third were 11 or younger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The institute said Monday it was caring for the increased number of children through the country's child welfare agencies before they are deported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But as in the 2014 U.S. immigration crisis, there are accusations of inadequate facilities to handle all the minors detained.</td></tr>
