<tr><td>2</td><td>Showtime's new stand-alone streaming service will be offered on Roku media players and Sony PlayStation's Vue Cloud, the premium cable network announced Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The new service allows broadband Internet users to get the premium cable network's programming without a TV subscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Aimed at widening the distribution of Showtime and attracting the growing number of consumers choosing to bypass cable and satellite, the new service -- simply called Showtime -- is set to launch in early July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>As previously announced, the service also will be available on Apple's device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>PlayStation, Roku and Apple will have Showtime when it launches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>PlayStation Vue delivers streaming programming channels without a cable or satellite subscription over Sony's game console.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Roku makes streaming devices and offers more than a thousand channels to its users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Showtime, which has subscribers in 24 million cable homes, is offering the monthly service for $10.99 a month, putting it below the $14.99 broadband users pay for HBO's streaming product called HBO Now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Unlike HBO, Showtime will offer the streaming service subscribers the same live feed of programming that is offered to cable subscribers.</td></tr>
