<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The last U.S. man in the draw, Jack Sock, is making a real go of his first-ever match against Rafael Nadal, but is losing all the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sock is down two sets - 6-3, 6-1 - to the nine-time French Open champion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If Sock cannot turn around their fourth-round match, at least the 22-year-old will take away a few highlights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Check out the size of his grin, in this video, after saving a set point: https://twitter.com/rolandgarros/status/605390691687006209.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Serena Williams valiantly speaking French in an on-court interview can only mean one thing: The No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>1 has won again at Roland Garros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A strange fourth-round match from the 19-time Grand Slam champion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She looked curiously flat at times against Sloane Stephens but still fought back from a switched-off first set to win 1-6, 7-5, 6-3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Stephens threw everything at Williams, literally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In the eighth game of the third set, she tossed her racket at a ball that fizzed past her forehand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But it is Williams, not Stephens, who will be the only U.S. woman in the quarterfinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Very difficult,'' Williams told the crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Andy Murray overcame a partisan crowd and Frenchman Jeremy Chardy's strong resistance to remain unbeaten on clay this season and reach the last eight at the French Open for the fifth time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The third-seeded Murray was whistled and booed several times in his 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win but stayed cool to set up a quarterfinal against David Ferrer, runner-up at the French in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On the back of his best season on the slower surface, Murray is bidding to add the French Open to his U.S. Open and Wimbledon crowns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>When three-time French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario offered advice, Garbine Muguruza didn't think twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''I was like, 'Yes, tell me everything!''' she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And it worked: Muguruza is into the quarterfinals for the second straight year at Roland Garros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''I was talking to her in the locker room,'' Muguruza said after her 6-3, 6-4 fourth-round victory against Flavia Pennetta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>No other Spanish woman has lifted the trophy since Sanchez-Vicario last did in 1998.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>The 21-year-old was born in Venezuela but made her home in Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''In big tournaments I feel more motivated, and I can play my best tennis,'' said the No.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>Muguruza next plays Lucie Safarova, who ousted defending champion Maria Sharapova.</td></tr>

<tr><td>32</td><td>They are on court now, tied at one set apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''Roger forever,'' said a sign held up by Federer fans on the French Open center court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That's surely over-optimistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>But the 2009 champion gets to fight another day, into the quarterfinals for the 11th time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>For the fourth time in four matches against Gael Monfils at Roland Garros, Federer triumphed, winning 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1.</td></tr>

<tr><td>40</td><td>Monfils appeared to be battling a runny nose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Maria Sharapova battled a cold, wiping her runny nose and coughing during matches, through this French Open.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>But she's not blaming that for her failure to reach the quarterfinals for the first time since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Instead, the champion in 2014 and 2012 says Lucie Safarova was simply more aggressive than she was and found ''a different gear'' in her 7-6 (3), 6-4 win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>For the first time since 2011, the French Open women's final won't feature Maria Sharapova.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The champion last year and in 2012, and runner-up to Serena Williams in 2013, lost 7-6 (3), 6-4 in the fourth round to Lucie Safarova, who is into the French quarterfinals for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Safarova broke Sharapova in the second game of the second set, when the second seed double-faulted on break point.</td></tr>
