<h3>Libya's rival governments a step closer to peace deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The talks in Rabat, which continued for a second day on Friday, have been described as one of the last chances to stop Libya from plunging into full-scale civil war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Libya's politicians are split between the UN-recognised government in Tobruk and the General National Congress, a rival legally-installed government in Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The political turmoil has fuelled rival militias and allowed fighters claiming association with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group to gain control of the cities of Sirte and Darna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Following a second day of discussions on Friday, Saleh al Makhzoum, from the Tripoli based GNC, said that progress had been made.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Rabat, said sources had said the two rival parties had made progress on two main issues - security arrangements and the formation of a national unity government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Basically, they agreed on the security arrangements which include the implementation of a ceasefire, disbanding of militias ... and setting up the body which would look after security across the country," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"They have also made major progress about the national unity government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Our correspondent added that the parties are expected to meet again on Saturday before returning to Libya to meet with their respective governments to pin down an agreement.</td></tr>

<h3>Obama: Racial bias at Ferguson PD 'not an isolated incident'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country," Obama told "The Joe Madison Radio Show" on SiriusXM radio's Urban View channel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But, the President added, "I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Obama's first public remarks about the shocking Justice Department findings came as he prepared to travel to Selma, Ala., on Saturday for the 50th anniversary of the bloody confrontation between civil rights protesters and police on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The DOJ report found that police in Ferguson helped create the powder keg that exploded into several days of rage after a white cop killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The city's mostly white police force was found to be balancing its budget on the backs of mostly African-American residents by arresting, fining and abusing them - often without probable cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Federal investigators also uncovered evidence which led to the firing of one police department member for sending a racist email - and the suspension of two others for the same offense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In another radio interview, this time with Tom Joyner, Obama said that despite the progress in race relations over the past 50 years the DOJ findings about Ferguson show that civil rights "is an unfinished project."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In a lighter moment on the show that aired Friday morning, Obama said he didn't think his daughters Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, would follow in his political footsteps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I am very doubtful that they will want to run for public office, you know, partly because they've been listening to their mother," Obama said.</td></tr>
