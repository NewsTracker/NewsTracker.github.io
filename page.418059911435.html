<h3>German EU commissioner says 'GREXIT' unavoidable if no solution found in 5 days</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's not the European Commission's aim to see Greece exit the EU, but this may become unavoidable if no solution to the debt stand-off is found in the next five days, Commissioner Gunther Oettinger said, according to Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We will do everything up until the 30th for the Greeks to show they are prepared to reform," Oettinger, the EU commissioner for digital economy and society, told Deutschlandfunk radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"A 'Grexit' isn't our aim but would be unavoidable if there is no solution in the next five days," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new Greek government is engaged in tough negotiations with foreign creditors on the restructuring of the country's debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It came to power on a promise to stop the painful austerity policies of its predecessors, advocated by the creditors and which resulted in social and economic problems in Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Athens is short of the money and is unable to pay the national debt, which makes exiting the Eurozone and defaulting a possible scenario.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Over the past few days, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has been negotiating with the IMF and European officials on proposed reforms that his government is required to initiate, to secure a 7.2-billion euro tranche of bailout money and allow Greece to repay its 1.6-billion euro debt.</td></tr>
