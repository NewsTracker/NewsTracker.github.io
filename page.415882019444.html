<h3>Bali Nine final appeal to wrap up</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The pair's lawyers have resorted to the state administrative court in a bid to spare them from the firing squad for the 2005 Bali Nine heroin smuggling attempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The court in February threw out their challenge, determining it didn't have the authority to examine the decrees by President Joko Widodo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's now considering the appeal and will hand down its decision on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Wrapping up their arguments on Wednesday, lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, Leonard Arpan, said the administrative court had the authority to examine a clemency decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Clemency in the form of a presidential decree falls within state administrative matters," he told the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The state administrative court is the forum to challenge it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Outside court, Mr Arpan told reporters they had done their best to fight for the Australians, who await execution on Nusakambangan island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I don't want to go too far in assessing the conclusion from the state, for the sake of respecting the judges in making all considerations before giving a decision in this case," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In its summary, lawyers for the state argued clemency was a matter of presidential prerogative, not open for examination in the administrative court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In giving clemency the president has the right to accept and reject it, based on Supreme Court opinion, but then the president doesn't have to follow that opinion," lawyer Elhari said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Clemency is a political authority which makes it not under the state administrative jurisdiction."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Chief judge Ujang Abdullah said the judges would carefully examine the arguments and "cannot be rushed".</td></tr>
