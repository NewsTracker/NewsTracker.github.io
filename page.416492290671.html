<h3>Review: Getting your Apple Watch? Here's how to use it</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Apple Watches have arrived to the first group of people who had ordered one two weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Those who haven't bought one yet will likely face a wait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple's retail stores won't have them, with the company taking orders over the Internet only - for delivery as late as July for some models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Although a handful of other stores are carrying them, quantities are limited - and you have to make it to the store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Maxfield in Los Angeles is carrying the watch, along with boutique and department stores in Paris, London, Tokyo and Berlin and authorized resellers in China and Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Whenever you get yours, get ready for a new way of interacting with your digital life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A better way?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I'll need more time with the watch to say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Update your iPhone's software before starting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>You need at least iOS 8.2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>You also need the password for your Apple ID account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Select your language on the watch and open the Apple Watch app on the iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hit "Start Pairing" on both devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Here's where it gets fun: Use your iPhone camera to photograph the watch animation, which has an embedded code so the phone knows to connect to that specific watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Follow the prompts on the phone app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At the screen for installing apps, choose "Install All" to get watch versions of apps already on your phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It took about 12 minutes for all my apps, contacts and calendar entries to sync.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Use that time to watch video tutorials on your phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>You can adjust watch settings by going to "My Watch" in the phone app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Don't spend too much time at first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>See how the watch fits in with your lifestyle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Initially, notifications on the watch will match those on the phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If that gets annoying, customize the settings so that some notifications go to the phone only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>For email, you can designate specific contacts as VIPs and have only their messages reach your watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The watch borrows many gestures and controls from the phone, but that isn't always practical with a smaller screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Getting used to the changes will take time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>- Lightly press the dial, known as the Digital Crown, to toggle between the watch face and the menu of apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It's also typically how you exit apps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Double press to get your most recently used app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A hard press gets you Siri, Apple's voice assistant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Turn the dial to zoom, scroll or flip through menus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>My instinct was to turn the dial like a knob, but it's easier to slide your finger over it, like rolling the wheel on a toy car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>- The other button gives you quick access to friends - favorites from your phone's contact list and what you add under "Friends" in the iPhone's watch app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>You can call or message - or send doodles and vibrations if your friend has an Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Double click this button to use Apple Pay at retail stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>- Swipe down to get notifications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Swipe up to get Glances - highlights such as weather, calendar and stock quotes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Swipe left and right to go through the various Glances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The one on the far left is the settings, such as muting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>- Interact with icons and buttons by lightly tapping on the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>A hard press, known as a Force Touch, will activate other functions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>It changes from app to app, and the best way to learn is to try it and see what it does.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Force Touch the watch face to choose other designs and options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>- For a screenshot, press both side buttons simultaneously- lightly, or it won't work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Images appear in your phone's Photos app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>One of the Glances is for the Activity app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Go through the prompts so the watch can nag you when you've been sitting too long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The watch uses the GPS sensor on your phone to measure distance during workouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Without the phone, it counts steps, which tend to be inaccurate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>However, if you walk or run with your phone a few times, the watch will calibrate those steps for better accuracy offline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>You can listen to music or view photos stored on the device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Go to the phone's Apple Watch app to choose playlists and albums to sync.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Go to "Passbook & Apple Pay" on the phone app to enable mobile payments at retail stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>You can then pay without the phone with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>To add apps, visit the phone's Apple Watch app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Visit an Apple store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>No appointment is needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Besides the video tutorials, Apple is also offering free video chats online.</td></tr>
