<h3>Israel accuses Palestinians of politicizing in FIFA call</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israel's Football Association said Tuesday that Palestinians football officials are "injecting politics into sports" by calling on FIFA to suspend the Jewish state from world football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Palestinian proposal features in FIFA's published agenda for its election congress on May 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ofer Eini, president of Israel's FA, said his organization has done its best to assist Palestinian soccer, but that many issues were beyond its control and needed to be resolved at a political level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said the Palestinian proposal "is completely contrary to FIFA's vision" and could set a dangerous precedent for other countries involved in conflicts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Palestinians say Israel restricts movement of players in the West Bank and Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Israel has cited security concerns, especially regarding movement in and out of Gaza, ruled by the Islamic militant Hamas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Palestinian proposal is unlikely to succeed as FIFA President Sepp Blatter said last month he opposed the move, which needs three-quarters of votes to pass if a ballot is allowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>FIFA suspensions prevent a member's national and club teams taking part in international matches and meetings, and block FIFA funding.</td></tr>
