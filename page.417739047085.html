<h3>Polish prosecutors: US is obstructing CIA prison probe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WARSAW, Poland (AP) - Polish prosecutors say that the U.S. is hampering their investigation into the secret CIA prison by snubbing requests for vital documents, including the Senate report detailing CIA practices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Published in December, the report was redacted and did not mention Poland, but other facts in it pointed to the country and a prison there from 2002-2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Spokesman for Polish prosecutors, Piotr Kosmaty, said Saturday that Poland immediately asked the U.S. for a full version of the document, but has had no response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This is undoubtedly hampering the investigation," Kosmaty told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>One former Polish official has been charged in the investigation, underway since 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The U.S. report prompted Polish leaders of the time to admit - after years of denials - that they authorized a prison, but not torture.</td></tr>
