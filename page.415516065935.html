<h3>Is Facebook right to censor user content?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>More than 1.4 billion people around the world use facebook every month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And the content they post varies just as much as the places they are posting it from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Facebook users span different countries, cultures and laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And the company has always had a challenging task of allowing the freedom to post openly, while censoring content it considers offensive or dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Monday, Facebook issued new guidelines on what types of content is allowed on the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>And the reasons it bans some material.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The updated rules cover everything from nudity to bullying and what the social networking site describes as support for 'terrorism'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But how effectively can Facebook enforce its rules?</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And do users really want more restrictions on what they post?</td></tr>

<h3>Extra controls in place for storing and importing 1080</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The government has introduced new controls for all workplaces and laboratories using sodium fluoroacetate (1080) from April 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After that date it will be illegal to hold 1080 without having notified the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) of the quantity held and the supplier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Any new imports require an import certificate from the EPA before it can be collected from the New Zealand Customs Service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Laboratory managers must also ensure that 1080 is securely locked up when not in use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The new measures were introduced by the government last week, in response to a threat made in November to contaminate infant and other formula if 1080 was not withdrawn from use by the end of March.</td></tr>
