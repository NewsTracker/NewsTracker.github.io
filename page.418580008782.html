<h3>Footage of Russian-backed rebels ransacking MH17 luggage is sickening, Julie Bishop says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is sickened by footage apparently showing Russian-backed rebels ransacking luggage of passengers in the aftermath of the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Bishop said she couldn't verify the authenticity of the video published by News Corp Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It is sickening to watch and 12 months on from the downing of MH17 it is deeply concerning that this footage has emerged now," Bishop told the Nine Network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Bishop said it had been a tough year for grieving families and it would be an emotional day ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Their grief is inconsolable and the burden of grieving and then seeing this footage will be almost too much to bear," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The disaster killed 298 people, including 38 Australians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Bishop has flagged a second investigation report into the tragedy will be released in October.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The next step was establishing an international criminal tribunal, but Bishop acknowledged it would be tough to get it approved by the United Nations Security Council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An estimated 200 of their family members will attend a commemoration at parliament house in Canberra on Friday, which the prime minister, Tony Abbott, says he hoped will bring some comfort to the families left behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I know that nothing anyone can do can bring back their loved ones, nothing anyone can say can make it easier for them," Abbott told ABC TV on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This was not just a tragedy. It was an atrocity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Abbott suspects Russian president Vladimir Putin is horrified by the event and does not believe the Russian leader knew anything in advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The point that I made to (Putin) when we spoke about this was that, as a parent and as a human being, he owed it to the families of the victims to do what he could to try to get to the bottom of this," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It would be a credit to Russia if there was full co-operation with the ongoing criminal investigation into the plane's downing, Abbott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Toowoomba man Paul Guard, who lost his parents Roger and Jill, is in Canberra for the ceremony along with nine other family members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"I think it will be a difficult day, but hopefully a useful part of the healing process," he told ABC TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Abbott will join friends and family of the 38 Australian citizens and residents who died to unveil a plaque at the memorial service.</td></tr>
