<h3>Roosters&#039; Ferguson set for return</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Provided he comes through Sunday's training session in good shape, Sydney Roosters star Blake Ferguson will make his return against Melbourne on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sydney Roosters star Blake Ferguson has trained with the side at the captain's run on Sunday in a strong indication he will make his return from injury in Monday's NRL clash with Melbourne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Roosters coach Trent Robinson said Ferguson would be assessed on Sunday afternoon after taking part in the morning session ahead of Monday's match at Allianz Stadium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's pretty surprising actually. I thought he'd come back and take another week or two to get back into training, but he's flown back in," Robinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ferguson hasn't played since suffering an ankle injury against Canberra in late March and previously wasn't expected to play against for at last three more weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 25-year-old Ferguson, who has scored three tries in his four games for the Roosters, returned to training last Monday after spending two weeks in the US receiving treatment on the injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He's come back in and even done extra on sessions which is a good effort from him and a good effort from our medical staff," Robinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"He's shown his application to the training and also to the medical staff and their expertise and their willingness to send him overseas as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"In the end, it's Blake. Blake's desire to get back, do everything right and it's been a credit to him and our staff."</td></tr>
