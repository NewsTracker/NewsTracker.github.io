<h3>Bali nine executions: Andrew Robb shelves trade delegation to Indonesia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Major events at the largest Indonesian festival in Australia - INDOfest - have also been postponed because of fears that a family fun day would be seen as insensitive and incongruous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And Australian firms are delaying doing business with Indonesia due to uncertainty about any post-execution fallout, such as embargoes or the recalling of the Australian ambassador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Last year Mr Robb said one of his goals as trade minister would be to make Indonesia one of Australia's top 10 trading partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Austrade CEO Bruce Gosper told a conference in December that Mr Robb would lead a trade delegation to Indonesia in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However that has now been put on ice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A spokeswoman for Mr Robb's office said the minister intended leading a business mission to Indonesia this year at an "appropriate time".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"At this point no dates have been locked in," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Strengthening Australia's economic relationship with Indonesia remains an important priority."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Australia Indonesia Business Council president Debnath Guharoy said the executions were not "helpful" as far as business was concerned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"As I understand it, because of the current state of affairs it would not be an appropriate time for the minister to visit and talk business," Mr Guharoy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Trade minister Andrew Robb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Almost without exception we have one unfortunate event a year on average - if not more - between the two countries. If it's not cattle, it's boats. If it's not boats, it's [tapping of] phones."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However he said both countries were accustomed to the turbulent relationship and it did not stop business getting done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Indonesia Institute president Ross Taylor said given the current state of the relationship, it was "logical and sensible" not to proceed with the delegation in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said a trade delegation was vitally important but would be seen as disrespectful to the families if timed within weeks of the executions, and could pave the way for protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>INDOfest, which has been held annually in Adelaide since 2008, was expected to attract up to 15,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>However major events, including a family day in the park on April 12 and a trade forum, were cancelled as sponsors pulled out and concerns were raised that visiting Indonesian dignitaries could be embarrassed and local Indonesians put at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We decided that in the current context it would not be appropriate and rather insensitive to go ahead with the larger events," said Australian Indonesian Association of South Australia secretary Chris Majewski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Australia's trade relationship with Indonesia is underdeveloped, despite the proximity of the two nations and the enormous opportunities in a country with a population of 250 million and a growing middle class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Two way trade with Indonesia was worth just $14.9 billion in 2013, making Indonesia only Australia's 12th-largest trade partner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"In contrast with the $46 billion invested in New Zealand, a country of 4 million, the sum total of Australian investment in Indonesia stood at a paltry $9 billion at the end of 2013," Mr Guharoy told the conference in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Only about 400 Australian businesses have a presence in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>International trade and investment specialist Danny Burrows said he was seeing significant strategic decisions being put off because of the the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"From the Australian side I've seen a reticence to conclude joint venture agreements or finalise customer relationships because people are unsure what's going to play out, such as embargoes or the diplomatic recall of the ambassador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I've seen outcomes delayed in both infrastructure as well as businesses in the consumer sector such as manufacturing," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Burrows said he was urging his clients with interests in Indonesia to touch base and visit if possible.</td></tr>

<h3>LAPD officers shoot and kill homeless man after street altercation</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Five officers grappled on a pavement with a man known as Africa before shooting him five times in front of horrified onlookers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The victim, whose full name has not been made public, was pronounced dead shortly after the encounter, which unfolded just before midday in Skid Row, a neighbourhood of homeless people and shelters close to the financial district.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sergeant Barry Montgomery, an LAPD spokesman, told LA television station KTLA the incident would be fully investigated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It's going to be a long investigation and we will, you know, get to the bottom of it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The department did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for elaboration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>People at the scene and on social media expressed shock that a scuffle on a busy street in broad daylight ended with lethal force, putting police violence under renewed scrutiny in the wake of protests over fatal encounters in Ferguson, New York and other cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>People took to Twitter to link the cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Here we go. Again," said @sanacardi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"When will this end??" said @CaileyCron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some called for a demonstration on Sunday night at Pershing Square, several blocks from the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A report of an altercation between two people near East Sixth Street and South San Pedro at 11.36am prompted officers to the scene, said Jack Richter, an LAPD spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They Tazered and then shot a man during a struggle, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One officer was reported slighty injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The video, which was posted on Facebook, showed officers grappling with a man beside what appeared to be an improvised tent and other homeless possessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He resisted with flailing limbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A woman passing by scooped up a nightstick dropped by an officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Two officers handcuffed her while their colleagues continued wrestling with the man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A man - which appeared to be one of the officers - is heard instructing "Drop the gun, drop the gun," after which five gunshots are fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The officers stood back, some with guns drawn, and the homeless man lay motionless on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Onlookers gasped and remonstrated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"They just killed that man. They just shot that motherfuckin' man like that," said one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Witnesses gave conflicting accounts of events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Dennis Horne, 29, told the Los Angeles Times that Africa had been fighting with someone else in his tent when police arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>When he refused to comply with a police order to emerge, officers Tasered and dragged him out, Horne said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They tackled him to the ground, where he continued to fight, until he was shot, said Horne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"It's sad. There's no justification to take somebody's life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Another witness, Lonnie Franklin, 53, said Africa was lying face down on the pavement when officers arrived with guns drawn, yelling, "Down, down".</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>When Africa got up and started resisting the officers "went straight to lethal force", Franklin said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Another witness, who asked not to be identified, told the paper the man punched and kicked the officers and reached for one of their service weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Under a court agreement people are allowed to sleep on the streets from 9pm to 6am but must pack away tents in the daytime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Another resident, Ina Murphy, who lives in a nearby apartment, said Africa had arrived in the area about four or five months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He told her he had recently been released after spending 10 years in a mental facility, Murphy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Steve Soboroff, the president of the police commission, which provides civilian oversight of the department, told reporters the key issue was whether the dead man did indeed lunge for an officer's gun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Authorities were responding swiftly, he tweeted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"Thorough investigations by dept and our independent Inspector General proceeding simultaneously."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Civilian oversight and other reforms have improved the LAPD's fearsome image since 1992, when the videotaped beating of Rodney King set in motion riots two years later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But critics say the force remains prone to racism and unneccessary force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Last November officers arrested hundreds of people who gathered downtown to protest the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York.</td></tr>
