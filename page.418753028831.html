<h3>At Mexico's narco cemetery, palatial tombs await the inevitable end for gang members</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CULIACAN, Mexico - Palatial tombs mark the final resting spots of drug traffickers in the Jardines de Humaya cemetery in the Sinaloa state capital of Culiacan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The cemetery is known for the extravagant tombs commissioned by traffickers and their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman hails from this region and there were fears he would seek revenge against those who turned against him while he was prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But his escape doesn't seem to have sparked additional violence, apparently with few new burials here in the nearly two weeks since he slipped out of Mexico's highest-security prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Workmen on Wednesday were laying bricks and pouring concrete on one sleek, two-story modern-style crypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Such tombs are sometimes built in advance, according to those familiar with the cemetery's patrons.</td></tr>
