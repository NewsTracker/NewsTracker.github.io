<tr><td>22</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - A powerful earthquake struck Nepal Saturday, killing at least 718 people across a swath of four countries as the violently shaking earth collapsed houses, leveled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mt. Everest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>Given the scale of the destruction, the death toll is almost certain to rise, said Home Ministry official Laxmi Dhakal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It was a few minutes before noon when the quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8, began to rumble across the densely populated Kathmandu Valley, rippling through the capital Kathmandu and spreading in all directions -- north toward the Himalayas and Tibet, south to the Indo-Gangetic plains, east toward the Brahmaputra delta of Bangladesh and west toward the historical city of Lahore in Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later, and smaller aftershocks continued to jolt the region for hours.</td></tr>

<tr><td>34</td><td>Many came to the main hospital in central Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Among them was Pushpa Das, a laborer, ran from the house when the first quake struck but could not escape a collapsing wall that injured his arm.</td></tr>

<tr><td>37</td><td>As he spoke dozens of more people showed up with injuries, mostly from falling bricks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Following the quake, Kathmandu's international airport was shut down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.</td></tr>

<tr><td>43</td><td>Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who is climbing the Everest with a Belgian climber Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at altitude 5,000 meters (16,500 feet) when the earthquake hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>He wrote on his Facebook that they have started to receive the injured, including one person with the most severe injuries who sustained many fractures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"He was blown away by the avalanche and broke both legs. For the camps closer to where the avalanche hit, our Sherpas believe that a lot of people may have been buried in their tents," he wrote in English.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The quake's epicenter was 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu, and it had a depth of only 11 kilometers (7 miles), which is considered shallow in geological terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries, and witnesses said the trembling and swaying of the earth went on for several minutes..</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Several buildings collapsed in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers, said resident Prachanda Sual.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument.</td></tr>

<tr><td>54</td><td>In Kathmandu, dozens of people were gathered in the parking lot of Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses were spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some wearing hospital pajamas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>A woman with a bandage on her head sat in a set of chairs pulled from the hospital waiting room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Doctors and nurses hooked up some patients to IV drops in the parking lot, or were giving people oxygen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The U.S. Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9 but then lowered it to 7.8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>It said the quake hit at 11:56 a.m. local time (0611 GMT) at Lamjung.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>It was the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>The quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>A Swedish woman, Jenny Adhikari, who lives in Nepal, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi when the earth began to move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>"A huge stone crashed only about 20 meters (yards) from the bus," she was quoted as saying.</td></tr>

<tr><td>66</td><td>Residents reported seeing trails of destruction -collapsed walls, broken windows and fallen telephone poles - as they drove through the capital, along with streets filled with terrified people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>But scattered reports also indicated that most buildings in the capital did not collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>"It's too early to make any assessment but the damage isn't as bad as it could have been," said Liz Satow, the Nepal director for the aid group World Vision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>She said she drove from Kathmandu to the nearby town of Lalitpur and said that while there was considerable damage, most buildings were still intact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.</td></tr>
