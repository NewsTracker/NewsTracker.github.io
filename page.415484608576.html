<h3>Russia a land of plenty, but hard to reach from rebel east Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In contrast to the highly publicized Russian humanitarian aid convoys that roll into rebel-held territory, the kilometer-long line at the Uspenka border post testifies to the hardships common people endure in the conflict between Ukrainian troops and forces of the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"For now, the DNR are only good at fighting, they have no clue about civilian needs," said Vladimir, a locksmith who works in one of the region's many mines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said he arrived at the border crossing in his Chevrolet at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday to take his 78-year-old father to Russia for eye surgery no longer available in Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>By noon, he was still at the far end of the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Those in the line said rebel border officials were taking their time in checking vehicles and documents and the numbers wanting to cross had increased of late.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Moscow has vocally supported the separatists who took up arms against Kiev last April -- the West says with weapons and troops -- and Russia is a welcome escape from the hardships of the conflict, but traveling there is fraught with frustration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is a complete mess," said Mikhail, 60, who had been in the queue for more than 24 hours and still had more than a dozen cars in front of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Like many others he was queuing to leave in order to buy petrol in Russia, where it costs half as much as in rebel-held eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Despite their self-proclaimed independence, rebel regions still use the hryvnia, which has fallen to record lows since the start of the Ukraine crisis early last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It undermines trust in the new authorities," he said of the separatists, who captured Donetsk last April and then proclaimed their own Donetsk People's Republic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"When the election comes, do you think I will vote for them?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Early on Sunday, a convoy of some 40 trucks, including large gasoline tankers, tagged "humanitarian aid from Russia" crossed through the Uspenka point into rebel-held territory past the long line of cars waiting to leave the separatist stronghold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Some want to leave altogether, others just want to stock up on cheaper supplies, food and medicine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Some simply go to visit relatives who live only dozens of kilometers away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Is that what we fought for in here? We lived like animals before, and after all that, we still live like animals. I have family in Taganrog in Russia, I will no longer be here," said a pensioner who gave her name as Tatyana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Adding to the tensions among locals, car carrying separatist fighters often speed to the front of the line, bypassing waiting motorists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The head of the DNR border guard unit on site refused to comment on the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Fighting in east Ukraine has largely died out since a ceasefire agreement sealed in Minsk in February but some representatives on the ground from the OSCE, Europe's security watchdog, said on Sunday the number of incidents and violations has increased in recent days.</td></tr>

<h3>Islamic extremist group al-Shabab suspected in northern Kenya attack that kills 1, wounds 3</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The official, who insisted on anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak with the media, said the victims were believed to be non-Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attack comes two days after gunmen attacked the convoy of Mandera Gov. Ali Roba, killing four people including two policemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Roba survived the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Adan Duale, a Kenyan Somali who is majority leader in parliament, was quoted on the BBC Somali Service on Saturday telling al-Shabab to leave Kenya alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"If you wish to, we shall send you elders, religious leaders and politicians. We shall come, tell us your whereabouts. Leave Kenya alone," Duale said in a statement that many in Kenya interpreted as a call for negotiations with al-Shabab.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Duale said Sunday on his Twitter account that Kenya will never negotiate with "terrorists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Al-Shabab, based in Somalia, has vowed to inflict violent attacks on Kenya because it has contributed troops to the African Union force supporting the Western-backed government in Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kenya has experienced a string of attacks since it sent troops into Somalia in October 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Police said last month that 312 people have been killed in extremist attacks since 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In October, Roba's convoy was hit by an improvised explosive device as he was being driven to work, injuring one of his guards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In November, al-Shabab fighters hijacked a bus near Mandera, singled out non-Muslims and non-Somalis, and shot dead 28 passengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Twenty-two of those killed were teachers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ten days later, al-Shabab massacred 36 quarry workers who were non-Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Hundreds of teachers in parts of northern Kenya that border Somalia have refused to return to work, fearing attacks despite government reassurance of increased security.</td></tr>
