<h3>AP Exclusive: 'Breaking Bad' actor runs for Albuquerque seat</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILe - In this Jan. 18, 2014 file photo, Steven Michael Quezada an actor on the series "Breaking Bad," arrives at the 20th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Quezada is jumping in a race for a heated county commissioner seat in Albuquerque.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Quezada, who played DEA agent Steven Gomez in the hit AMC-TV series "Breaking Bad", said Monday, July 20, he will announce this week that he will run for the Bernalillo County Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Citing sprawl development and a need for more Mexican-American elected officials, "Breaking Bad" actor Steven Michael Quezada said he is jumping in a heated race for county commissioner in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Quezada, who played DEA agent Steven Gomez in the hit AMC-TV series, told The Associated Press on Monday that he will make a formal announcement on Tuesday that he's seeking the Bernalillo County Commission seat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 52-year-old actor and comedian said he's joining in the race because he feels someone like him can make a difference in the district which includes the historic Hispanic South Valley and an area in Albuquerque's Westside where developers are seeking to build new homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I think I bring a new face to the Democratic Party," said Quezada, a Democrat who is a member of the Albuquerque school board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We need to reach out to our young people - the young Chicanos, the young Latinos - and get them involved in this process and let them know this is important."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>At least three others are running for the open seat in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Bernalillo County Commission recently voted to approve a planned community despite activists' fears the development would take water away from nearby communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Concern of the development brought protests from South Valley farmers at commissioners' meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The master plan for a nearly 22-square-mile development known as Santolina would rival some of the state's largest cities once completed in 50 years, and it comes during a period of heightened concerns over water following years of severe drought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Quezada, who voted against the plan as a member of the Albuquerque Public Schools, said the plan lacked the needed schools at a time when the area is seeing school overcrowding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Quezada is getting active in New Mexico Democratic Party politics just as the party is licking its wounds from a historic defeat in 2014 with the re-election of Republican Gov. Susana Martinez and the GOP takeover of the New Mexico House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Other Democrats have sought Quezada's support and he has lent his voice for commercials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Quezada said the state party needed to go more to reach out to Latino voters, especially since New Mexico has the highest percentage of Hispanic residents in the county.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Javier Benavidez, executive director of the SouthWest Organizing Project, a group that opposed Santolina, said he was happy that Quezada and others were jumping in the commissioners' race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We are seeing the consequences of irresponsible development," Benavidez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We need leaders who are going to commit to responsible growth and not just recruit new Wal-Marts and chain restaurants."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Breaking Bad" follows former high school teacher Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, producing methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>FILE - This Jan. 27, 2013 file photo shows actor Steven Michael Quezada at the 19th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles.</td></tr>
