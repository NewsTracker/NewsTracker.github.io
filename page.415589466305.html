<tr><td>2</td><td>Cyclone Nathan made landfall shortly before dawn as a category four system, the second highest intensity rating, and was expected to continue its westward movement inland while weakening, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The storm was downgraded by the bureau to a category three system at about 2200 GMT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At its peak, Nathan was packing sustained winds near the center of 130 km (85 miles) per hour with wind gusts to 189 km per hour.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters there have been no reports of injury.</td></tr>
