<h3>NYC subway bomb plotter was under orders to pull off operation bigger than 9/11</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Assistant U.S. Attorney Celia Cohen told jurors in federal court in Brooklyn that the failed conspiracy in 2009 called for attacks in New York City, England and Denmark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She said that Abid Naseer, 28, who is acting as his own attorney, headed a cell in Manchester, England, where he attended college as part of his cover and communicated in coded emails with his Al Qaeda handler about the cell's plan to attack a shopping mall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The jury will be the first to see evidence seized during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that left Osama bin Laden dead, Cohen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In his opening statement, Naseer read in a monotone voice from prepared remarks in which he referred to himself in the third person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said that the time he spent on the Internet on sites like Qiran.com was part of his quest to find a woman to marry, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'The evidence at trial will not show the defendant is an Al Qaeda member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>... He has no extremist or jihadist views,' Naseer said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Naseer objected several times during the testimony by the first government witness, former Queens resident Najibullah Zazi, who pleaded guilty in the New York City prong of the plot that targeted the subways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For instance, he challenged the introduction of a photo of bin Laden but was overruled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'I agree with you that this case is not about 9/11,' U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie told Naseer during a break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the judge said Zazi should be able to reference Bin Laden in describing how he became radicalized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Aside from Zazi, other witnesses will include testimony from British secret agents who will wear wigs and makeup on the witness stand to conceal their identities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The agents conducted surveillance on Naseer and other terror suspects in Britain before their arrests in April 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>After no explosives were found, the men were released without being charged but ordered to leave the country - a fate Naseer avoided after a judge ruled it was likely he would be mistreated if he were sent to Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Naseer was rearrested at the request of U.S. prosecutors and extradited to the United States in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'That was the whole point of the Western operatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>... They knew how to blend in and conduct reconnaissance and pick the best target,' Cohen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile, a document said to be the Al Qaeda pledge of allegiance is among the classified papers to be disclosed at the trial of the alleged would-be terrorist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The trial of Naseer began in New York today after he pleaded not guilty to accusations of a conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway and The Trafford shopping centre in Manchester, England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Prosecutor Celia Cohen said in her opening statement on Tuesday in New York that Abid Naseer headed a terror cell in Manchester, England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The trial is set to feature evidence seized during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that killed bin Laden, including an oath Naseer presumably took on joining the terror kingpin's organisation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The pledge is among eight documents found among bin Laden's possessions and declassified for the trial, which will also hear testimony from British spies who have been given permission to take the witness stand in disguises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If convicted, Pakistan-born Naseer who denies he was a member of Al Qaeda, faces a possible life sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He says he holds 'no extremist jihadist views'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Two government witnesses to testify against him - Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay - have already pleaded guilty to the subway plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Prosecutors claim email account evidence shows all three men were under the direction of the same Al Qaeda handler.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They also say one of the now-declassified documents seized by SEAL Team 6 during the bin Laden raid mentions Naseer and refers to the Manchester and New York plots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The pledge of allegiance to Al Qaeda, which has been translated by prosecutors for the court's benefit, is also due to be given as evidence, according to the New York Daily News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>At a pretrial hearing, U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie approved a request from Britain's internal intelligence service, MI5, for its agents to give evidence in disguise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Prosecutors had told the judge that the officers continue to work undercover on sensitive cases and 'disclosure of their identities would pose a significant risk to their safety'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The agents will testify using identification numbers rather than names and wearing wigs and make up, the papers added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A former resident of Cheetham Hill, Manchester, Naseer was one of 12 people arrested in the UK in April 2009 as alleged members of an al Qaida-backed terror cell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In a lengthy written statement submitted during the deportation proceedings, Naseer claimed to come from a moderate Muslim family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>He said he went to Great Britain to get a degree in computer science, not to attack the West, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>'Committing terrorist acts is not justified, and I do not consider this to be jihad,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The time he spent on the Internet on sites like Qiran.com was part of his quest to find a woman to marry, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>'I used to spend all night on the internet in chat rooms talking to girls,' he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Naseer also denied allegations that he used code words to conceal messages about the terror plots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>In one, he talked about having a 'party' in Manchester in April 2009 - what British counterterrorism officials said was the proposed time for the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>'My reference to holding a huge party and trying to include as many as possible was referring to the intended wedding,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Authorities rearrested Naseer in July 2010 at the request of U.S. prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>He was extradited from the UK in 2013.</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt's el-Sissi wants a UN-backed coalition on Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt said Monday it has launched airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Libya following the release of the video, marking the first time Cairo has publicly acknowledged taking military action in neighboring Libya, where extremist groups seen as a threat to both countries have taken root in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's president said in a radio interview aired on Tuesday that creating a U.N.-backed coalition was the best course of action to rid Libya of Islamic extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, speaking to France's Europe 1 Radio, said Egyptian airstrikes against Islamic State group positions in Libya on Monday were in self-defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The airstrikes were in retaliation for the mass beheading on a beach of a group of Egyptian Coptic Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A video of the killings was release late Sunday by a faction calling itself the Tripoli Province of the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Asked whether he wanted to see a U.N.-backed coalition for Libya, he said: "I think there is no choice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He added that any intervention to restore security in Libya should be done with the consent of the country's people and government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We have abandoned the Libyan people as prisoners of the militias ... The militias have to give up their arms and must work in a civil context. We have to disarm and prevent arms from falling into the hands of extremists," el-Sissi, a general-turned-politician, told the French station in his first public comments after his country's U.S.-made F-16s staged at least two rounds of airstrikes in Libya on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"What happened is a crime, a monstrous terrorist crime that our children have their throats cuts in Libya and not to react. It's a kind of self-defense accepted by the international community. We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Egyptian attacks drew harsh criticism from Omar al-Hassi, the militia-supported prime minister in the capital, Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Libya's elected and internationally recognized parliament and government were forced to convene outside Tripoli when the capital was overrun by Islamic and tribal militias last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>An older parliament, supported by the militias, declared itself legitimate and formed a rival government with al-Hassi at the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This treacherous aggression and the terrorism carried out by the Egyptian air force is a violation of Libyan sovereignty and a scandalous violation of the U.N. charter and international law," said al-Hassi, who accused the Egyptians of attacking Libya "without any solid proof" that they were actually striking the militants responsible for killing the Egyptian Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>El-Sissi spoke with France's president and Italy's prime minister about Libya on Monday, and sent his foreign minister, Sameh Shukri, to New York to consult at the United Nations ahead of a terrorism conference opening Wednesday in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>At the United Nations in New York, the Security Council prepared to meet in emergency session Wednesday, as permanent council members expressed initial support for a resolution on a response to Libya's crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry laid out Egypt's proposals for a resolution: Lift international restrictions on arms to Libya's "legitimate government" so it can defend itself, tighten restrictions on the flow of weapons and money to terrorist groups in Libya, support a peaceful political process toward the country's stability and end the occupation of Tripoli by militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Militants should disband and disarm, he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>France, a lead player in the campaign to oust Libya's dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, has campaigned for months for some kind of international action in Libya, and announced a deal Monday to sell 24 advanced fighter jets to Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>French troops are already in place near Libya's southern border in Niger as part of a counterterrorism force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>French President Francois Hollande's office said he and el-Sissi both "stressed the importance of the Security Council meetings and that the international community takes new measures to confront this danger."</td></tr>
