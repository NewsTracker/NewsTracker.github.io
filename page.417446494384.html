<h3>Ferguson close to returning for Roosters</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Sydney Roosters say Blake Ferguson is training strongly and a chance to return from an ankle injury against Cronulla on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blake Ferguson remains a strong chance to make his return from an ankle injury against Cronulla next weekend, with coach Trent Robinson joking he may need to get tips from Mitchell Aubusson after a starring effort in the centres against Melbourne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Aubusson put in a polished performance in the Roosters' 24-2 dismantling of the Storm on Monday night, prompting Robinson's light-hearted suggestion for Ferguson to get a few pointers on playing right centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While it was said in jest, it illustrates the headache facing the Roosters mentor faces in reshuffling his side upon the one-time NSW star's return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ferguson will come straight back into the side when he recovers from an ankle injury, most likely against Cronulla on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ferguson ran with the side during their captain's run on the weekend but fell short of making his comeback against the Storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Robinson said he was no guarantee to turn out against the Sharks at Remondis Stadium however his progress was pleasing and he was wearing some big hits at training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We've got to actually see if (Ferguson) is going to play next week," Robinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"He's been training well but there's still some confidence to go and he needs to do a few more sessions this week before we get to the back end of the week and make that decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He's looking good but we had a bit of a joke he would have to spend some time with Aubo during the week to get some tips playing right centre."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ferguson's return means Aubusson will most likely to move back to the bench, despite being a standout against the Storm, where he laid on two tries for Shaun Kenny-Dowall and scored one himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Aubusson has been the side's Mister Fixit for most of his career since coming into grade in 2007, playing almost every position on the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kenny-Dowall said Aubusson's versatility was priceless and his selfless nature meant he was always putting the team first even if it meant playing out of his preferred position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"He can play in the middle, play on the edge, play in the centres, he can probably play on the wing if he wanted to," Kenny-Dowall said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He's got a great array of skills and he can attack and defend and those are priceless amongst the team environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He does what's best week in and week out and we're confident in his abilities."</td></tr>
