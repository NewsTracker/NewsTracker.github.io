<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, June 2 (Reuters) - Greek Labour Minister Panos Skourletis said on Tuesday that Athens could not make more concessions in negotiations for a cash-for-reforms deal and its international lenders must assume their responsibilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"There is no room for more compromises. We are waiting for the other side to assume its responsibilities," Skourletis told Greece's Skai TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Athens and its creditors from the euro zone countries and the International Monetary Fund are racing to hammer out a deal that would prevent the country from defaulting on its debt and potentially leaving the euro zone.</td></tr>
