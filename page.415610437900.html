<h3>New Apple TV with App Store and Siri 'will be unveiled in June'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Apple TV box is expected to feature a new design and updated operating system to support the Siri voice control and Homekit, which enables users to turn their house's lights on and off and change heating levels via an app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It could also come with a new remote control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple told The Telegraph it does not comment on rumour and speculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The latest version of Apple TV would be released in addition to an online television service, allowing users to stream video content from around 25 channels on their iPhones, iPads and set-top boxes, which was reported on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company is in talks with US broadcasters such as ABC, CBS and Fox to launch the service, according to the Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is thought that Apple's online TV service will be accessed via a subscription, costing between $30 and $40 per month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The new service could be announced in June and launched in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Apple refused to comment on the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple announced last week that it had secured exclusive early access to the forthcoming HBO Now streaming service, allowing Apple device owners to watch popular series such as Game of Thrones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"[Chief executive] Tim Cook&#x2019;s HBO announcement should have been a heads up on Apple&#x2019;s latest thinking around TV services. The company has been trying for years to get into the streaming TV market, and cash in on the demand from users for TV from their internet connection," said Jeremy Davies, chief executive and co-founder at analyst firm Context.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple sold more than $1bn of TV set-top boxes in 2013, with Mr Cook saying last year that this area of the business is now too big to be called a hobby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple's next big launch is a smartwatch, which is due to hit shops on April 24, priced at 299.</td></tr>

<h3>How to Turn a Computer Monitor Into a TV</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Off Duty's Michael Hsu shows you how to do it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Q: I'm in the process of outfitting a second home and am considering going TV-free there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(Radical, I know.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>We'll have a desktop computer that we can stream movies to, but we don't want it in the living room, nor do we want to have to watch around a desk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Any solutions?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A: How about using your monitor as a TV in the living room but leaving your computer behind?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The tidiest way to pull this off is with a tiny streaming video player, like the Roku Streaming Stick, Google Chromecast or Amazon Fire TV Stick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>These cost between $35 and $50 and stream videos from Netflix, Amazon, HBO Go and other popular services directly to the monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>With Roku and Amazon, you even get a small remote control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But you'll need a monitor that has an HDMI input (most newer models do) as well as built-in speakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Although speakers aren't a feature most people look for when shopping for a monitor, they are handy to have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The advantage of this setup is that it feels like a TV rather than a computer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>With a remote in front of you instead of a keyboard, you won't be constantly reminded of all the emails you've left unanswered as you enjoy your favorite flick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>And the screen will be bigger than a tablet or laptop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This self-contained system is also fairly easy to move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>You can reduce the number of screens in your space by toting the monitor from a desk to the kitchen counter or a coffee table.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although most new monitors with speakers would work, there are a couple of models worth highlighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The 34-inch LG 34UC97 ($1,299), for example, has a curved, ultrawide screen that's tailor-made for movie-watching (and working on spreadsheets).</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It has a USB port on the back to power your streaming media player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>(If your monitor doesn't have a powered USB port, you have to run a cord from the player to an electrical outlet).</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The monitor weighs a manageable 20 pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If you're looking for something smaller and less expensive, consider the Asus MX279H.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It has a 27-inch screen and less-powerful speakers than the LG, but it weighs about 9 pounds less, produces a great image and sells for under $299.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>This seems like a solution that will only work in limited cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In my den I have my All-in-one computer and on a small stand about 5 ft away is my 24" Vizio tv that has a DVR, DVD player, and an Amazon stick for streaming. If I'm on my computer it allows me to watch whatever I want on the tv. If my wife and I are going to watch a movie together we aren't going to do it on this tv in my den, we will use the tv in the living room that as an Amazon Fire box along with a DVR and DVD player. It sounds great to have only one screen to do all these great things but most peoples lives and homes aren't set up that way. Watch a tv on a proper tv, and do your on line work on a monitor. And who wants to tote a monitor around, plugging and unplugging inputs and ac power as it goes from desk to the movie watching area?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>These are all walled gardens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>You are better off buying a Miracast adapter like the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter so you can put your laptop screen on your TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Then you can stream from netflix, but still use your laptop full functioned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Also allows you to stream from sites that shows live sports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>I just take my MacBook Pro and plug into HDMI and play my vids that way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Then I just unplug and I'm back to computing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Easy peasy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I only use my 23" double-screens for writing - never watch movies on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>@MICHAEL A YOUMANS @David Frick Yep, that works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Negative is you have a wire laying around (to trip over) and it is difficult to use your Macbook at the same time you are streaming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Hah - absolutely correct on the non-use while viewing, but I don't have a problem with cords because I place the computer relatively close to the TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>All things considered, I don't like watching TV or movies on my computer screen - I am too old for that; tv is for tv stuff, computer is....well you get the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Mike Rice: that's a great solution for bringing your video collection on the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Thanks for sharing!</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Norman and Nandi: Thanks for your suggestion of going the other way around and using a TV as a computer monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>I don't advise doing that, however, because the pixel density of a television, even an HD 1080p model, is going to be much lower than a computer monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>TVs are designed to be viewed at a distance, not up close, and text will appear blurry if you try to use one as a monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>You also may experience latency problems, where there's a slightly delay when you press a key or move your mouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>You can also use Silicon Dust's HDHomeRun PRIME to turn every PC in your home into a TV that can access all your cable channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>@mike rice - what's your favorite method of getting these movies onto your portable drive in the first place?</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>And BTW, your one PC that js used to plug into a TV could soon also be a 'stick'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Checkout the recent such PC-on-a-stick concepts from Intel and some China/Taiwan companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>This is just a backward way for a columnist to write a puff for a TV product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>I carry a 2 terrabyte outside disk and a computer with me when I travel, as I'm doing while writing this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>I also carry along three computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>One of the computers is strictly for use as input to any hotel room tv, or an HDMI TV at a friend's house where I am now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Most PCs since midway in windows 7 have hdmi out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>So I plug the 2TB disk USB plug into the computer, then jack the HDMI out into the hotel set or the set at a friend's home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>There are 1,600 plus movies on this disk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>I've been accumulating them for over a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Rather than watch the usual programmed TV, I program myself, and watch only the stuff I like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>And there's plenty of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>I'm going to look at an early Elia Kazan pic Pinky (1949) which is playing on an alternate screen from local tv here in Sacramento.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Its been repeated several times locally on Movies, along with another Kazan- Boomerang, but I have my own copies and can look at them at my leisure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>I watched an old Gable-Marian Davies opus, Cain and Mable (1936) from the disk last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>I don't remember where I got it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>All it had for a label was Warner Brothers DVD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>I must have gotten it a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>@mike rice Good strategy, but even better, good movie selection!</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Mr. Hsu answers the wrong question.It makes much more sense to buy a flat screen tv and use it (at least part-time) as your computer monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>The cost curve for displays has been driven by television sales since RCA went retail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Flat screen monitors became price-viable because flat screen tvs became price competitive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Try buying a flat-screen monitor bigger than 24" -- and get ready for a price-shock. Now go buy that 37" HDTV (with a built-in advanced tuner, speakers, and WIFI) for less money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Or wait for 4K prices to come down a bit more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>@Norman Rogers Really!No wonder he saved the worst for last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>@Norman Rogers Really!</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>No wonder he saved the worst for last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>I've a 200#, 36" Toshiba CRT beast from 2003, one of the first HDTVs, but also one of the last good big tubers. I keep it in my upstairs den, where it still cranks out great 720 HD video and excellent audio, AND a really nice standard def broadcast for when I just want to watch the news or something on VHS. That and a 26" Samsung CRT next door work just fine for guests, who rarely end up watching TV here anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Save your money and invest it instead!</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Speaking of which, I should probably drop the extra cable boxes, since they're going unused at $20 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Wow - great solution to a problem almost nobody has.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>"TV free" usually means no need or desire to watch TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>But I guess for the segment that is not against the concept of TV but merely the hardware, this works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>A quick web search shows other Uverse customers had the same problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>But Uverse tech support was able to walk them through the process of getting it up and running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Good luck!</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>I tried a Chromecast with my tv, and it said it was set up right, but my router was blocking the signal to it.The router is from Uverse.Rather than take a chance messing up the router I returned the Chromecast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>I tried a Chromecast with my tv, and it said it was set up right, but my router was blocking the signal to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>The router is from Uverse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Rather than take a chance messing up the router I returned the Chromecast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Does anyone know, is this likely to happen with the Roku, Apple tv, or other devices meant to add internet to tv?</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Is it only a Uverse thing, or is it with all cable providers?</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>4k monitors, 4k streaming?</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>Why not buy a TV and use it as a computer monitor?</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>A TV already has built-in speakers and HDMI connection(s).</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>@Nandini Selvam -- My old Atari (circa 1982) used a TV as its monitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>What is new?</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>@Nandini Selvam -- Computer monitors generally have higher resolution than TV sets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>@Charles Perrin @Nandini Selvam For CRT's that was true, with modern HDTV's, it is no longer a general rule (and could be the other way around).</td></tr>
