<h3>New Apple TV with App Store and Siri 'will be unveiled in June'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Apple TV box is expected to feature a new design and updated operating system to support the Siri voice control and Homekit, which enables users to turn their house's lights on and off and change heating levels via an app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It could also come with a new remote control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple told The Telegraph it does not comment on rumour and speculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The latest version of Apple TV would be released in addition to an online television service, allowing users to stream video content from around 25 channels on their iPhones, iPads and set-top boxes, which was reported on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company is in talks with US broadcasters such as ABC, CBS and Fox to launch the service, according to the Wall Street Journal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It is thought that Apple's online TV service will be accessed via a subscription, costing between $30 and $40 per month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The new service could be announced in June and launched in September.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Apple refused to comment on the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple announced last week that it had secured exclusive early access to the forthcoming HBO Now streaming service, allowing Apple device owners to watch popular series such as Game of Thrones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"[Chief executive] Tim Cook&#x2019;s HBO announcement should have been a heads up on Apple&#x2019;s latest thinking around TV services. The company has been trying for years to get into the streaming TV market, and cash in on the demand from users for TV from their internet connection," said Jeremy Davies, chief executive and co-founder at analyst firm Context.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple sold more than $1bn of TV set-top boxes in 2013, with Mr Cook saying last year that this area of the business is now too big to be called a hobby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Apple's next big launch is a smartwatch, which is due to hit shops on April 24, priced at 299.</td></tr>
