<tr><td>3</td><td>In the biggest protest since 25-year-old Freddie Gray died on Sunday, two clusters of marchers chanting "shut it down" started out at different times before merging during the afternoon into a single wave headed toward City Hall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gray is the latest in a series of black men around the country who died under questionable circumstances during police encounters.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Last year, there were weeks of protests across the country following the shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the death of Eric Garner, in New York City who was placed in a chokehold during an attempted arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Saturday's protests came a day after Baltimore's police commissioner conceded that police had failed to provide Gray with timely medical attention for a spinal injury he had suffered sometime after he was apprehended and put inside a transport van.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Police have not explained how he sustained the injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He died a week after his arrest on April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>During the march, some of the demonstrators confronted about 50 police officers in front of the baseball stadium, where the Baltimore Orioles were due to play the Boston Red Sox at 7:05 p.m. There were no plans to cancel or postpone the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The demonstrators pushed up against a wall of barricades and waved signs at officers, who stood silently in two lines.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>He was carrying a switchblade knife, police said.</td></tr>
