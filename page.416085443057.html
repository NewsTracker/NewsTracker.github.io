<tr><td>3</td><td>Of the 30 charges, 17 are punishable by death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings, but said his now-dead older brother was the driving force behind the deadly attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the next phase of the trial, the jury will hear evidence on whether Tsarnaev should get the death penalty or spend the rest of his life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when twin pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>A federal jury found Tsarnaev guilty Wednesday in the 2013 terror attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He kept his hands folded in front of him and looked down at the defense table as the guilty verdicts were read.</td></tr>
