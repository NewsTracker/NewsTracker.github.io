<tr><td>4</td><td>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Boris Nemtsov's girlfriend has broken her public silence on the murder of the Russian opposition activist, saying she did not see the killer who gunned him down as they strolled across a bridge near the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Speaking largely without emotion in deadened monosyllables, Ukrainian fashion model Anna Duritskaya said she had little recollection of what happened in the moments after Nemtsov was shot dead on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She told online news channel Dozhd that she had not noticed anything suspicious as the couple dined at a restaurant overlooking Red Square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It had not occurred to her that someone might be following them as they headed across the river towards Nemtsov's apartment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I don't want to answer questions about what happened on the bridge. I don't want to talk about this," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I am in a very difficult psychological condition and I cannot talk about this any more now. I feel bad ... I saw no one. I don't know where he came from, he was behind my back," she said of the killer or killers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, was shot several times and killed instantly, becoming the most prominent opposition figure to be murdered during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tens of thousands of Russians marched through Moscow on Sunday to honor the former deputy prime minister and anti-corruption fighter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Duritskaya, who is 23 or 24, said she had been under constant guard since the murder and would probably be unable to attend Nemtsov's funeral on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>All she wanted to do was to go home to her mother in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I have every right to leave the territory of the Russian Federation. I am not a suspect. I am a witness who gave full testimony and did everything possible to assist the investigation," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They are physically not allowing me to go anywhere without them," Duritskaya said, referring to law enforcement officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They have explained to me that this is for security reasons."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Nemtsov, an opposition politician whose murder has deepened a divide between liberals and Putin supporters, will be buried on Tuesday at the Troekurovskoye cemetery in western Moscow, far from where Russia's top politicians are usually buried.</td></tr>

<h3>Boris Nemtsov case: Video reports conflict in probe of slaying of Putin critic</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>No suspects have been arrested since Nemtsov was shot dead Friday night on a Moscow bridge, a slaying that came just hours after a radio interview in which he denounced Putin's "mad, aggressive policy" in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>According to Russian investigators, Nemtsov was walking near the Kremlin on his way home with a woman when he was shot four times by an assailant, who then escaped in a light-colored car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was not clear what CCTV footage may have captured his slaying, even though the area is one of the most highly secure parts of the Russian capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The business daily newspaper Kommersant quoted anonymous sources in the Interior Ministry as saying there was no CCTV footage of his killing because the cameras in question were not working at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, Yelena Novikova, a spokeswoman for Moscow's information technology department, which oversees surveillance cameras in the city, said Monday that all cameras "belonging to the city" were operating correctly on the night of Nemtsov's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She said federal authorities also had surveillance cameras near the Kremlin that are not under her organization's control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The failure to dig up CCTV footage in such a public place as central Moscow has deepened the frustration of those who supported opposition leader Nemtsov, many of whom believe the government is responsible for his killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Geneva, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the Nemtsov killing a "heinous crime which will be fully investigated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He told the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had "immediately handed down all instructions and is ensuring special control over this investigation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At the same time he rebuffed outside interference in the probe, saying any "attempt to use the heinous killing of Boris Nemtsov for political purposes is despicable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Investigators said they are looking into several possible motives for the slaying and have offered 3 million rubles (nearly $50,000) for information about it, but so far there have been few leads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The one witness is the Ukrainian woman who was accompanying Nemtsov when he was shot, 23-year-old Anna Duritskaya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She has been under police guard for questioning since early Saturday, but in an interview Monday with the independent Russian TV channel Dozhd she said she had not seen Nemtsov's attacker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I didn't see anything," she told Dozhd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I turned around and all I saw was a light-colored car. I saw neither the brand nor the license plate of the car when it was driving away."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Duritskaya said she had known Nemtsov for three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>She said she had been questioned exhaustively by police and wants to leave the country but Russian investigators would not let her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>She is now staying at a friend's apartment in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Meanwhile, TV Center, a station controlled by the Moscow city government, broadcast a poor-resolution video from one of its web cameras that it said shows Nemtsov and his date shortly before the killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The station, which superimposed its own time code on the footage, circled figures that it said were Nemtsov and the woman walking across the bridge on a rainy night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A vehicle that TVC identified as a snowplow moved slowly behind the couple, obscuring the view of the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>TV Center then circled what it said was the suspected killer jumping into a passing car.</td></tr>
