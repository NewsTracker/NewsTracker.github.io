<h3>Israel's Netanyahu completes formation of government</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this Wednesday, April 22, 2015 file photo, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaves the podium after speaking during a Memorial Day ceremony to commemorate the country's fallen soldiers at Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With a little over 24 hours to go, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scrambling to get his governing coalition together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu has had a tough time striking deals with potential partners to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If he fails by midnight Wednesday then President Reuven Rivlin will task someone else with the job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday completed the formation of a new coalition government, reaching a last-minute deal with a nationalist party just before a midnight deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The late-night deal saved Netanyahu from the unthinkable scenario of being forced from office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But it set the stage for the formation of a narrow coalition dominated by hard-line and religious parties that appears to be on a collision course with the U.S. and other allies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>With a slim majority of just 61 seats in the 120-seat parliament, Netanyahu could also struggle to press forward with a domestic agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After Netanyahu's Likud Party won March 17 elections with 30 seats, it seemed he would have a relatively easy time forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But during a six-week negotiating process, the task turned out to be much more difficult than anticipated, as rival coalition partners and members of the Likud jockeyed for influential Cabinet ministries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The talks stalled this week when Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, a longtime partner of Netanyahu's, unexpectedly stepped down and announced his secular nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party was joining the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That left Netanyahu dependent on Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett, a former aide who has a rocky relationship with Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The talks with Bennett stretched throughout the day and well into the night before Netanyahu called President Reuven Rivlin, as required by law, to announce the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Netanyahu had until midnight to speak to Rivlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Otherwise, the president would have been required to ask another politician to try to form a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Jewish Home party is linked to the West Bank settler movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It opposes peace moves toward the Palestinians and has pushed for increased settlement construction on occupied lands - a policy that is opposed by the U.S. and European countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His other partners include Kulanu, a centrist party focused on economic issues, and two ultra-Orthodox religious parties.</td></tr>
