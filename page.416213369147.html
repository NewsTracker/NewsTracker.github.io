<h3>Celebrities Are Wasting No Time to Endorse Hillary Clinton</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's almost as if they have known she was running for ages and had been thinking about what they would post on social media when she announced for an obscenely long stretch of time!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The most entertaining social-media endorsements of Clinton were brief, realizing that a "yaaas" speaks a thousand words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hillary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>HERE WE GO @HillaryClinton!</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some endorsements came from dudes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>I feel @HillaryClinton will be a great President for the American people and she will make sure that everyone has a voice!</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I have an announcement: I'm not running for president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Yay #Hillary2016!</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Nice inclusive portrait of America @HillaryClinton - great message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It's on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>You betta work, @HillaryClinton!</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>There isn't much shocking about the massive support for Clinton from celebrities - those in the industry tend to skew Democrat, and Hillary is definitely the most recognizable person in the race for the presidential nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>She also has a history of support from celebrities; in 2008 she raised nearly $3.5 million from those in the entertainment industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Plenty of celebrities, perhaps noticing that there are hundreds of days until they have to vote, are reserving judgment ... or holding out for a fairy tale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>I don't know what's worse Hillary Clinton running for President or Coachella updates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I like Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I'm really hoping she does all the things Elizabeth Warren believes in.</td></tr>
