<h3>Iraqi forces 'push into Tikrit'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Iraqi government forces are advancing into Tikrit on several fronts, forcing Islamic State (IS) militants to fall back to the city centre, officials say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Soldiers and militiamen have reportedly retaken key sites including a police headquarters and a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Iraq's defence minister said Tikrit's recapture could serve as a "launch pad" for further operations against IS.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>The battle for Tikrit - Saddam Hussein's hometown - appeared to be entering a critical phase on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>About 3,000 Iraqi soldiers and police made a final push for the city, backed by 20,000 Popular Mobilisation Shia militiamen and a much smaller force of Sunni tribesmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Iraqi Defence Minister Khaled al-Obedi told the BBC that recapturing Tikrit could be a turning point in the battle against IS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He described the city as a stepping stone to other IS-held territory, including Mosul - the country's second largest city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The liberation of this city [Tikrit] and province will serve as a launch pad for reclaiming the north and the west of Iraq," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"If Islamic State is defeated here, they'll be defeated easily in other regions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Thursday, a security official in the Samarra Operations Command in Salahuddin province told the BBC government forces had taken the Industrial Zone and Celebrations Square near the city centre after seizing the Qadisiya area further north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The official said battles with IS militants were taking place near Celebrations Square, in the western district of al-Zuhur, and around the presidential palace complex built by Saddam in the south-east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Iraqi troops have been hoisting both the national flag and the flags of Shia Islam on their Humvees, the BBC's Ahmed Maher in Tikrit reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They are still held back from the centre by roadside bombs and booby-trapped cars, our correspondent says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A senior Popular Mobilisation commander, Moeen al-Kadhimi, told CNN 75% of Tikrit was back in government control.</td></tr>
