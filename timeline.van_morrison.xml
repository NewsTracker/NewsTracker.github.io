    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) - It's taken six years for Matthew Morrison to get back on Broadway so it's no surprise he knows a thing or two about where he ended up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just imagine her welcome guests back in her pearls and everything," Morrison said, sipping tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrison, 36, plays J.M. Barrie, the "Peter Pan" author, in the adaptation from the 2004 whimsical film of the same name about a widow whose four young sons inspired Barrie to write the children's classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's nothing more challenging or exciting than doing a brand new Broadway show," said Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show ended earlier this year and Morrison's last scene was of him singing "Teach Your Children" by Crosby Stills, Nash &amp; Young in dedication to all his fictional students, many who are in tears by the end of the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrison barely had time to say goodbye to Schuester before it was time to tackle Barrie.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;That number increased with Monday's release of Morrison's new album, "Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among his 16 duet partners: Mavis Staples, Taj Mahal, Michael Buble, Natalie Cole, the late Bobby Womack and Morrison's daughter, Shana Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Morrison, "There were two parts to it," the 69-year-old artist told The Times in an exclusive email interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrison has spent the vast majority of his career looking ahead, writing and recording a string of studio albums that now numbers more than three dozen; "Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue" represents a rare dip into his past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that event, Morrison invited Staples, Womack and Cole to go into a recording studio to get the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I first heard him in the '60s at a show with Aretha Franklin and Dr. John and I thought then, 'Who is this guy?'" Mahal told The Times at a performance Morrison gave last summer outside his hometown of Belfast.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
