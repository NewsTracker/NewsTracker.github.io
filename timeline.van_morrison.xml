    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;That number increased with Monday's release of Morrison's new album, "Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Morrison, "There were two parts to it," the 69-year-old artist told The Times in an exclusive email interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrison has spent the vast majority of his career looking ahead, writing and recording a string of studio albums that now numbers more than three dozen; "Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue" represents a rare dip into his past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that event, Morrison invited Staples, Womack and Cole to go into a recording studio to get the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I first heard him in the '60s at a show with Aretha Franklin and Dr. John and I thought then, 'Who is this guy?'" Mahal told The Times at a performance Morrison gave last summer outside his hometown of Belfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the tracks were done with the singers together in the studio, though for a couple - including "These Are the Days" with Cole - scheduling required Morrison to lay down the basic track and his vocal, with his collaborator adding her or his part later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
