<h3>Greece's government faces new criticism for secret euro exit plan</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FRANKFURT, Germany - Already struggling with internal conflict, Greece's government is facing new criticism over secret preparations that would have allowed the country to leave the euro if necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a recording released Monday, Greece's former finance minister detailed a contingency plan to create an alternative banking system that could switch to a new currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The system would be "euro-denominated, but at the drop of a hat it could be converted into a new drachma," the former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said on the recording of a July 16 interview with an investment organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The preliminary "Plan B" was authorized by Alexis Tsipras, leader of the Syriza party and now prime minister, Varoufakis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But he added that Tsipras did not allow the final plan to be put into action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Publication of the recording, whose contents were reported by the Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini on Sunday, led some opposition members to call for an investigation, putting more political pressure on Tsipras.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Greek government has never officially acknowledged making contingency plans for a euro exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The country's creditors are arriving in Athens for talks on a new program intended to keep Greece in the eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece needs to agree on the details of a new aid program before Aug. 20, when the country is scheduled to make a payment of 3.2 billion euros on bonds held by the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But Tsipras is dealing with a revolt in his own party over conditions that other eurozone countries are demanding in return for 86 billion euros in new financing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Tsipras has been able to pass legislation demanded by creditors only with the help of opposition parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Now the government is facing controversy about the euro exit plan, creating uncertainty for this uneasy alliance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"At a very difficult time of negotiations between the Greek government with the euro partners and the International Monetary Fund, it's creating unnecessary instability," said Theodore Couloumbis, a professor emeritus at the University of Athens.</td></tr>
