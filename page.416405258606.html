<h3>Ousted Egypt president Mohamed Mursi sentenced to 20 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi waves to supporters after he received a 20-year jail sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>An Egyptian court has sentenced former president Mohamed Mursi to 20 years over abuses of protesters while acquitting him of charges that would have seen the Islamist leader face the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In the first verdict in a series of trials he is facing, the Cairo court convicted Mursi of ordering the arrest and torture of protesters involved in clashes in 2012 when he was president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fourteen others were convicted on the same charges, with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the court acquitted the defendants on charges of inciting murder over the deaths of a journalist and two protesters during the December 5, 2012 clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Egypt's first freely elected leader, Mursi came to power following the 2011 ouster of longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But after just a year in power, Mursi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass street protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Other Brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and Tuesday's decision to acquit Mursi on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is a surprise ... We were expecting them to be convicted of murder," Ramy Ghanem, a lawyer for an anti-Mursi protester who was wounded in the clashes, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"But the sentences are not bad. We were expecting life in prison, but then 20 years is not very different," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hundreds of Mursi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called "unprecedented in recent history".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A Cairo court earlier this month confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and 13 others over protest violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mursi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty, including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Sisi has vowed to "eradicate" the Muslim Brotherhood, an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between Mubarak's fall and Mursi's presidential election victory in May 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The authorities designated it a "terrorist group" in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms.</td></tr>
