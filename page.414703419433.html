<h3>'Red Army' is a tribute to the Soviet soul on ice</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>If you want to understand ice hockey, the USSR, the power of Western cash, Russians, the dictatorial nature of the KGB, the authoritarian NHL and puck shooting as Marxist propaganda - while being entertained every step of the way with terrific humor - check out "Red Army."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Gabe Polsky's from-Russia-with-love documentary is an utter delight, the rise-and-fall-and-rise saga of five star athletes of Soviet hockey from the 1970s to the present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The "Ice Brotherhood" quintet played as a remarkably creative unit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They won universal admiration for their graceful skating and prolific scoring, but scant understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>From the end of World War II until the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russians were viewed in the West not only as villains but as alien life-forms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>When the U.S. hockey team upset the Soviets in the 1980 Olympics "Miracle on Ice," it was cause for national celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As youthful Ronald Reagan says in a black-and-white Cold War introduction at the beginning of the film, "How we meet the Communist challenge depends on you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Red Army" fills those gaps, telling a side of the story few hockey fans have encountered, balancing scenes of the team's breathtaking athletics with their touching, sometimes absurdly funny lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This is the sort of lighthearted film that presents a Soviet anthem with an animated image of a bouncing hammer and sickle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Polsky, who played hockey while growing up in Chicago and as an undergraduate at Yale, created the film with extensive filming in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Telling the story in authentic human rather than strictly political terms, he assembles a fine cast of sports stars and Cold War warhorses, all presented as memorable individuals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The central character is team captain Viacheslav (Slava) Fetisov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A legendary defenseman, he's also a great (though sometimes grumpy) interview subject.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If Polsky's inquiries go on too long, Fetisov, now 56, raises his middle finger during the interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>When he opens up, however, he's dazzling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He recalls his devotion to the sport and the Soviet national team since childhood, and the path that made him the unit's youngest captain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Through his memories and remarkable archival footage we meet the squad's fatherly mentor, Anatoly Tarasov, coaching his proteges through an inspired combination of chess and Bolshoi-quality ballet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He taught hockey as a sophisticated passing game, leading the team to years of East-West success, outperforming squads of American and Canadian all-stars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A lovable, burly old bear of a man, he helped his team work through training camps worthy of a "Rocky" film, sweating right alongside them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Then their aging tutor was replaced by a KGB-chosen slave driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Viktor Tikhonov was a martinet whose browbeating control made the team despise him so much that Fetisov considered throwing enough games that their coach would be dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If they needed a heart transplant, the team said, they'd want Tikhonov's since he'd never used it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ostracized by Soviet hockey's chain of command in the late 1980s, Fetisov chose to move West and play pro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He entered the NHL in 1989, playing 10 seasons with the New Jersey Devils and Detroit Red Wings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He helped recruit other Russians to the Wings, creating thrilling teams that earned back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1997 and 1998, but his American career became as troubled as his first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>His wife and daughter never felt accepted abroad and yearned to go home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Ultimately he returned to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Having won every medal there is in hockey, he began an equally successful political chapter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>His surprising climax resembles a fairy-tale happy ending, except that it was designed by Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>From its zippy opening to the hilariously unexpected finale, "Red Army" never misses a beat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It's a miracle on ice all its own.</td></tr>
