<tr><td>2</td><td>German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke to reporters in Barcelona, Spain, before flying to Berlin for a meeting late Monday with his counterparts from Russia, Ukraine and France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Steinmeier dismissed suggestions that Russia might be invited to attend the G-7 meeting hosted by Germany in June, but said Moscow shouldn't be isolated indefinitely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>According to remarks released by his office, Steinmeier said "the path from G-7 to G-8 will surely lead via Ukraine and the issue of the implementation of the Minsk Agreement."</td></tr>
