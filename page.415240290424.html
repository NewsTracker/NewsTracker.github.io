<h3>Fires kill 900 in winter's deep freeze</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DENVER - Nearly 900 Americans have been killed in house fires during this winter's deep freeze, federal officials and the Red Cross say in urging Americans to safeguard against the danger as cold weather continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At least 899 people have been killed in house fires since Dec. 1, federal officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That appears to be down from the 990 deaths in the same period the previous winter although statistics are still being compiled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"When temperatures go down, we see home fire numbers rise and deaths increase," said Anne Marie Borrego, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Requests to help people following house fires have jumped from about 5,000 a month this fall to 8,000 in January with more than $1 million in additional aid given out compared to the summer, Red Cross officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>House fires kill about 2,500 Americans annually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Cooking is the most common cause of fire, and smoking materials are the most common cause of fatal fires, according to the National Fire Protection Association.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But more than a third of all house fire deaths happen in December, January and February, the association said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>That's in part because people trying to stay warm overload electrical circuits, run improperly installed heaters and crank up their wood stoves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The cold also makes it hard to fight blazes because firefighters also are battling bitterly cold temperatures, deep snow and icy conditions, including slippery sidewalks and frozen hydrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It has been a deadly year," said Thomas Olshanski, a spokesman for the U.S. Fire Administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Michigan is seeing it. Wisconsin is seeing it. Everybody's seeing it. It extends even down into Texas and the South because the cold has been so far reaching."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Detroit had several major fires this winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On Feb. 17, a house fire in the suburb of Hamtramck killed a family of four, including two young boys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Six days later, a fire displaced 15 families from a 30-unit apartment building on the city's east side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In Massachusetts, an elderly woman and her son died Feb. 15 in a Waltham fire whipped by icy winds that made it hard to erect ladders, witnesses and firefighters said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On March 1, a fire destroyed a large home in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>And in the Chicago area, a man died March 4 after he jumped from the third floor of a condo building to escape a raging fire that took about 100 firefighters nearly 4 hours to control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This weekend - at 2 a.m. Sunday - begins the spring forward into Daylight Saving Time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Red Cross reminds people to change the batteries in their smoke alarms as they move their clocks ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Keep all potential sources of fuel such as paper, clothing, bedding, curtains or rugs at least 3 feet away from space heaters, stoves or fireplaces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Don't leave portable heaters and fireplaces unattended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Turn off space heaters and make sure any embers in the fireplace are extinguished before going to bed or leaving home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Place space heaters on a level, hard and nonflammable surface (such as ceramic tile floor), not on rugs or carpets or near bedding or drapes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Keep children and pets away from space heaters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>When buying a space heater, look for models that shut off automatically if the heater falls over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Never use a cooking stove or oven to heat your home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Use a glass or metal fire screen to keep your fire in your fireplace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Make sure it's large enough to catch sparks and rolling logs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Have wood and coal stoves, fireplaces, chimneys and furnaces professionally inspected and cleaned once a year.</td></tr>

<h3>A Clinton candidacy is weakened by string of revelations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Or who has her ear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Washington: Hillary Clinton is suddenly a weaker presidential candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While the former secretary of state remains a strong favourite to win the Democratic presidential nomination, she's now more vulnerable to a party challenger - and, perhaps more ominously, more likely to give an already-alienated electorate new reasons to drop out of the political process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The furore over foreign money and secret emails may be urging Ms Clinton to engage politically more quickly than she planned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>She issued her first personal statement near midnight on Wednesday night to address the latest concern - that she'd used a private email account to conduct United States State Department business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>She's been added to the list of speakers alongside her husband and daughter at a Saturday meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And she may be moving the formal launch of her campaign forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ms Clinton strove to defuse the latest controversy with a late-night tweet that tried, likely without success, to turn the tide of the email stories and make it appear she was the one demanding transparency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I want the public to see my email," she said, and added that she'd asked the State Department to release it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ms Clinton did turn over thousands of pages of emails to the State Department, but she and her aides decided which one to give the officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The department said it would review the emails, a process that could take several months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Hillary Clinton must think we're all suckers," said Republican Party spokesman Michael Short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The fact Hillary Clinton set up a 'home-brewed' email system in her house to skirt federal record-keeping regulations is a pretty good indicator of just how transparent she's interested in being."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Big money that's hard to account for?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>For the past 10 years, 40 per cent of top donors to the Clinton Foundation have been based in foreign countries, McClatchy reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ms Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, and she joined the foundation after leaving office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The flap is reminiscent of former president Bill Clinton's wooing big money by inviting well-heeled donors for coffee or to sleep over at the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Secret, private emails?</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Could be an echo of the early Clinton administration, when first lady Hillary Clinton, in charge of overhauling the nation's health care system, would not at first release the names of hundreds of people on her task force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Transparency?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I think I'm the most transparent person in public life," Ms Clinton said in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But would the public have learned of the email account if the Republican-led House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi incident hadn't uncovered it?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>To voters, all this opens Ms Clinton to more, sharper criticism about how she'd campaign and govern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The Clinton Foundation said it had acted properly in its fundraising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Like other global charities, the Clinton Foundation receives support from individuals, organisations and governments from all over the world. Contributions are made because the foundation's programs improve the lives of millions of people around the globe," it said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The Clinton Foundation has a record of transparency that goes above what is required of US charities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Ms Clinton retains some huge political advantages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"People already think they know her," said veteran political author Richard Reeves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"People who don't like her already will like her less, and those who like her won't change their minds."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>However, she faces two threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In the Democratic nomination race, the more she stumbles, the more a prominent candidate might decide to challenge her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In South Carolina, former state Democratic chairman Dick Harpootlian was livid about Ms Clinton's controversies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"It boggles the mind," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"She should be exemplifying a standard of ethics and transparency far beyond the minimum requirements of the law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>So far, though, Ms Clinton benefits from her stature and fundraising ability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Liberal favourite Senator Elizabeth Warren doesn't want to run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Senator Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Senator Jim Webb might.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>None so far has shown much ability to move blocs of voters away from Ms Clinton, and they refrained from talking about her this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>It's all part of a narrative that seems to acquire new chapters all the time, and the newest flaps rob Ms Clinton of any ability to become the juggernaut she wants to be.</td></tr>
