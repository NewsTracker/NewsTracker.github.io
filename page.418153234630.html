<h3>The next act: what happens now in Greece's drama</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - Greece has entered the twilight zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Out of money, cut off by its creditors, its banks shut, the struggling country will vote Sunday on whether to accept painful cutbacks in return for desperately needed financing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Between now and then Greece remains suspended between collapse and an uncertain rescue, between membership in the 19-member euro club and the possibility of a humiliating exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Q: What is the next deadline for Greece?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A: On Tuesday, the main part of Greece's bailout deal expires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>With no agreement to release the last 7.2 billion euros ($8.1 billion) from that deal, Greece is on its own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>An EU official said that after the deal expires, it would take weeks for creditors - other eurozone states and the International Monetary Fund - to put a new agreement on track.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tuesday is also the day Greece has to pay a debt of about 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>If Greece doesn't pay, it will take a while for the IMF to actually declare Greece in default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Credit ratings agencies say arrears to the IMF will not immediately trigger a default crediting rating for Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the IMF won't give Greece more money unless the arrears are taken care of.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That puts Greece in the same bin with fragile, war-torn developing countries in Africa and Latin America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Q: And after Tuesday?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has called a referendum for Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Greeks will be asked to vote if they support a bailout deal that creditors have proposed that involves budget cutbacks and tax increases in exchange for the remaining loans in the country's rescue program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tsipras is urging people to vote "no."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The catch, however, is that by the time of the vote, Greece's bailout program would have run out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>So the Greeks would be voting on an offer that has technically expired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU Commission, has urged Greeks to vote "yes" to a deal, no matter how it is worded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A "no" vote could mean euro exit is closer for Greece, as the country would have no outside financial aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Some think a "yes" could restart talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank, says that "should the electorate vote in favor of a compromise, the eurozone members will not be able to ignore that and will resume negotiations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>A "yes" vote, however, could lead to the collapse of the Greek government, as it is unclear it would be able or willing to implement a deal with creditors that it had so vehemently resisted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Q: Is a deal to save Greece still possible?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A: Technically, yes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>EU economic official Pierre Moscovici said Monday that a deal was "a few centimeters" away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>EU officials and creditors indicate they are still willing to strike a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Tsipras, however, has dismissed all their proposals so far as insufficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Q: Will Greece leave the eurozone?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A: Many see Greece's decision to close the banks as a step closer to leaving the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The banks' trouble is a bad sign, because the Greek government would need billions of euros if it has to rescue them without outside support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Until Sunday, the ECB had been keeping the banks afloat by increasing emergency credit as deposits fled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A modern economy needs functioning banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>For Greece that would mean printing a new currency and using it to refloat the banking system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Greece is also having serious trouble paying its day-to-day bills for salaries and pension.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>If it starts issuing scrip - official IOUs for payment later - that could be the first step in introducing a new currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Q: If Greece leaves the euro, will the shared currency fall apart?</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Since its troubles over high government debt started in 2009 - in Greece - the eurozone has built anti-crisis measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Those include a pot of money to rescue troubled governments and an offer by the ECB to buy the bonds of governments facing market pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The ECB's current 1.1 trillion euro bond-buying monetary stimulus program has further insulated markets from panic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The ECB says it will take additional steps if necessary to keep Greece's troubles from spreading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In the longer term, however, some experts think a Greek departure sets a bad precedent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Investors might think other countries could leave, and would require higher interest to lend those countries money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>That would hurt the countries financially, in the longer term, and market pressure could conceivable force them out too if they run into trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Q: Will a Greek exit from the euro hurt my investments, as the Lehman Brothers collapse did in 2008?</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>A: Stock were down globally on Monday, though there was no outright panic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew says no one really knows what the fallout would be from Greek exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Which is why he thinks it should be avoided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Demetrios Efstathiou, economist with ICBC Standard Bank, says it would not be comparable to 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"The collapse of Lehman Brothers came as a shock to the markets," Efstathiou said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"In contrast, Greece's dire financial position has been discussed to exhaustion, for many years now, and its bonds have been trading at distressed levels for many months."</td></tr>
