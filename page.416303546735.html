<h3>Cathedral service mourns victims from Germanwings crash</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of bereaved relatives gathered in Germany on Friday for a memorial service for the victims of last month's Germanwings crash, blamed on a depressed co-pilot believed to have deliberately steered the plane into a mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Flags were flying at half-mast nationwide for the 150 dead as political and religious leaders joined mourners at a midday service at Cologne's historic cathedral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Joachim Gauck were to attend the ecumenical service in the western city along with Spain's Interior Minister, Jorge Fernandez Diaz, and French Transport Minister Alain Vidalies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Some 150 lit candles commemorating the 150 victims of Germanwings flight 4U 9525 before a church service in Cologne's Cathedral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr was also to attend, along with three executives of its low-cost subsidiary Germanwings, Thomas Winkelmann, Axel Schmidt and Oliver Wagner, the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>About 1500 guests were expected for the service, among them 500 relatives of the victims, in northern Europe's largest Gothic church, which was broadcast live on screens outside the cathedral and to viewers nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ursula Mund, 53, said she would be among those watching on the large square in the city centre.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>He was receiving treatment from neurologists and psychiatrists who had signed him off sick from work a number of times, including the day of the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Aviation industry doctors have since demanded that German pilots undergo more extensive medical checks, while several airlines worldwide have changed rules to require two crew in cockpits at all times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Spohr, who is grappling with a heavy blow to the airline's image, asked Lufthansa pilots in attendance not to wear their uniforms to the ceremony out of respect for the victims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mourners began leaving flowers and lit candles on the stairways leading to the cathedral, and outside the city's main railway station nearby.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A bouquet of a dozen white tulips left at the towering cathedral had a card bearing the message, "Depression is incalculable," referring to Lubitz's illness.</td></tr>
