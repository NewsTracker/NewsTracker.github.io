<h3>Greece gets $14.5 billion to pay debts, part of new bailout</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece is receiving the first 13 billion-euro ($14.5 billion) payment of its new bailout, with 12 billion euros earmarked for repaying debts and the remainder for settling arrears to public sector suppliers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Athens is using the funds to repay a 3.2 billion euro ($3.5 billion) debt installment due Thursday to the European Central Bank - an amount it could not have afforded to repay without the bailout from 18 other European nations that share the euro currency with Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's Greece's third bailout over five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The new three-year bailout is worth 86 billion euros ($95.6 billion), and the disbursement of funds is dependent on the Greek government implementing a series of reforms, including steep tax hikes and spending cuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>European bailout fund supervisors approved the release Wednesday evening.</td></tr>
