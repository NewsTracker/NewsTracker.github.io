<h3>Syria Opposition in Egypt to Search for Political Solution</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt's foreign minister says his country is hosting the second meeting of Syrian opposition this year in a bid to champion a political process amid an international and regional focus on a military solution to the conflict now in its fifth year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sameh Shoukry spoke Monday at the start of the two-day conference in Cairo that brought together Syrian opposition figures, mostly secularists and tribal leaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Islamists groups and the myriad of armed opposition were not invited to the conference, which organizers say aims to find a formula on who governs Syria in the future, based on previous U.N.-sponsored talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Attempts to kick start political talks on Syria have stalled as the conflict, which began as 2011 protests against President Bashar Assad, has turned into a regional, sectarian war.</td></tr>
