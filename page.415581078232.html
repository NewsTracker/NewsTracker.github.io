<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu walks back his opposition to a Palestinian state</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jerusalem: Days after winning Israel's election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be backtracking from hard-line statements that ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hours before the election, with polls showing he could lose, Mr Netanyahu declared that the Palestinians would never have a state on his watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It was a sweeping statement that flew in the face of his own past commitments and 25 years of international efforts to arrive at a two-state solution to the conflict: Israel and an independent Palestine living side-by-side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The US suggested the newly declared opposition to a Palestinian state could jeopardise America's unwavering support for Israel at the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The US would "re-evaluate our approach" based on Mr Netanyahu's "change in his position", White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Now Mr Netanyahu has said in a TV interview that he remains committed to Palestinian statehood - if conditions in the region improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I don't want a one-state solution. I want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution. But for that circumstances have to change," he told MSNBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The question is whether Netanyahu - who shifted sharply to the right in the last days of his campaign, using messages such as his "no-state" pledge to successfully draw right-wing votes away from ultranationalist parties - really meant what he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And if so, what it means for the Palestinians, relations with Israel and the future of the peace process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One of Netanyahu's closest confidants, Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon, said on BBC radio the very idea of two states was unworkable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Can you imagine a viable Palestinian entity, economic-wise? What about infrastructure, electricity, water?" he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"They are connected to us like a Siamese twin, so the whole idea of full separation is not viable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Around Netanyahu and on the right-wing of Israeli politics - including party leaders likely to be in his next government - it is common to hear that the two-state solution is dead, with no way of reconciling Israel's security demands with Palestinian independence and no willingness on Israel's part to share Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek as a capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Instead, right-wing leaders like Naftali Bennett, the head of the pro-settler Jewish Home party and a candidate for a top post in the next government, advocate Israel's annexation of most of the West Bank, while granting the Palestinians "enhanced autonomy" within the remaining 40 per cent of the territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even under a two-state scenario, Israel talks about retaining major settlement blocs and control of the Jordan Valley, where the West Bank borders Jordan, leaving a patchwork behind, although land swaps with Israel would provide some compensation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The idea of dividing Jerusalem is dismissed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The impression that emerges is that Israeli leaders on the right would ultimately prefer a model in which the Palestinians have a high degree of self-rule but Israel's military retains control in a form of "benign occupation" of the West Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There is no active discussion along those lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Instead, Netanyahu's dismissal of two states will encourage the Palestinians to again seek recognition via the United Nations as well as bilaterally - 135 of 193 UN members already recognise the State of Palestine, including several EU member states, even if the EU itself does not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We will not backtrack from our position in demanding that international legitimacy be achieved," Abbas said on Thursday, adding that Netanyahu's words were worrying but not new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The shift may come from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In the past, including last December, Washington has stood in the way of Palestinian efforts to get a UN resolution recognising its statehood, including threatening to use its veto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But a US official said it was possible the Obama administration would now allow a Security Council resolution on a two-state solution to proceed by withholding its veto, a move that would alarm Netanyahu's government.</td></tr>
