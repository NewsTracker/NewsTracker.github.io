<h3>Netanyahu's party wins big in Israeli elections</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He appeared poised to earn a fourth term in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With nearly all the votes counted, Likud appeared to have earned 30 of 120 seats in the Knesset (parliament), putting it in a position to build a coalition government with its right-wing and religious allies with relative ease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years, and CBS News correspondent Barry Petersen reports it drew an enormous turnout of almost 72 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Recent opinion polls indicated he was in trouble, giving chief rival Isaac Herzog of the center-left Zionist Union a slight lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Exit polls showed the two sides deadlocked, but once the actual results came pouring in early Wednesday, Likud soared forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Zionist Union wound up with just 24 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Even before the final results were known, Netanyahu declared victory and pledged to form a new government quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Against all odds, we achieved a great victory for the Likud," Netanyahu told supporters at election night headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I am proud of the people of Israel, who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral, and to insist on what is important."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Herzog, who appeared poised only days ago to stage a coup, conceded defeat, saying that he called Netanyahu and offered him congratulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He signaled that he would not join forces with Netanyahu and would rather head to the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>To craft a coalition, Netanyahu will still need the support of Moshe Kahlon, whose upstart Kulanu party captured 10 seats and whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread-and-butter economic issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He is expected to become the country's next finance minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Petersen reports that, for some people, like Likud supporter Ellie Enyhu, the morning-after was good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He will take care of security," he told Petersen at the stall he runs at a market in Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He will only go to war when we really need to."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Physical trainer More Grossman told Petersen he wanted change, "to have a better economic situation in Israel, better security... and now we're faced with the same government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Netanyahu's return to power likely spells trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with President Obama, took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign, staking out a series of hard-line positions that will put him at odds with the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In a dramatic policy reversal, he said he now opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a key policy goal of the White House and the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He also promised to expand construction in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem, the section of the city claimed by the Palestinians as their capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Netanyahu infuriated the White House early this month when he delivered a speech to Congress criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The speech was arranged with Republican leaders and wasn't coordinated with the White House ahead of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama was confident strong U.S.-Israeli ties would endure far beyond the election regardless of the victor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Netanyahu focused his campaign on security issues, while his opponents instead pledged to address the country's high cost of living and accused Netanyahu of being out of touch with everyday people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A fourth-term in office would put Netanyahu on track to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister, a distinction now held by the Jewish state's founding father, David Ben-Gurion, Reuters notes.</td></tr>

<h3>New Shebab attack in northeast Kenya kills four</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Security sources said a group of at least four armed men threw a grenade at a small shop in the town on Tuesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They also opened fire before escaping on foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The attack is the fourth in five days in Kenya's remote and increasingly lawless northeast, which borders war-torn Somalia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The assailants killed four people and wounded three others who were inside the shop at the time of the raid," said county police commander Samuel Mukindia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Local police said the shop caught fire, burning the bodies of the victims beyond recognition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Somalia's Shebab militants claimed responsibility for the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We attacked Wajir and killed four. Such attacks will continue," said Abdulaziz Abu Musab, a spokesman for the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Friday the convoy of the governor of Mandera, Ali Roba, was ambushed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Gunmen carried out a drive-by shooting in Mandera town on Sunday and on Monday a bomb was detonated at a nearby border post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The recent string of attacks has so far claimed at least eight lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>On Monday Roba said the security situation in northeast Kenya was "extremely hopeless".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In November, Shebab gunmen held up a bus outside Mandera town, separated passengers according to religion and executed 28 non-Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ten days later 36 non-Muslim quarry workers were also massacred in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Shebab has threatened to continue its attacks until Kenya pulls its soldiers out of Somalia, where they are part of an African Union mission aimed at defeating the insurgents and protecting the internationally backed government in Mogadishu.</td></tr>
