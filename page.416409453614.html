<h3>Jake Gyllenhaal, Guillermo del Toro Join Coen Brothers on Cannes Jury</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As jury presidents this year, Joel and Ethan Coen will mark the first time the Cannes Film Festival has a duo at the helm, although the brothers each will have their own vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The fest has now rounded out the panel for the 68th event with three men and four women &#x2014; one of whom means a certain once-tipped film will not be added to the competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Joining the Coens are Spanish actress and Pedro Almodovar muse Rossy de Palma; French star and director Sophie Marceau; Mali-born singer-songwriter Rokia Traor&#xE9;; and British actress Sienna Miller who is next up in Ben Wheatley&#x2019;s High-Rise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Her slot on the jury thus puts speculation to bed that Thierry Fr&#xE9;maux may have included that title in the films he&#x2019;s yet to unveil for the main section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Making up the male contingent are Guillermo del Toro whose Pan&#x2019;s Labyrinth screened in Competition in 2006 and who&#x2019;s next up with Crimson Peak; Canadian wonder Xavier Dolan whose 5th film, Mommy, graduated him to the Competition last year and earned him the Jury Prize; and Jake Gyllenhaal &#x2014; who was in Denis Villeneuve&#x2019;s Prisoners and Enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The director is marking his first time in Competition with Sicario this year meaning Gyllenhaal is likely going to have to endure questions from the press corps about his ability to stay impartial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The fest runs May 13-24 with yet more titles to be announced.</td></tr>
