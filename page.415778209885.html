<h3>Japan beats Tunisia 2-0 in debut of new coach Halilhodzic</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Halilhodzic brought Honda and Okazaki into the game early in the second half, and the moves paid off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Okazaki scored on a header off a Honda cross in the 78th minute, and Honda doubled the advantage five minutes later when he picked up a loose ball and fired past goalkeeper Moez Ben Cherifia from close range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Halilhodzic, who guided Algeria to the last 16 of the World Cup last year, took over from Javier Aguirre after the Mexican was fired last month amid a match-fixing scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Japan dominated play in the first half and came close when Kenga Kawamata's header off a corner kick hit the crossbar.</td></tr>
