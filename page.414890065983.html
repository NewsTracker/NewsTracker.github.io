<h3>Clinton Foundation defends fundraising practices</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The foundation run by the Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, has come under scrutiny for its practices of raising money from foreign governments as Hillary Clinton considers a presidential campaign in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Wall Street Journal reported the foundation received money in 2014 from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman.</td></tr>
