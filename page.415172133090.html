<h3>Hillary Clinton used private e-mail for State Department business</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Clinton did not even have an official government email address, and her aides are now sifting through tens of thousands of documents and deciding which to hand over to the State Department, according to The New York Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The aides already have turned over 55,000 pages from the personal account after the State Department officials asked for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The flaunting of federal email policy drew fire from a former Obama administration official as well as Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I think it is, obviously highly unusual," former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said on NBC's Today show on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gibbs said Clinton had some explaining to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There are lots of briefings that you have, certainly when you go into the White House about preserving any email that you have, making sure it's part of your official account," Gibbs said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I think this is another one of those things the Clinton campaign, such as it is, is going to have to explain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton is expected to make another run for the White House but has yet to officially announce her candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Republicans pounced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>White House hopeful Jeb Bush noted that he released all his official communication from his time as Florida governor at http://www.jebemails.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Hillary Clinton should release her e-mails. Hopefully she hasn't already destroyed them," said Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton defended her use of her private email account for official business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved," said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the agency last year sent a letter to former to Clinton and other former secretaries of state for help in preserving their email records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some 300 of the emails Clinton has turned over were given to a congressional panel investigating the 2012 deaths of four Americans at US facilities in Benghazi, Libya, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Psaki insisted that Clinton has been complying with the rules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton's records - including emails between her and department officials with state.gov accounts, as well as cables," said Psaki.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Clinton's use of her personal account raises security concerns, as the account of one of her aides, Sidney Blumenthal, was compromised in 2013 by the notorious hacker Guccifer, the Washington Post reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Blumenthal hack also exposed the fact that Clinton had created her own domain, " clintonemail.com," to host the email account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The domain was registered on the same day her confirmation hearings to become Secretary of State began in 2009.</td></tr>

<h3>South Sudan rebels: President needs to make more concessions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>South Sudan's warring factions have "disagreed on almost everything" since the resumption last week of the final round of negotiations in Ethiopia, according to Puoch Riek Deng, a spokesman for rebel leader Riek Machar who is attending ongoing talks in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said he hoped President Salva Kiir - who arrived in Ethiopia early Tuesday to attend direct talks with Machar - would make concessions on issues such as power and wealth sharing with the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He added that the government has rejected the amalgamation of troops formed since the start of the current conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Machar's camp also wants South Sudan's government to clear debts accumulated by the rebels since the outbreak of the conflict, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Regional mediators have given the factions up to March 5 to try to reach a conclusive peace deal, even though sporadic violence persists in parts of South Sudan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which is mediating the talks, said Tuesday that issues yet to be agreed on include the structure of a possible unity government, power ratios, the composition of the national assembly, and transitional security arrangements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Difficult compromises must be made by both sides," Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said Tuesday after meeting representatives of both sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The region is frustrated. The solution is in your hands. Do not throw it away any longer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Both sides have accused each other of violating multiple agreements that have failed to end the violence which erupted in the world's newest nation in December 2013, and has killed thousands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution, drafted by the United States, that says an arms embargo is possible if the warring sides can't stick to a peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It does not explicitly name Kiir or Machar as possible targets for sanctions that would include an asset freeze and travel ban.</td></tr>
