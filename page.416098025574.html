<h3>30 new Ebola cases, lowest weekly figure in nearly a year: WHO</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"This is the lowest weekly total since the third week of May 2014," the WHO said in its latest update.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The virus is receding in Liberia, which reported no cases in the week to April 5, and in Sierra Leone, which reported nine, its fifth consecutive weekly decrease, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the picture was "mixed" in Guinea, which had 21 new infections, the WHO said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Unsafe burials of bodies continued in Guinea and "unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks", it warned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Ebola epidemic, which began in December 2013, has claimed 10,572 lives among 25,515 known cases, according to the United Nations health agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The WHO has called a meeting of independent experts this week to review whether West Africa's outbreak still constitutes a "public health emergency of international concern", which it declared in August 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A decision is due on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ebola is still spreading in western Guinea, including the capital Conakry, but detection of the disease has improved, the WHO said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"A three-day door-to-door campaign to improve community participation in surveillance activities and identify suspected cases will begin on 10 April (Friday)", it added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The last known Ebola case in Liberia was a patient who died on March 27, and whose 332 contacts are being monitored but none have shown symptoms so far, it said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country," the WHO said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"In the context of falling case incidence and a receding zone of transmission, treatment capacity exceeds demand in Liberia and Sierra Leone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Each country would retain a core capacity of high-quality Ebola treatment centres, strategically located to ensure complete geographic coverage, with additional rapid-response capacity held in reserve.</td></tr>
