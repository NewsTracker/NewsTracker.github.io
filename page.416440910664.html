<h3>Hernandez goal puts Real Madrid into Champions League semis (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MADRID (AP) -- A late goal by Javier ''Chicharito'' Hernandez gave Real Madrid a tense 1-0 win over 10-man Atletico Madrid and a place in the Champions League semifinals on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After the first leg of their quarterfinal had finished 0-0 last week, Hernandez missed three good chances to break the deadlock for the holders before finding the net in the 88th minute from close range following a pass by Cristiano Ronaldo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>By then, Atletico was down to 10 men after midfielder Arda Turan was sent off for a second yellow card following a rash challenge on Madrid's Sergio Ramos in the 76th minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As in the first leg of the derby between last season's finalists, Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak kept his team in the tie by saving a series of shots on goal by Madrid's forwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the night's other match, Juventus drew 0-0 at Monaco to reach the semifinals with a 1-0 victory on aggregate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At the Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid began with four changes to its side from last week's first leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Coach Carlo Ancelotti was missing suspended Marcelo in defense, while Luka Modric in midfield, and forwards Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema were injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Atletico was without the suspended Mario Suarez in midfield as the teams met for the eighth time this season - with Atletico unbeaten in the previous seven meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a rarely-seen tactical strategy, Ancelotti moved Ramos up to midfield, with Pepe behind in central defense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hernandez was given Benzema's role as sole striker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Madrid made a bright start and Ronaldo missed a good chance in the 13th minute when he shot just wide of the near post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Atletico's Jesus Gamez conceded a free kick in the 27th after a clumsy foul on Ronaldo but James Rodriguez could only send his shot over the crossbar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas made a good save from Gamez in the 29th in Atletico's first effort on goal, while Hernandez headed over the bar at the other end two minute later from a precise cross by Rodriguez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Oblak made yet another excellent save to deny Ronaldo just before the break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Madrid kept up the pressure after the restart and Hernandez missed a chance when, having controlled the ball with his back to goal, he spun around and unleashed a shot that flew just wide of the far post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Raphael Varane cleared what could have been a good chance for Atletico in the 59th and Madrid quickly responded with a header by Ramos which Oblak was able to smother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Casillas was forced to make a save in the 69th from midfielder Jorge ''Koke'' Resurreccion's header, while Hernandez missed his third chance on goal four minutes later as he shot across the goalmouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>However, the Mexican made no mistake in the 88th when he steered home Ronaldo's pass from the right side of the area.</td></tr>
