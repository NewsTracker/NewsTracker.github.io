<li>Boris Nemtsov's shaken girlfriend says she didn't see killer</li>
<li>MOSCOW - Boris Nemtsov's girlfriend has broken her public silence on the murder of the Russian opposition activist, saying she did not see the killer who gunned him down as they strolled across a bridge near the Kremlin.</li>
<li>Speaking largely without emotion in deadened monosyllables, Ukrainian fashion model Anna Duritskaya said she had little recollection of what happened in the moments after Nemtsov was shot dead on Friday night.</li>
<li>Nemtsov, 55, was shot several times and killed instantly, becoming the most prominent opposition figure to be murdered during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule.</li>
<li>Nemtsov had criticised Putin's annexation of Crimea and his support for pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine.</li>
