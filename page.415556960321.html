<h3>U.S. poll shows 40 per cent of iPhone owners would buy Apple Watch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>About 40 percent of adult Apple iPhone owners in the United States are interested in buying the company's new Apple Watch, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The high-tech smartwatch, which will range in price from $350 to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model, is Apple Inc's first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Owners of the iPhone are a particularly important market for Apple as it launches the new watch, which goes on sale April 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Because the watch needs an iPhone to work fully, analysts say the most likely pool of initial buyers will already have an Apple smartphone in their pockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said that with more than 100 million active iPhone users in the United States and closer to half a billion globally, the survey was "pretty encouraging" for a product that has not been seen in shops, even if was unclear how much of the interest would translate into purchases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andrew Hargreaves said it was not clear how many people wanted or needed a smartwatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But he expected Apple's cache and marketing might to deliver strong initial sales of the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Winning Apple customers is more realistic at this point," said Hargreaves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The watch allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ipsos surveyed 2,469 Americans aged 18 and older online between March 9 and March 17 and found that 24 per cent expressed an interest in purchasing the Apple Watch, including 10 per cent of those describing themselves as "very interested."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The data was weighted to reflect the U.S. population and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Among the iPhone owners, 39 per cent were interested in purchasing the Apple watch, including 17 per cent describing themselves as very interested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There were 788 iPhone owners in the survey with a credibility interval of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Discussions about the watch have flooded online social media channels such as Twitter and Facebook since Apple held a splashy event in San Francisco on March 9 to showcase the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Social media chatter about the Apple watch was 15 per cent positive and 5 per cent negative in the week following Apple's event, according to an analysis that the firm Networked Insights conducted for Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The remaining 80 per cent was neutral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>By contrast, the social conversation for Apple's iPhone 6 during the same week was 5 percent positive and 0 per cent negative, according to the analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Among the conversations relating to the Apple watch during the one-week period, 5.8 per cent of the comments showed an intent to purchase, according to Networked Insights, which analyzes tweets, public Facebook posts and other sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Social comments about the iPhone 6, which has been on sale since September, showed a 2.9 per cent purchase intent during the same week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Apple is among several large tech companies looking to jumpstart a new market for "wearable" electronic devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>More than half of iPhone users in the Reuters/Ipsos survey believe that a smartwatch in the near future will be an essential gadget that's as common as the smartphone, whereas 44 per cent a broader poll of U.S. adults felt that way.</td></tr>

<h3>Budget 2015: Liberal Democrats to reveal 'Yellow Budget' with speech in Commons</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The unique statement from the Despatch Box had to be agreed with Commons Speaker John Bercow and could infuriate Labour for using government time to make a highly political speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It comes after the party claimed money-making measures outlined in the Budget proved the Liberal Democrats had a major impact on the announcements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lib Dem aides insisted that higher bank levies and crackdowns on tax evasion announced to raise revenue were all &#x201c;central&#x201d; policy areas for the party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They also claimed that the rise in the personal income tax allowance, extra funding for mental health and a freeze on fuel duty all came after sustained pressure from the Lib Dems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It comes with the party attempting to claim ownership over popular elements over the Budget as they struggle to get credit for announcements revealed by a Conservative Chancellor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Alexander was mocked in the Chamber by Ed Miliband after he intervened to defend the Coalition&#x2019;s devolution of new powers to Manchester, with the Labour leader attacking the party for governing with the Tories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Party tensions behind the scenes also surfaced yesterday when Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, claimed he would be leading the response to the Budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>&#x201c;If it's the response to the Budget tomorrow, I will be leading and I will be setting the tone of the debate,&#x201d; Mr Cable told LBC Radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Alexander also tried to force Ed Balls to agree to a three-way televised chancellors debate while the pair appeared on Sky News together after the Budget.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury stuck his hand out and pushed Mr Balls to agree to a three-way debate &#x2013; the same trick pulled by the Labour shadow chancellor with George Osborne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But Mr Balls refused, saying he preferred either a head-to-head debate with Mr Osborne or a debate with all parties.</td></tr>
