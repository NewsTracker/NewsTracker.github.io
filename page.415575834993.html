<h3>GoDaddy's IPO to value Web hosting company at $2.87 billion</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Including debt, the company could be valued at $4 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The IPO market has had a slow start this year compared with 2014 when U.S. IPOs raised about $93 billion, the highest since 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Only two technology companies have gone public this year including online data storage provider Box Inc, whose shares have dropped about 27 percent since the company's market debut in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>IPO analysts expect GoDaddy, which manages about a fifth of the world's Internet domains, to fare better than Box due to demand for stock offerings from well-established brands with steady revenue streams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"GoDaddy is a much more seasoned company than Box," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPO investment firm IPOX Schuster LLC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>GoDaddy's offering of 22 million class A shares is expected to be priced between $17 and $19 per share, and raise up to $418 million, the company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Internet domain registrar, many of whose Super Bowl advertisements featured race car driver Danica Patrick, had filed to go public in 2006.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It later withdrew, citing unfavorable market conditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The company, known for ads that feature scantily clad women, was founded in 1997 and in 2011 was acquired by a private equity consortium led by KKR & Co LP and Silver Lake Partners LP for $2.25 billion, including debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It has since expanded from its roots in Internet domains to provide services to small and medium-sized businesses such as website building and web hosting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After the offering, KKR's class A share stake will fall to 23.9 percent from 27.9 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The private equity firm would continue to hold 20.9 percent of GoDaddy's class B shares.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Founder Bob Parsons, who stepped down as executive chairman in June, will hold 40 percent of GoDaddy's class B shares and nearly 24 percent of class A shares after the offering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The company, which serves 12.7 million customers, is led by Blake Irving, who was Yahoo Inc's chief product officer from 2010 to 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>GoDaddy's revenue rose 22.7 percent to $1.4 billion in the year ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Net loss narrowed to $143.3 million from $200 million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The company's shares are expected to list on the New York Stock Exchange under "GDDY".</td></tr>
