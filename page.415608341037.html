<h3>Obama steps up Iran charm offensive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the last week, both President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama have taken time to recognize Nowruz, the Persian New Year, as has Secretary of State John Kerry, who on Friday morning sent condolences to the Iranian president over his mother's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Obama used his annual Nowruz message, which was released Thursday evening, to implore the Iranian people to "speak up for the future we seek."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"A nuclear deal now can help open the door to a brighter future for you - the Iranian people, who, as heirs to a great civilization, have so much to give to the world," Obama said in video released by the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Kerry, who is taking the lead in the international talks over Iran's nuclear program, made a goodwill gesture of his own on Friday morning, expressing his condolences to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani over the death of his mother, Sakineh Peivandi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We share in his grief and that of his brother, Presidential Special Advisor Hossein Fereydoun, who has been participating in the talks in Lausanne, and we keep their family in our thoughts," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kerry said the timing of the death would be especially difficult for Rouhani's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Such a loss is especially hard coming on the eve of Nowruz, traditionally a time when families gather together in joy and hope."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The messages from Kerry and Obama come on the heels of a Nowruz celebration at the White House last weekend that featured a performance from a dance troupe and a Haft Seen display that is central to the holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was the second Nowruz event held during the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"One of my favorite things about the White House is how it is truly the people's house: a house that reflects the diversity of culture and traditions that make us who we are as a country," Michelle Obama said at the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"And Nowruz is one of those traditions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While previous administrations have recognized Nowruz, the outreach shows how much relations between Iran and the United States have changed since Rouhani, who the White House views as more moderate than his predecessors, took office in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The thaw in relations could lead to a nuclear agreement as soon as the end of this month, the self-imposed deadline for reaching a framework for an accord that could serve as a cornerstone of Obama's second-term legacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Negotiators are reportedly working with a draft of a deal that would require Iran to reduce its centrifuge capacity by about 40 percent in return for the lifting of economic sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Though the administration has said it does not want to extend the talks, Kerry has indicated that an extension would be possible - but only if a draft of the deal is reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Still, as warm as the White House has been to the Iranians in recent weeks, it has issued harsher pronouncements as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Less than half an hour after Kerry offered his condolences to Rouhani on Friday, the president issued a statement calling for the release of three Americans in Iranian custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Invoking the spirit of Nowruz, Obama called on the Iranians to release Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini and Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"It is especially painful that on a holiday centered on ridding one's self of the difficulties of the past year, Jason's mother and family will continue to carry the heavy burden of concern regarding Jason's health and well-being into the new year," he said of Rezaian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The president also asked the Iranians to help locate Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared while in Iran in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Washington Post reported in 2013 that Levinson had in fact been in the country as part of a rogue mission for the CIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>An official from the Treasury Department this week said that the administration is prepared to enact new economic sanctions against Iran if the talks fail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The White House's carrot-and-stick approach highlights not only the high-wire diplomacy being undertaken by negotiators in Switzerland, but also the increasing pressure from Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Republicans and many Democrats are deeply skeptical of Iran's intentions, with some fearing Obama will strike a "bad deal" that will leave Tehran with the capacity to build a nuclear bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Republicans have said that they will pursue additional sanctions against Iran, and Democrats have indicated they will not fight that effort once the end-of-March negotiating deadline passes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"It's time to tell the American people the truth. These talks are not going to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, from getting a nuclear weapon," Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in a statement Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"The Obama administration is circumventing the will of the American people, who do not support this deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Negotiators for Iran are facing political pressures as well, with hard-liners in their country reportedly arguing all economic sanctions against the country should be lifted as soon as a deal is struck - a condition the White House has said it will not accept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>With so many obstacles to a deal, it remains to be seen whether the administration's displays of goodwill will help move the diplomatic talks along.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Obama, in his video message, struck a hopeful tone, saying it's time for the U.S. and Iran to "seize this moment and the possibilities that can bloom in this new season."</td></tr>

<h3>Egypt, Emirati developers tout nebulous plan for new capital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Of the projects unveiled at the corporate jamboree that was Egypt's economic conference last weekend, "The Capital Cairo" is the biggest and least transparent endeavor, the latest mega-project ordered by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to kick-start an ailing economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There will be leafy mixed-use neighborhoods, housing for up to 7 million people, 2,000 schools, shopping malls, solar energy farms, efficient public transport, skyscrapers, a million new jobs and even a central park more than twice the size of New York City's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's everything missing from Egypt today - with a price tag of up to $80 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For urban planners, the project - described as "a dream of what could become reality" - is a mystery, hastily conceived with no concrete information on funding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Questions stick out over the actual demand for so many units, who will build required infrastructure and how to attract a diverse cross-section of society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Is a flashy Dubai-style city feasible in impoverished Egypt?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"No one's looked at it on any serious scale ... It is more like a scripted media event than a serious proposal, reflecting the current government's obsession with foreign, Gulf investments somehow coming to Egypt's rescue," said Cairo-based urban planner David Sims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Real estate is now considered the engine of Egypt's growth and what better way to stimulate it, in spite of the dismal record of new desert towns to date, than to proclaim a colossal new capital?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Crowds flocked to a scale model of the city during the conference in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, where companies and states committed $36 billion in investments and billions more in preliminary agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In his closing remarks, el-Sissi said he was "in a hurry" to see the new capital built and urged work done faster than the original 10-year timeframe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Peopling the desert with new cities has been an obsession of successive presidents in the Arab world's most populous country, but after decades of work and billions spent, occupancy rates are a fraction of original forecasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Drawing Egyptians to new sites has been a major challenge, with high prices, lack of infrastructure, and few jobs in the areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>All that will change with the new project, initiators say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The new plan falls under the auspices of the Housing Ministry and will be built by an Emirati-led fund called Capital City Partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Founding partner Mohamed Alabbar said clear profit incentives will encourage the private sector to lead the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Alabbar is chairman of Emaar Properties, the Emirati real estate developer behind large-scale projects like the record-breaking Burj Khalifa skyscraper and Downtown Dubai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"If you really want growth, if you want a great percentage of return, then this is the place in the Middle East ... For us as businessmen, the numbers make sense," he said in Sharm el-Sheikh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I like to do big things in big countries where I know the economy and the people, and I know how eager the government (is) to move forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"In Egypt, I'll bite any risk any day," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Others wonder if Egypt, a country with mass illiteracy, crushing poverty and tiny individual wealth compared to the energy-rich Emirates, is ready for the swank Dubai model of "world-class lifestyle" put forward by the man who built the world's first Armani Hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Let's say this does happen in seven years as the government wants. That's about 150,000 housing units per year, the same figure of what's currently being built annually in the whole country," urban policy researcher Yahia Shawkat said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"So where is the demand going to come from?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Organizers of the project haven't revealed funding or partnership details, and requests for information went unanswered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A Housing Ministry official who wasn't authorized to release information and spoke anonymously said a master plan would be "released in July or August, God willing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>El-Watan newspaper, close to the government, reported the contract would be signed before September with execution beginning in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Citing an unnamed government official, it said the state would hold 20 percent of the shares in the company behind the project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The allure of mega projects as a way to fix the economy is clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Growth hovers around two percent, far from its all-time high of seven percent before the 2011 popular uprising that ousted longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Unemployment stands around 13 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Since el-Sissi overthrew Mubarak's elected but divisive successor Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, Gulf allies and Brotherhood enemies Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have stepped in with more than $30 billion in aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The alliance may help explain Cairo's attraction to their model of fast-paced developments on previously barren land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But in the absence of a parliament since 2012, the government's vision for a new capital appears to have been made unilaterally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"This is a very classic kind of developer-speak where they get public land and then start studies and consultation with the public after the fact. It's a purely speculative kind of real estate exercise, opposed to what's really needed - a structure of dialogue with people," Shawkat said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>El-Sissi's personal engagement in the project coupled with the sheer size of possible Gulf investments make it likely to go ahead in some form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The question now is how much the state will pay for infrastructure upgrades, or whether it can persuade private developers to pitch in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Egypt is facing a housing shortage and serious population growth pressures, so the move to meet that demand in new urban areas outside of Cairo is a good idea," Cairo-based urban planner Josh Drake said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But he raised concerns about the execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"The companies will be interested in quick money by selling units, but when it comes to infrastructure and schools, community facilities and open spaces - things that cost money and have little return - they'll probably be avoiding those costs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>FILE - In this Saturday, March 14, 2015 file photo, a model of a planned new capital for Egypt is on display at an economic conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It's a monumental, ambitious project: An eco-friendly city the size of Singapore in the desert outside Cairo to serve as a new capital, with skyscrapers and a park more than twice the size of New York's Central Park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But urban planners and real estate experts say the plans remain a mystery and are skeptical it can or should be done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>FILE - In this Sunday, March 15, 2015 file photo, a model of a planned new capital for Egypt, that in its first phase would cost $45 billion and take up to seven years to complete, is on display at the Egyptian Economic Development Conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.</td></tr>
