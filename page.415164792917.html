<h3>US-Israel ties sorely tested as Netanyahu's Congress speech draws near</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington: A day before Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial address to the United States Congress, the Israeli prime minister and US President Barack Obama have traded barbs in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a speech to 16,000 members of AIPAC, America's largest pro-Israel lobby group, that had the air of a political rally early on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said that he meant no disrespect to Mr Obama, but insisted a negotiated settlement with Iran over its nuclear program would pose an existential threat to Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Later Mr Obama told Reuters that while he had no personal issue with Mr Netanyahu, the US had its own policymaking process, adding that Mr Netanyahu's warnings over preliminary agreements with Iran had proved unfounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Netanyahu believes the US should lead increased world sanctions to force Iran to give up its program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Obama believes that only a negotiated settlement leaving Iran some peaceful nuclear capacity can ensure Iran does not pursue its weapons program in secret.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Obama has made it clear he considers a settlement with Iran to be a top priority of the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The President left it to National Security Adviser Susan Rice to explain in detail to the AIPAC conference why Mr Obama believes his path is surer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At times the crowd's cheers for Dr Rice's address veered close to jeers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I know some would argue we should impose sanctions and just walk away, but let's remember - " she said, prompting overwhelming applause that forced her to pause before going on to say " - my friends, let's remember that sanctions have never stopped Iran from advancing its program."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She warned against Israel demanding "unreasonable and unachievable outcomes" with Iran, saying that "no one can make Iran unlearn the scientific and nuclear expertise it already possesses".</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If we insist on no enrichment, our partners will abandon us. Simply put, that is not a viable nor obtainable negotiating position," Dr Rice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In his interview with Reuters Mr Obama said again that the US would accept no deal before a bad deal, and that any deal would include a 12-month "breakout point".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That is, Iran's technology would be withheld to the point where it needed at least a year to develop a bomb from the moment it broke agreements, giving the international community time to either reintroduce sanctions or mount a military assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>During his speech to AIPAC, Mr Netanyahu said that while US leaders were concerned for American safety, Israel's were forced to fear for their nation's very survival, and this perspective had lead to disagreements between the two nations in the past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But he said the relationship - more like family than friends - had survived and grown stronger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Though Mr Obama agreed - at least to the point of saying that the discord between the leaders is not "permanently destructive" - observers agree that Mr Netanyahu's speech has caused real damage to the relationship between the nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The decision by the House Speaker, the Republican John Boehner, to extend an invitation to Mr Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress has been described as everything from a serious breach of protocol to a breach of the Constitution, which grants responsibility for foreign affairs solely to the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's decision to accept the invitation has provoked anger in both the US and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Some have suggested that Mr Netanyahu, running for re-election in a fortnight, has risked angering his nation's key ally for domestic political gain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Around 30 Democrats, including US Vice-President Joe Biden, who also serves as the president of Senate, have decided not to attend Mr Netanyahu's speech on Tuesday morning in Washington, DC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The fallout has been significant and even ugly at times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Last week Dr Rice told an interviewer: "What has happened over the last several weeks - by virtue of the invitation that was issued by the Speaker and the acceptance of it by Prime Minister Netanyahu two weeks in advance of his election - is that on both sides, there has now been injected a degree of partisanship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It's destructive of the fabric of the relationship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In response over the weekend, the controversial reality TV figure and failed Republican candidate Rabbi Shmuley Boteach took out a full-page advertisement depicting Dr Rice surrounded by skulls and declaring she was blind to genocide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>American Jewish groups almost unanimously condemned the ad, calling it "revolting", "grotesque" and a "sinister slur".</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Marshall Wittman, a spokesman for AIPAC, said: "Ad hominem attacks should have no place in our discourse."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But one conservative US radio host said those members of Congress who have decided not to attend should be hanged in front of the Capitol.</td></tr>

<h3>John Oliver, the British comedian spurring America to action</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Oliver was the first name on most people's lips last month when Stewart sent his legions of fans into mourning after announcing he was stepping down from the satirical Comedy Central show after nearly two decades as host.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The prospect of the 37-year-old Birmingham native sliding into Stewart's chair receded however when HBO swiftly announced it was renewing his own show, "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver", for two more years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Yet Oliver's role in galvanizing American opinion over the once-arcane concept of access to the Internet was in the best traditions of Stewart, a master of using biting humor to unravel complex questions of the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Oliver's 13-minute segment on "net neutrality" last year, in which he exhorted viewers to deluge the US Federal Communications Commission forum with objections, is widely credited with crashing the FCC's comments page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Within 24 hours of Oliver's rallying cry, more than 45,000 comments on net neutrality had been posted on the FCC forum, according to the Washington Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Fast forward to last Thursday, and the FCC acquiesced, approving landmark rules to prevent broadband providers from separating online traffic into two unequal lanes, which would allow them to charge fees for better access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Many people gave credit to Oliver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The democratic support for this decision relied heavily on citing the millions of citizen comments submitted via the FCC's website, and those comments were overwhelmingly inspired, directly and indirectly, by Oliver's advocacy," Aram Sinnreich, a professor of journalism at Rutgers University, told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Oliver, whose show just kicked off its second season, gained massive popularity in 2013 when he stood in for Stewart to guest host "The Daily Show" while the Comedy Central comedian took a leave of absence to make a movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I'll do anything for him, whether it's hosting this show or disposing of a body," Oliver said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>HBO came to Oliver with the 30-minute show, which has only grown in success since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Stationed at a desk, wearing a standard suit and tie plus dark-rimmed glasses, Oliver has pilloried, in a series of clear, well-documented and wonderfully funny arguments, vitamins, the militarization of American police, FIFA soccer corruption and the bikini-clad women of Sports Illustrated magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Time magazine recently ran an article titled: "How the 'John Oliver Effect' Is Having a Real-Life Impact."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It credits Oliver, in part or whole, with a list of accomplishments including increased donations to an association of women engineers, a proposed bill in the US state of Washington to allow online video comments on new legislation, and Attorney General Eric Holder's announcement that he will enact major limitations on a controversial confiscation law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Stewart created the opening, and Oliver has made a significant contribution by expanding it even further," said Lance Strate, a communication and media studies professor at Fordham University in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Both Stewart and Oliver are doing the job that the press ought to be doing, acting as a fourth estate and holding politicians, corporations and the new media themselves accountable for their actions and statements," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Furthermore, said Paul Booth, a professor of media and cinema studies at DePaul University in Chicago, "many Americans do love the English sense of humor."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Oliver definitely embodies some of the best traits of British humor -- he's sly, witty, charming, able to poke fun at himself, a bit awkward," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Cambridge-educated, Oliver began his career in Britain before hopping the pond to audition in 2006 for "The Daily Show," becoming its "British correspondent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Married to an American, Oliver claims to love reality TV and hate massages.</td></tr>
