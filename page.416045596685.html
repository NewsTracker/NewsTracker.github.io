<h3>Busted! Guerrilla artists sneak giant sculpture of Edward Snowden's head into Brooklyn park only to have it pulled down hours later by city workers</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A 4-foot-high, 100-pound sculpted bust of the infamous NSA whistleblower now exiled in Russia was sneaked into Brooklyn's Fort Greene Park in the pre-dawn hours Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Animal New York, a city news website that first reported the incident, said the mysterious perpetrators were a trio of guerrilla artists - admirers of the former government contractor who had leaked thousands of pages of classified information from the National Security Agency detailing a massive domestic spying program to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The activists hoisted the unsanctioned bust to the top of a Revolutionary War memorial, adding his name to a column, according to Animal New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The website says the group allowed it to document installation of the statue on the condition that it not reveal the identities of the artists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Snowden's artistic appearance was short-lived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At daybreak, police said city parks officials ordered the sculpted Snowden removed from the top of Prison Ship Martyrs Monument, which honors the 11,500 patriots who died aboard British prison ships during the Revolutionary War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And by evening, his bust was being held at Brooklyn's 88th Precinct pending an investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The idea for the tribute was conceived by two New York City-based artists, joined by a West Coast sculptor, Animal New York said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a statement to the online outlet, they said they had 'updated' the memorial to American POWs who died during the war for independence 'to highlight those who sacrifice their safety in the fight against modern-day tyrannies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'It would be a dishonor to those memorialized here to not laud those who protect the ideals they fought for, as Edward Snowden has by bringing the NSA's 4th-Amendment-violating surveillance programs to light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'Our goal is to bring a renewed vitality to the space and prompt even more visitors to ponder the sacrifices made for their freedoms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Following Edward Snowden's well-documented defection to Russia in 2013, the 31-year-old whistle-blower has emerged as a highly polarizing figure in the national debate, with the Obama administration and right-wing politicians labeling him a traitor, and those on the left praising him for exposing broad civil rights violations by the intelligence community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'If you look at history, the people we honor with statues now - certainly the people rebelling against the British rules - were criminals one day,' the creators of the Snowden bust told Mashable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>'Now they're heroes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It took the anonymous artists six months to sculpt, mold and cast Snowden's likeness worth $30,000 out of a high-quality plaster-like material called hydrocal, and then have it shipped from the West Coast to New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The color and style of the artwork matched the rest of the monument so well that many people walking their dogs in the park early Monday morning did not raise an eyebrow at the sight of the notorious whistle-blower's face staring down at them from the top of a pillar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>By noon, New York City parks officials wrapped the bronze-colored bust with a blue tarp and yanked it from the pedestal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The block letters spelling Snowdon's name below a brass eagle were also removed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Workers had to use a pulley to lower the illicit artwork to the ground and load onto a truck to haul it away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>'The erection of any unapproved structure or artwork in a city park is illegal,' the parks department said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The guerrilla artists apparently knew going in that their bold tribute to Snowden was not long for this world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>'We look at this as a gift to the city, but, you know, gifts are sometimes not accepted,' one of the activist said in a video about the project titled Prison Ship Martyrs Monument 2.0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The installation of the sculpture came hours after HBO aired John Oliver's interview with Edward Snowden on the comedian's show Last Week Tonight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>'I do miss my country,' he told Oliver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>'I do miss my home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As for Snowden's plaster likeness, it may not be the last time that it pops up in a public space.</td></tr>
