<h3>Facebook 'friends' icon gets gender shakeup</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook icons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The old one, with the female in the background, is in light blue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A subtle change to Facebook's ubiquitous "Friends" icon makes a not-so-subtle nod toward gender equality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Not too long into Facebook designer manager Caitlin Winner's tenure at Facebook, she realized the silhouette of the man in the icon was more prominently placed than the silhouette of the woman and, adding fire to the flame, the woman's shoulder had been chipped away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>This glitch in the design was something "worth getting upset about," Winner wrote on a Medium post Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Winner did not appreciate the symbolism suggested by the male's placement, so she took it upon herself to amend the design.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"As a woman educated at a women's college, it was hard not to read into the symbolism of the current icon; the woman was quite literally in the shadow of the man, she was not in a position to lean in," Winner wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The changes have been made to the tiny icons that users see in the upper right-hand corner of the social media site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Previously, the man was positioned in front of the woman -- and now, with the updated design, the male is in the back and the two silhouettes are more similar in size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Winner also fixed the chip in the woman's silhouette and updated her hairdo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And she rearranged the 'groups' icon, which had featured two men and one woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The woman had been in the back in this icon, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The new one places the woman in front, with two different silhouettes in the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"As a result of this project, I'm on high alert for symbolism," Winner wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I try to question all icons, especially those that feel the most familiar. For example, is the briefcase they best symbol for 'work'? ... What are other ways that ''work' could be symbolized and what would those icons evoke for the majority of people on Earth?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This icon update comes a few weeks after the social media company subtly tweaked its logo to make it more aesthetically pleasing on mobile platforms.</td></tr>
