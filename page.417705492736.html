<h3>Asia stocks drift as Greece dampens impact of strong US data</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Asian stock markets were little changed Friday as lack of progress in bailout negotiations between Greece and its creditors dampened the positive impulse from upbeat U.S. retail and jobs data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 added less than 0.1 percent to 20,393.32 and South Korea's benchmark inched up 0.1 percent to 2,058.24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5 percent to 27,042.00 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged down 0.2 percent to 5,545.40.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Stocks in Shanghai and Singapore were nearly flat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>IMF WALKOUT: The International Monetary Fund said there was no progress in recent Greece bailout talks and pulled negotiators out of the meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The move increases pressure on Athens to compromise but markets were worried that the outstanding differences between Greece and its creditors would lead to the country defaulting on its debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A possible consequence of a default is Greece leaving the euro currency bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The country faces a June 30 deadline for a debt payment and a meeting of the eurozone's finance ministers, known as the eurogroup, from June 18-19 may be a decisive milestone in the saga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>ANALYST'S TAKE: "The fact the IMF walked out of talks and flew straight back to the States doesn't help sentiment or give you confidence a deal will be done," said Evan Lucas, a market strategist at IG.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This will get messy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>BRIGHT USA: Retail sales climbed 1.2 percent in May, the Commerce Department said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The retail report showed that Americans ramped up their spending on autos, building materials and clothing, a sign that strong job growth is starting to boost sales at stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, yet remains at a historically low level underlining a healthier job market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose for a second day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The S&P 500 climbed 3.66 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,108.86.</td></tr>
