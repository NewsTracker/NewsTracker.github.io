<h3>Egypt opens border with Gaza for first time in 2 months</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) " Egypt has opened its border with the Gaza Strip for the first time in two months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Rafah border crossing opened Monday for four days, allowing Palestinians to travel in both directions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Crossing director Khaled al-Shaer says some 20,000 people have applied to exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gazans seeking medical care and students are among those expected to cross.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rafah is Gaza's only gateway to the outside world with no Israeli control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Egypt has kept it mostly closed since the militant Hamas group seized control of the coastal strip in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The closure worsened after Egypt's military ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood member, in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hamas is an offshoot of the Brotherhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The crossing has been opened for a total of just 15 days this year.</td></tr>
