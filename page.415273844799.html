<h3>Egypt executes 'supporter' of Muslim Brotherhood</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt has executed a convict for a murder committed during riots in mid-2013, the first death sentence carried out against a supporter of the banned Muslim Brotherhood under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, according to the Interior Ministry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a statement on its Facebook page on Saturday, the ministry said that Mahmoud Hassan Ramadan Abdel-Nabi had been hanged for an incident where children were thrown from a building during protests in 2013 against the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Security sources have described Ramadan as a "radical Islamist" who is not officially a Brotherhood member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Former army chief Sisi oversaw the army's removal of the Brotherhood's Morsi, elected president following the 2011 uprising, in July 2013 following mass protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Egyptian courts have sentenced hundreds of alleged Brotherhood supporters to death in recent months, many in mass trials condemned by foreign governments and rights groups as violating international law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Saturday's execution came a month after Egypt's high court upheld the death sentence against Ramadan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Most of the other death sentences are still under review in a complex system of legal appeals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In one of the most dramatic scenes of the upheaval following Morsi's fall captured on video, Ramadan threw someone off a rooftop during clashes in Alexandria's Sidi Gaber district.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>An al-Qaeda flag was seen tucked into the back of Ramadan's trousers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fifty-seven others were sentenced to 15-25 years in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Brotherhood, which says it is committed to peaceful activism, has accused the military of staging a coup and curbing freedoms won in the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
