<h3>Two officers shot outside Ferguson police HQ</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two police officers were shot during a protest outside the Ferguson, Missouri police headquarters early on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This comes hours after the city's police chief Thomas Jackson quit following a damning justice report into his department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters that a 41-year-old officer from his department was struck in the shoulder and a 32-year-old officer from the nearby Webster Groves Police Department was hit in the face around midnight as the crowd was starting to break up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said he did not know the conditions of the officers, whom he did not identify, but said they were both conscious and being treated at a local hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"These police officers were standing there and they were shot, just because they were police officers," Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The St. Louis County Police Department Twitter account had earlier said both of the shot officers were from their department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A few dozen demonstrators scrambled following the sound of gunfire around midnight, with some screaming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"They hit a cop," according to a Reuters photographer at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Protesters had called for Jackson's removal since the fatal shooting of unarmed black 18-year-old Michael Brown by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on August 9, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The killing triggered nationwide protests and drew scrutiny to police use of deadly force, especially against black men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Neither a grand jury nor the federal probe led to charges against Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Jackson's departure was the latest in a string of officials who have stepped down following a scathing report from the US Justice Department that found widespread racially biased abuses in the city's police department and municipal court.</td></tr>
