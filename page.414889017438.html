<h3>Fighting rages in east Ukraine despite bid to revive truce</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Western nations are refusing to give up on a peace deal brokered by France and Germany even though the rebels disavowed it to seize the important railway hub of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shelling continued near that town on Thursday, and local officials in government-held territory said rebels had also fired mortar bombs at another town further south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kiev fears they are massing for an assault near the major port of Mariupol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Thousands of weary and demoralised soldiers withdrew from Debaltseve on Wednesday in one of the worst defeats suffered by Kiev during 10 months of fighting in which more than 5000 people have been killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>European and US officials have expressed hope that the ceasefire will hold now that the rebels, fighting for territory Russian President Vladimir Putin has called "New Russia", have achieved their immediate goal of taking Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But Reuters correspondents outside the rebel-held town of Vuhlehirsk said artillery shells were still falling on nearby Debaltseve, though with less intensity than earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Reporters in the main rebel stronghold of Donetsk said there was also shelling in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kiev's biggest fear is of a rebel assault on Mariupol, a port of 500,000 people and by far the biggest government-held city in the two rebellious eastern provinces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Right now there are mortar attacks on Shyrokine," a military spokesman said, referring to a village about 30 kilometres east of Mariupol, along the coast of the Sea of Azov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There is no attempt to seize our positions up to now. The rebels are bringing up reserves," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Wednesday's withdrawal was a humiliating defeat for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who faces an economic crisis as well as the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Images of captured Ukrainian soldiers were beamed across Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said 13 servicemen were killed and 157 wounded during the withdrawal and a further 82 were still missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ninety-three were taken prisoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"There are no words to describe it. Along the entire way we were blanketed with shots, wherever there were trees they fired at us from machine guns and grenade launchers. They used everything," Vadim, a soldier from Ukraine's 30th brigade, told Reuters in Artemivsk, a government-held town north of Debaltseve where the soldiers assembled after they withdrew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some blamed commanders for leaving them trapped in the besieged town after it became impossible to resupply it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It felt like we'd been abandoned or betrayed," said a soldier from Ukraine's 55th brigade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The rebels have maintained that the ceasefire did not apply to Debaltseve, suggesting they may begin to observe it now that they have captured the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They have announced that they are pulling back heavy guns as required under the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The leaders of Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia agreed in a telephone call to make a new attempt to enforce the ceasefire and ensure other terms of the peace deal are implemented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The White House said it was "deeply troubled" by reports of fighting and NATO's top military commander, US Air Force General Philip Breedlove, said he did not think the truce had ever even begun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It is a ceasefire in name only," General Breedlove said during a visit to Kosovo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Western countries said Russia is behind the rebel advance, having deployed thousands of troops with advanced weaponry into eastern Ukraine to fight on the separatists' behalf, though Moscow denied this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Putin posed a "real and present danger" to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and NATO was getting ready to repel any aggression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Vice-President of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis said "Russia is looking to redraw Europe's 21st century borders by force".</td></tr>

<h3>Leaders renew backing for Ukraine truce</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine have promised to start exchanging prisoners, in a possible boost to a ceasefire that the US accuses separatists of repeatedly violating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A rebel official for human rights, Daria Morozova, said an initial exchange of prisoners with the Ukrainian side would take place on Saturday, the Interfax news agency reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There was no immediate confirmation from Kiev, but such a swap was agreed by both sides as part of the truce forged last week in the Belarus capital Minsk under European mediation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That UN-backed truce, though, has been left in tatters by repeated violations since it came into effect last Sunday, with each side regularly accusing the other of ceasefire breaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The worst transgression was a rebel assault on Debaltseve, a strategic transport hub linking the insurgents' two strongholds of Donetsk and Lugansk, from where 2500 government soldiers fled on Wednesday and scores of others were taken prisoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kiev said 13 troops were killed in the withdrawal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the rebels, now in control of the town, said they found the bodies of 57 soldiers - as well as many abandoned weapons, including 28 tanks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, whose government is being criticised for incompetence over the rout, accused Russia of ordering the Debaltseve offensive and called for international peacekeepers to be deployed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>However, in a phone call on Thursday between Poroshenko, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Russian President Vladimir Putin, that appeal was ignored and the leaders agreed that the ceasefire should be applied regardless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This is a critical moment for Ukraine," warned Ivica Dacic, the head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe which is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a statement on Friday, Dacic urged an immediate halt to hostilities, saying he was "concerned that the continuous breaches of the ceasefire ... may lead to uncontrolled violence".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Significantly, there has been no confirmation of either side pulling back heavy weapons from the front line, which was meant to begin Tuesday and be completed by March 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Merkel and Hollande were to discuss the situation further in a meeting in Paris later on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The US, which said early this month it was mulling providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, said the pro-Russian separatists had broken the ceasefire "more than 250 times".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The United States condemns continuing attacks by Russia-backed separatists in and around Debaltseve, Mariupol and other locations in eastern Ukraine which violate the ceasefire and flout the Minsk agreements," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters in Washington on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Psaki called on Russia and the separatists "to stop their attacks immediately, withdraw heavy weapons, halt the flow of fighters and equipment from Russia into Ukraine".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Moscow denies directly supporting the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile, a scathing report from a British parliamentary committee said Britain and the EU were "guilty of sleepwalking into this crisis" by failing to understand Russian motives and aims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The lack of robust analytical capacity, in both the UK and the EU, effectively led to a catastrophic misreading of the (Russian) mood in the run-up to the crisis," said Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of the EU committee in Britain's House of Lords.</td></tr>
