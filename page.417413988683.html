<h3>Egypt's rights agency says 2,600 killed after Morsi ouster</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - The head of Egypt's state human rights agency says 2,600 people, nearly half of them supporters of the nation's ousted president, were killed in violence over an 18-month period starting June 30, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mohammed Fayeq, head of the National Council for Human Rights, told reporters Sunday that 700 policemen and 550 civilians were also killed in the period between June 30, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The period roughly corresponds to the July 3, 2013 military ouster of the Islamist Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, and the subsequent crackdown on members of his now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in a series of clashes with security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At least 600 Morsi supporters were killed on a single day when security forces broke up two Cairo-based sit-in protests on Aug. 14, 2013.</td></tr>
