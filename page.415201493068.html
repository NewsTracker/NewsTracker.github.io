<h3>Army also wants peace with India, says Pakistan's ambassador</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DW: Relations within the regional triangle, Pakistan-Afghanistan-India, have not been at their best in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But now we see visits by Pakistan's Army chief to Kabul and by the Indian Foreign Secretary to Islamabad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Is this the beginning of a new era of trustful cooperation?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>S. H.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Javed: The changes that have been taking place both in the region and relations between Pakistan, Afghanistan and India are far-reaching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Talks between the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan hadn't taken place for long time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But these discussions should take place as they are the best way to ensure regional peace and security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Pakistan and India should be looking towards the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Furthermore, we wish that no country in South Asia should strive for hegemony as this creates problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Do you view the Indian Foreign Secretary's recent visit to Pakistan as a positive sign from New Delhi?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In my opinion, this should have happened much earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A lot of precious time was lost when contact was suspended last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>When Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif went to India to take part in the oath-taking ceremony of his counterpart Narendra Modi, it was a gesture of goodwill from Islamabad to the new Indian political leadership.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Moreover, PM Sharif showed his willingness to improve bilateral relations, particularly as both countries are trying to push their economic growth agendas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Which areas of cooperation with India could you identify?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There are numerous areas - the sky is the limit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>If India's leadership and the people extended a friendly hand towards Pakistan, our leadership and people would extend two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>We would react to friendship with friendship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>To this end, it is vital that all problems between the two neighbors are resolved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Analysts believe there are differences between the Nawaz Sharif government and the Pakistani Army regarding engaging in talks with India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Does the Pakistani Army really support peace talks with New Delhi?</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Pakistan trains Afghan soldiers: Enough to build trust?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ties between Afghanistan and Pakistan are beginning to thaw as a group of Afghan cadets has arrived in Islamabad to receive military training.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But Pakistan needs to do a lot more to win the Afghan trust, say experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>What is driving Pakistan's fuel crisis?</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Pakistan's latest energy crisis, a weeks-long petrol shortage, has brought parts of the nation to a standstill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Economist Daniel Martin speaks to DW about what's causing the shortage and what Islamabad can do about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>What prompted Pakistan to ban the Haqqani network?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Pakistan has finally decided to outlaw the militant Haqqani network, which has been responsible for attacks on foreign forces in Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Experts, however, say that Islamabad's move is unlikely to be implemented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>China and Pakistan have been described as "all weather friends," but the nature of their ties remains secretive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>DW talks to analyst Andrew Small, about some of the most sensitive aspects of this strategic relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Not only the Pakistani Army, but also the government, political leaders, political parties and the nation as a whole favor having good relations with India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>No pillar of power in Pakistan has any objection to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The Pakistani Army sees the benefits which a lasting regional peace would bring to South Asia, especially to Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>That is a point on which all pillars of power in Pakistan have a joint stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Can India and Pakistan bring about any improvement in their relations without solving the Kashmir issue first?</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The Jammu and Kashmir issue is an old conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>There are multiple UN resolutions which bind India, Pakistan and the international community to solve this problem jointly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>We have also tried many times in the past to leave the Jammu and Kashmir issue aside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But this could not be done, also because this conflict is not only between India and Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>The Kashmiri people also play a role.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>This is now an issue about the international community honoring the promises it made to the Kashmiri people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Without solving this conflict, any efforts to improve ties between Islamabad and New Delhi would remain incomplete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Considering the rise of Hindu nationalism in India and its stance towards minorities, do you think it presents a hurdle for New Delhi to have closer relations with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan?</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Things are not moving in the right direction in India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The basic existence and identity of the Indian state was defined to be secular 67 years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Today secularism is being pushed out of all areas there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Internationally, nothing is being said about this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Perhaps the world is more interested in India's size as a state or the total volume of its economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>But the Hindu nationalist agenda is not in India's own interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Pakistan comes later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The Hindu nationalists are a threat to India.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Moreover, their mantra of Pakistan becoming a so-called failed state is something they should get rid of.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law is something equally strongly criticized at home and abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Is there a chance to abolish or amend this law to stop its misuse, especially against minorities?</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The blasphemy issue in Pakistan is a critically important issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>This law was passed by a two-third majority in the federal parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>If you closely look at the cases in which people made use of this law, the accused also include many Muslims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>The blasphemy cases are not always against Christians or other minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>We are doing our best to stop the misuse of this law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>We are also investigating the potential abuse the law, and inquiring if people are misusing it for personal gains or to even settle individual animosities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Syed Hasan Javed is Pakistan's Ambassador to Germany.</td></tr>
