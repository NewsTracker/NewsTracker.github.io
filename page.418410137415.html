<h3>Matthews sticks with reeling Mavs after Jordan rejection (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DALLAS (AP) -- Mavericks owner Mark Cuban gave free agent guard Wesley Matthews an out after accepting the reality that DeAndre Jordan was spurning Dallas to re-sign with the Los Angeles Clippers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Matthews turned him down, deciding to stand by his agreement to sign with a franchise that could be reeling for a long time after the 6-foot-11 center's stunning reversal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''I can't print his exact response, but suffice it to say he is excited to play for our Mavs,'' Cuban wrote to fans on his Cyber Dust app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Matthews was the only winner on the Dallas side because of Jordan's switch, signing a max contract Thursday at four years and $70 million, or $17.5 million per season, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team wasn't releasing terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The 28-year-old Matthews was expected to make about $14 million per season after Jordan agreed to a four-year, $80 million max deal with Dallas last Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jordan changed his mind and stayed with the team that drafted him seven years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said Cuban alone would address free agency with reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The owner was asked about Jordan during an appearance at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum later Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''You had to say his name,'' Cuban said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Instead of celebrating the biggest free agent pickup in franchise history, the Mavericks are in their fourth straight summer of missing out on a big-name target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And that's all since Cuban chose salary cap flexibility over keeping key pieces of the franchise's first championship team in 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Mavericks made their first move at center since missing out on Jordan by trading for Milwaukee's Zaza Pachulia on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dallas gave up a future second-round pick and sees Pachulia as a starter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The 12-year veteran from the Republic of Georgia started 45 of his 73 games for the Bucks last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Dirk Nowitzki might be the one most affected by Jordan's reversal because the 37-year-old German is hoping for at least one more run at a title going into his 18th season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He has two years left on his contract, and can opt out after next season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The Mavericks, who haven't won a playoff series since that 2011 title, don't have a defensive anchor in the middle, a role filled by Tyson Chandler four years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Mavericks hoped to have Chandler, who returned in a trade last summer, as a backup plan if the pursuit of Jordan failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But the Dallas fan favorite committed to Phoenix early in free agency and made it official Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>While Matthews gives Dallas a solid shooting guard, the Mavericks were still looking for a starting point guard and eyeing Jeremy Lin as they waited to wrap up Jordan's deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Instead, Lin committed to Charlotte while the Jordan saga unfolded into the night Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Cuban said the former Texas A&M player never made contact with him after the Dallas owner traveled to Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Clippers coach Doc Rivers, one of those at Jordan's house to make sure he signed with Los Angeles, countered Thursday that it's up to the agent to contact a team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Small forward Chandler Parsons is now a headliner alongside Nowitzki, and can opt out of the final year of his three-year contract after next season as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Guards Devin Harris and Raymond Felton are under contract, and should be joined soon by J.J. Barea and first-round draft pick Justin Anderson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Potential role players in the frontcourt include Dwight Powell and three more who should soon sign soon - a pair of returnees in Charlie Villanueva and Richard Jefferson and Jeremy Evans, a free agent who spent his first five seasons in Utah.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>While Dallas whiffed on the likes of Deron Williams, Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony in each of the past three summers, none came close to picking the Mavericks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>And the team knew early enough to pursue other options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Jordan's reversal was different, and it compounded a problem the Mavericks brought on themselves in the failed trade for point guard Rajon Rondo last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Not only are two young potential cornerstones in Rondo and Jordan no longer options, but Dallas' first-round pick goes to Boston unless the Mavericks have a spot in the top seven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The gloom seemed to overshadow even the team's summer league practice Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Carlisle briefly addressed reporters as players scattered quickly while the coach was saying they wouldn't be allowed to answer questions about free agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>That left Carlisle with little to talk about other than Matthews, who tore an Achilles tendon with Portland in a game against Dallas in March and might not be ready for the start of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>''He was the first guy we talked to,'' Carlisle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>''He's very serious about not only his career but he's serious about winning and he had great interest in Dallas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Mavericks and their fans could be hurting for a while over a player who didn't follow through with one.</td></tr>
