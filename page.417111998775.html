<h3>Greek coast guard rescues 38 migrants off western coast</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - The Greek coast guard is searching for a boat believed to be carrying 45 migrants and to have run into trouble south of the small Ionian island of Antipaxoi, off the western coast of mainland Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two coast guard boats, a helicopter and one more boat sailing in the area were searching for the vessel Tuesday afternoon after one of those on board made a call requesting help, the coast guard said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was not immediately clear what problem the boat was experiencing or where those on board were from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Tens of thousands of migrants cross from the nearby Turkish coast into Greece each year, hoping to make their way to more prosperous European Union countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Others try to go overland through Macedonia, or attempt to sail to Italy.</td></tr>
