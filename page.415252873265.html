<h3>Apple to replace AT&T in Dow Jones industrial average</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In the Dow's elite club, Apple is in and AT&T is out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple will replace AT&T in the Dow Jones industrial average on March 19, the manager of the index announced early Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's not likely to impact the 30-stock index much, and has no effect on the fortunes of the two companies, but it's another victory of sorts for the popular and profitable iPhone giant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple will be joining the Dow Jones industrial average, an elite club of 30 major U.S. companies, on March 18, replacing AT&T.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Here's a look at the famous barometer of the U.S. stock market and how it works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The move cements Apple as "the gold standard of technology," says Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at FBR Research.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They've really become the modern day Wright Brothers of technology."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>S&P Dow Jones Indices, the index manager, said it's making the move in response to a planned stock split for Visa, another member of the 119-year old barometer of the stock market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After its four-to-one stock split, Visa will wind up with a lower price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>S&P said that would reduce the weight of the information technology sector in the Dow because Visa, a credit-card and payment-processing giant, counts as a tech stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Adding Apple will help balance out this reduction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>S&P Dow Jones Indices said the decision to fold in Apple won't alter the overall level of the index - which stood at 17,911 Friday afternoon, less than two percent below its all-time high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>S&P Dow Jones is casting the move as a sort of a housekeeping maneuver, a way to ensure that this most famous of stock-market barometers better reflects the U.S. economy and markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The switch was also not a reflection on its view of Apple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"This doesn't mean we like the stock, or don't like the stock, or something like that," David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones, told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>While the Dow change wasn't triggered by anything AT&T did, it comes at a challenging time for the phone giant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Its stock has risen just 3.6 percent in the past 12 months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That compares with an 11 percent gain in the S&P 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Apple, meanwhile, has jumped 68 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>To keep growing, AT&T has had to look beyond cellphones - to tablets and connected cars, for example.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Adding a tablet to a phone plan gets AT&T another $10 in monthly service fees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Dallas-based company is also trying to wean customers off equipment subsidies and shift them toward installment plans in which they ultimately pay full price for a phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In its most recent quarter, AT&T booked a loss due to one-time expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But its revenue rose 4 percent as it added 1.9 million subscribers, double the year-ago quarterly increase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>AT&T has bounced in and out of the blue chip average over the Dow's long history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It first entered in 1916 as American Telephone & Telegraph, joining Central Leather, Studebaker and other industrial giants in an elite club of 20 companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In recent times, AT&T was kicked out in 2004 only to return the following year when it merged with SBC Communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Created in 1896, the Dow is one of the oldest gauges of a stock wealth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>When it was created, Grover Cleveland was U.S. president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Companies like the Pacific Mail Steamship were counted among its ranks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The index only tracks 30 stocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Standard and Poor's 500, a rival gauge that reflects the performance of 500 stocks, is the one that professional investors watch most closely to see how their own portfolios are performing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>And ordinary investors haven't bothered much with the Dow either, judging from the money they've put into index funds that mimic its performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Investors have just $13.6 billion in 12 Dow-based index funds, according to Morningstar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>That compares with $4 trillion in 1,261 S&P indexes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Still, the Dow can't be dismissed as a relic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>It continues to be widely cited and isn't seen as wildly distorted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>One reason is that, for all its flaws, the Dow has largely mirrored the ups and downs of the much larger S&P 500.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>In the past 12 months, for instance, the Dow has risen 9.2 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The S&P 500 has climbed 10.8 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The last big Dow shake-up came in September 2013, when Goldman Sachs, Nike and Visa knocked out Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard.</td></tr>
