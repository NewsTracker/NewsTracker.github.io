<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DonnaMarie Douglas from Glasgow (right) and a friend lay flowers at the makeshift memorial on the beach in front of the Hotel Imperial Marhaba.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sousse: At a makeshift memorial on the site of last Friday's deadly attack, a steady stream of tourists and locals gathered to lay flowers and notes to remember the victims of Tunisia's worst ever terror attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>With their backs to the deep blue of the Mediterranean Sea, they faced a swathe of sun lounges that now sit mostly empty on the beach in front of the Hotel Imperial Marhaba where so many lost their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>DonnaMarie Douglas from Glasgow hugs a Tunisian local who came to express her solidarity with those who lost their lives in Friday's terror attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The hotel is now a crime scene, its gates from the beach padlocked, while a handful of guests who have chosen to continue their stay remain inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>One hotel worker says 25 people were left in the huge hotel which is now closed to the public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A small number of security personnel armed with semi-automatic weapons were guarding the beach at Port El Kantaoui north of Sousse, while police on horseback and quad bikes patrolled the area where Tunisian Seifeddine Rezgui gunned down 38 people, mostly foreign tourists, last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>There were reports that up to 10,000 of the 20,000 Britons holidaying in Tunisia have left since Friday's attack, with tour companies arranging extra flights for tourists desperate to flee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Security patrol Marhaba beach on Monday at the scene where 38 people were killed in a terrorist attack last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Some, however, chose to stay, out of a sense of solidarity with Tunisian staff at the resorts and because the chaos of thousands of people trying to leave felt like more stress for holiday-makers who have already endured a frightening few days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Our family are asking us to come home, but we've decided to stay here until we're due to fly back - I can see no reason to get caught up in the rush at the airport, says DonnaMarie Douglas, from Glasgow, carrying a small bunch of flowers to lay at the memorial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Sadly, we know that this could happen anywhere," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It happened in London."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A member of Tunisia's special forces inspects the beachside of the Imperial Marhaba resort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Staff at her hotel - a few doors down the beach front from the Imperial Marhaba - said their bookings for August, the peak of the European and Tunisian summer holiday season, have all been cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They are really worried about what's going to happen now ... it is a terrible situation, a real tragedy, we cannot believe what has happened."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Ms Douglas stopped briefly on the beach to throw her arms around a young woman holding a sigh that read: "I am Tunisian, I am not a terrorist, if you trust me, give me a hug."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The final moments of gunman Seifeddine Rezgui who opened fire on a beach packed with holidaymakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tourism represents around 13.8 per cent of the employment sector in Tunisia, which also makes up 15 per cent of the North African country's GDP, the majority coming from tourists travelling from France, the UK, Belgium and Germany and neighbouring Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The sector had already taken a serious hit following the attack in March on the National Bardo Museum in the capital Tunis, in which 22 people, again mostly foreign tourists, died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Islamic State has since claimed responsibilities for both terror attacks in Tunisia.Tunisia's tourism ministry announced on Monday that from July 1, 1000 armed officers would be deployed to reinforce tourism police, who would also carry guns for the first time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Armed officers would be deployed inside and outside hotels, on beaches and at tourist and archaeological sites, the ministry said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At least 38 people died in Rezgui's attack on the Imperial Marhaba and Bellevue beach hotels at Port El Kantaoui.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Eighteen people from the UK and Ireland have been confirmed among the dead, but officials have warned that toll could rise significantly in the coming days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The British Foreign Office upgraded its security advice for travel to Tunisia, saying: "Further terrorist attacks in Tunisia, including in tourist resorts, are possible, including by individuals who are unknown to the authorities and whose actions are inspired by terrorist groups via social media."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>It noted 424,707 British nationals visited Tunisia in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"Most British tourists stay in the coastal resorts and most visits are trouble free."</td></tr>
