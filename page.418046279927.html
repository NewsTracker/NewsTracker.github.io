<h3>First on CNN: Rubio slams Obamacare ruling</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Washington (CNN)Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio slammed the Supreme Court's decision on Thursday to uphold Obamacare subsidies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Supreme Court held that the law authorized federal tax credits for eligible Americans living not only in states with their own exchanges but in the 34 states with federal exchanges, a major win for the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I disagree with the court's ruling and believe they have once again erred in trying to correct the mistakes made by President Obama and Congress in forcing Obamacare on the American people," Rubio told CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Despite the court's decision, Obamacare is still a bad law that is having a negative impact on our country and on millions of Americans," Rubio continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I remain committed to repealing this bad law and replacing it with my consumer-centered plan that puts patients and families back in control of their health care decisions. We need Consumer Care, not Obamacare."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Thursday's 6-3 ruling is the second time in three years that the court has ruled to uphold Obamacare, Obama's signature domestic achievement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Supreme Court will soon rule on whether there's a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, a decision that could profoundly affect the lives of millions of Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some legal scholars see the court's gradual movement on gay rights issues as proof that the court is a force for change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But others say the court's role is largely the opposite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Another other major ruling upheld Obamacare subsidies; had it gone the other way, millions could have lost their health care tax credits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Some legal scholars say the court's historical mission has been to block change, not validate it, by defending the status quo and ruling in favor of "wealth, power and privilege."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They point to a 1918 ruling that struck down a federal law banning child labor, which left the practice in place for another two decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The court said the law was "repugnant to the Constitution" because it violated states' rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>At the time, millions of children worked in dangerous mines, dank sweatshops and textile mills such as this one in Vermont in 1910.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The court has been on the wrong side of history numerous times, says author Ian Millhiser of the Center for American Progress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It issued decisions that legitimized Jim Crow segregation, approved the forced sterilization of a woman against her will and forced Japanese-American citizens into internment camps during World War II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Other scholars such as Clark Neily of the libertarian public interest law firm Institute for Justice defend the court, saying Brown v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Board of Education -- which led to school desegregation, including in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957 -- shows that the court is often "better than the other branches of government and society in general."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Critics say the court makeup is part of the problem, noting that most justices have been white men from privileged backgrounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It's an issue, they argue, that can sometimes lead to paternalistic language, as in a 2006 abortion ruling that said "some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Many court critics have also questioned the wisdom of the 2010 Citizens United v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>FEC decision, which opened the floodgates for campaign financing, allowing outside groups to spend record amounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Millhiser said the ruling "gave billionaires a far-reaching right to corrupt American democracy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for himself, Justice Anthony Kennedy and the four liberal justices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the dissent, joined by Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In a dissent, Scalia said "we should start calling this law SCOTUScare," referring to the two times the Court has saved the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The ruling staved off a major political showdown and what would have been a mad scramble in some states to set up their own healthcare exchanges to keep millions from losing healthcare coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Challengers to the law argued that the federal government should not be allowed to continue doling out subsidies to individuals living in states without their own healthcare exchanges and a ruling in their favor would have cut off subsidies to 6.4 million Americans, absent a congressional fix or state action.</td></tr>
