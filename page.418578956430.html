<h3>Verdict reached against Colorado theater gunman James Holmes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A verdict has been reached in the deadly Colorado movie theater shooting trial of James Holmes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The verdict, yet to be announced, follows two days of debating among the jury on whether Holmes was legally insane when he opened fire inside of the packed Aurora theater three years ago next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Twelve people were killed and 70 others injured in the July 20, 2012 massacre during a midnight premier of Batman movie, "The Dark Knight Rises."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A court spokesman said the verdict will be announced at 4:15 p.m. local time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The now 27-year-old has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His defense has argued that he suffered schizophrenia and was not in control of himself when he put on a gas mask and stormed the theater while armed with an assault rifle, a shotgun and a pistol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If convicted, Holmes faces either life in prison without the possibility of parole or a death sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>If they find him not guilty by reason of insanity, he would be committed indefinitely to a state mental hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prosecutors focused on the findings of two state-appointed forensic psychiatrists who examined Holmes months and years after the shooting and found him severely mentally ill yet capable of knowing right from wrong and therefore legally sane under Colorado law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dozens of investigators testified about the carnage Holmes inflicted and how he rigged his apartment into an elaborate booby trap he hoped would explode and divert first responders from the movie theater during his rampage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Prosecutors honed in on Holmes' elaborate planning of the massacre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They showed jurors a spiral notebook in which Holmes listed what weapons to buy, which auditoriums in the theater complex would allow for the most casualties, and even an estimated emergency response time to the theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Defense attorneys portrayed Holmes as a struggling neuroscience graduate student so addled by mental illness that he was unable to tell right from wrong at the time of the shootings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They said he suffered schizophrenia, and they called two doctors who said Holmes was in the grips of a psychotic episode when he acted on delusions that propelled him to kill.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They called a far shorter list of witnesses, such as doctors and jail guards, who described Holmes' bizarre behavior before and after the attack.</td></tr>
