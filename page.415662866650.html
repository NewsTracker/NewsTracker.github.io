<h3>Duke beats San Diego State 68-49 to reach NCAA Sweet 16 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When he's playing like that, the Blue Devils have a shot to finish as the nation's best team right alongside him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Okafor scored 18 of his 26 points in a dominating first half and top-seeded Duke beat San Diego State 68-49 on Sunday in the NCAA Tournament, sending the freshmen-led Blue Devils back to the Sweet 16 to continue their push for coach Mike Krzyzewski's fifth national title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''It would mean the world to me,'' Okafor said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I've always wanted to win a national title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>... That's what (the freshmen) came to Duke to have an opportunity to win a national title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Duke - holding a No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>1 seed for the 11th time in 18 seasons but its first since 2011 - advanced to face fifth-seeded Utah in Houston's South Regional semifinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Blue Devils (31-4) reached the Sweet 16 for the 22nd time under Coach K, who said this group featuring four freshmen among its eight scholarship players is still improving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''They're together,'' Krzyzewski said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Fellow freshman Justise Winslow added 13 points and 12 rebounds for Duke, which shot 55 percent against the eighth-seeded Aztecs (27-9) two days after shooting 63 percent against 16th-seeded Robert Morris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Okafor scored 21 on 9-for-11 shooting against the seriously undersized Colonials, then made 12 of 16 shots against the Aztecs - who had size to wrestle with him but no way to stop him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>''Okafor is a load,'' Aztecs coach Steve Fisher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''He is hard to guard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>... But he's not the lone ranger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Winslow can play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>They have a terrific team and they can play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They played like a No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Winslow put on his own show with five assists, four steals and three blocks, one a jaw-dropper on JJ O'Brien at the rim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That set the ball loose in transition for Quinn Cook to bury a 3-pointer, then pretend to holster pistols as he turned to run back up the court - a sign that the Blue Devils were completely at ease and rolling with a confident strut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Aztecs were trying to reach the Sweet 16 for the third time under Fisher, but San Diego State - with a few players and coaches battling a stomach ailment - got off to a bad start and struggled to slow Duke early.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They made their best push to close a 37-24 halftime deficit to 44-37 on a 3-pointer from Malik Pope with 12:42 left, then got the ball back with a chance to inch closer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But Trey Kell missed an open shot in the lane, and Duke pushed to Cook for a 3 - a crushing five-point swing and the start of an 11-0 run that killed San Diego State's chance to get back in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>San Diego State: Winston Shepard scored a team-best 13 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>... San Diego State shot 33 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>... O'Brien scored eight points on 2-for-10 shooting.</td></tr>

<tr><td>35</td><td>The matchup was the first between Krzyzewski and Fisher in the NCAA Tournament since the 1992 title game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Krzyzewski's Blue Devils - featuring Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley and Grant Hill - won that one 71-51 against Fisher's Michigan team led by the ''Fab Five'' freshmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The nearly 23-year gap was the longest between tournament meetings for head coaches in NCAA history, according to STATS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>San Diego State: season over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Duke: will play Utah on Friday.</td></tr>
