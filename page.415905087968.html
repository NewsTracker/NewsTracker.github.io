<tr><td>2</td><td>Kathmandu - Thousands of doctors in Nepal stayed away from work at clinics and hospitals on Wednesday to support a colleague who has been on a hunger strike for 10 days demanding reforms in medical education and services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>More than 5 000 doctors took part in the action and only emergency services were open in hospitals across the Himalayan nation, said Dr Nirmal Rimal of the Nepal Medical Association.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The strike left most people in Nepal without access to doctors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The physicians are supporting Dr Govinda KC, who is demanding that the government make medical education affordable to more students and medical services available to all citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Only three of Nepal's 20 medical colleges are run by the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The private colleges charge huge fees and are unaffordable for the majority of the population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>KC is also alleging widespread corruption among officials in granting permits to private medical colleges and is demanding that the officials be dismissed and punished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The government formed a committee to negotiate with the doctors, but there was no agreement reached to end the strike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>KC had gone on a 15-day hunger strike last year for similar demands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He ended the hunger strike and doctors withdrew their protests after the government assured them there would be changes in the country's medical education system.</td></tr>
