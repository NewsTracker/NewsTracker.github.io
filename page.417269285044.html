<h3>Hundreds of Taxi Drivers March in Mexico Against Uber</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Hundreds of taxi drivers marched through Mexico City chanting "Uber Out!" and demanding city authorities ban the online ride service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Some drove their pink-and-white cabs in ranks, snarling traffic along the city's main boulevard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The drivers say that Uber and other ride-sharing services evade the tax, registration and safety laws that regular cabs are subject to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Taxi drivers' leader Eleazar Romero told the rally that "we are not against technology. We just want a level playing field, we want everyone to follow the same tax rules we do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Uber responded on its blog by offering Mexico City commuters free rides on Monday, with a hashtag that roughly translates as "If Mexico won't stop, Uber won't stop."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It said commuters could take up to two rides worth about $10 for free.</td></tr>
