<h3>Microsoft: The post-Windows company?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>That's an exaggeration, but Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) keeps finding new ways to prove that it is built to survive the "post-PC" world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sales of Windows tanked last quarter, falling 19% for business customers and a stunning 26% for consumers, over the same period last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That's mostly because Microsoft last year pulled life support from its decade-old Windows XP operating system, sending folks into a tizzy buying up Windows 7 and 8 licenses and PCs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With that big Windows-buying boom out of the way, Windows sales returned to normal -- that is, not all that great.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But Microsoft had plenty of fire power left in its arsenal to more than make up the difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Overall, Microsoft's profit fell by nearly 12% to $5 billion, in part due to the ongoing restructuring at the company -- Microsoft cut 18,000 jobs last year, forcing a $190 million hit to its bottom line this past quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Still, Microsoft earned 61 cents per share, well above Wall Street analysts' forecasts of 51 cents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Sales rose 6% to $21.7 billion, also exceeding analysts' expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Shares of Microsoft rose 3% after hours.</td></tr>
