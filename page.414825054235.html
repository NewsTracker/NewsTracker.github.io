<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>There are now more than 1,000 men, women and children housed at the centre, which is four times its current capacity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Some 2,700 migrants have been rescued from the Mediterranean since Saturday, the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Boats carrying more people are due to dock at Lampedusa later on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The influx has added more pressure to the already overflowing reception centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The centre's capacity has been reduced to 250 while refurbishment work is being carried out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It can normally accommodate 400 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The BBC's Tom Burridge says he has seen bus loads of men, women and children being transported around the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The charity Save the Children said the situation was tense with supplies of food and other essentials running low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Around 2,000 of the migrants were saved during a major operation off the Libyan coast over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Italian coastguard said its members were threatened by Kalashnikov-wielding men as they attempted to rescue people from dinghies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Most of the 1,200 people we spoke to at Lampedusa's overcrowded reception centre were men in their early 20s and teens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Abdi Najid from Somalia said he travelled across five countries to reach Libya, where he paid smugglers several thousand dollars for the right to travel on their one of their boats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 15-year-old now wants to live in Norway.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>Many more people went missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He now wants to get to Switzerland and find a job.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lampedusa's proximity to North Africa has made it a regular target for tens of thousands of migrants attempting to reach Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>About 3,500 died in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Earlier this month, at least 300 people drowned when the dinghies they were travelling in got into trouble.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>Italy's major patrol and rescue operation Mare Nostrum ended last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A smaller scale EU operation, Triton, took over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Last week, the UNHCR said better lifesaving provisions were urgently needed to avoid further tragedies.</td></tr>
