<tr><td>2</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - With Israeli elections looming and the region in turmoil, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu found himself once more enmeshed in a gossipy scandal on Tuesday: a new government report alleged possible financial malfeasance at his official residence, while his wife faced criticism for pettiness and possible security breaches after complaining about their kitchen in a video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The uproar jolted an election campaign in which Netanyahu's opponents have tried to portray him as enjoying a lavish lifestyle and being out of touch with the struggles of average Israelis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Netanyahu's allies angrily dismissed the allegations as part of a campaign to deflect attention from important national security issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In its report released Tuesday, the state comptroller, an official watchdog, cited large sums of public money spent on food, furniture, cleaning and gardening at the couple's official residence in Jerusalem and their private home in the exclusive coastal city of Caesarea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cleaning expenses in that home alone averaged more than $2,100 a month in taxpayer's money, according to the report, even though the couple only spent the occasional weekend there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It also said they pocketed proceeds from recycling bottles that had been purchased for entertaining official guests.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>In a statement, Netanyahu said he respected the findings of the comptroller and pledged to implement recommendations to curb wasteful spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>At the same time he lashed out at the "ongoing media campaign" that he said is aimed at toppling him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"There is absolutely no indication of any assault on the public's integrity and certainly no indication of any criminal transgressions," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A former member of their housekeeping staff has filed a lawsuit claiming he was mistreated and verbally abused by Sara Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In one instance, Meni Naftali alleged she called him at 3 a.m. to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In another, he claimed that she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old.</td></tr>
