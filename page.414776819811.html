<h3>Ukraine cease-fire largely holding, Debaltseve still tense</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ukrainian military convoy stop on the road between the towns of Dabeltseve and Artemivsk, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. 14, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The fighting between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces has continued despite the agreement reached by leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France in the Belarusian capital of Minsk on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Much of the fighting had taken place near Debaltseve, a key transport hub that has been hotly contested in recent days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The leaders agreed to implement a cease-fire, set to take effect on Sunday, at one minute after midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>LUHANSKE, Ukraine (AP) - A cease-fire that went into effect Sunday in eastern Ukraine appeared largely to be holding, although continued fighting over a bitterly contested railway hub is threatening to upend the delicate settlement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, who last week brokered a deal to try to end the conflict that has raged since April, agreed in a conference call Sunday that hostilities should also cease around the government-held town of Debaltseve, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's office said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Undeterred, armed separatists appeared intent to pursue their claim to the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Heavy fog shrouding sodden fields muffled the sound of artillery, but regular shelling could still be heard from Luhanske, a town about 15 kilometers (9 miles) to northwest of Debaltseve and over 80 kilometers west of the city Luhansk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Associated Press journalists were blocked from moving closer by Ukrainian troops, who said it was not safe to travel ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The cease-fire has kindled slender hopes of a reprieve from a conflict that has claimed more than 5,300 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Withdrawal of heavy armor from the front line by both sides is scheduled to begin Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Attention will be focused in the coming days on Debaltseve, where Ukrainian forces have been fending off severe onslaughts from the rebels for weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The town is a railway link between the main separatist-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The diminution in hostilities was agreed after a marathon session of diplomacy that brought together Poroshenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French leader Francois Hollande for talks in the capital of Belarus, Minsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In a conference call Sunday, the leaders agreed the cease-fire should extend to Debaltseve, according to a statement from Poroshenko's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That flies in the face of the position taken by rebels, who argue they should be granted immediate control over the town as it is entirely surrounded by their forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Separatist officials have said any force adopted against Ukrainian troops in Debaltseve would accordingly not violate the Minsk agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As he issued the cease-fire order at one minute after midnight Kiev time Sunday (2201 GMT, 5:01 p.m. EST), Poroshenko had said the road to the town remained open and that Ukrainian troops there had been resupplied with ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Merkel's office said that the call's participants welcomed the general acceptance of the truce, but were concerned about continuing combat operations, especially in the area around Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"They showed determination to work toward a full implementation of the true. As a next step, Tuesday's agreed on withdrawal of heavy arms had to be started," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The offices of both Merkel and Hollande said the leaders involved in Sunday's call also expressed joint support for adopting a United Nations Security Council resolution codifying the measures adopted in Minsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A statement from the Kremlin confirmed they discussed the difficult situation in Debaltseve and also the role of the OSCE in monitoring the cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Under the deal hammered out at last week's negotiations, the progress of the cease-fire is to be monitored by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The head of the OSCE monitoring mission, Ertugrul Apakan, said that the organization has dispatched 20 patrols to monitor the state of the cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We made an attempt to send our monitors to Debaltseve, however our patrol has been refused access by the so-called DPR," Apakan said, using the acronym for the Donetsk People's Republic separatist movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Apakan said the cease-fire was being respected on the whole barring some isolated instances.</td></tr>
