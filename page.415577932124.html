<h3>Man who threatened Ferguson officer must stay off Facebook</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SEATTLE (AP) - A judge says a Washington state man who posted threatening comments on Facebook against a former Ferguson, Missouri, police officer can avoid prison but must stay off from social media sites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik on Thursday told Jaleel Abdul-Jabbaar that he'll be on supervised release for three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Lasnik says the two months Abdul-Jabbaar already spent in jail were an adequate term behind bars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Abdul-Jabbaar's case is part of a broader legal debate over the point at which social media rants go beyond hyperbole and become criminal acts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The judge says the case was difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But he says he accepted the argument that Abdul-Jabbaar's comments were simply a strong reaction to events in Ferguson, and he didn't intend to follow through on a threat to shoot Darren Wilson.</td></tr>
