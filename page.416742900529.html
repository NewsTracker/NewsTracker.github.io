<h3>Google tractor-beams Star Wars universe into Knowledge Graph</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Star Wars fans no longer have to search their feelings to discover the truth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They can just Google it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The search engine and the Lucasfilm movie franchise said Monday they have put information from the Star Wars universe into Google's Knowledge Graph, the first time for a fictional universe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Knowledge Graph answers direct questions, either typed on a computer or spoken into a mobile device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After typing, "Who is Luke's father?" for example, Google now presents the answer, Darth Vader, in a box that offers a short summary with clickable links for more information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The tie-up was announced on what is known to fans as Star Wars Day - May 4, as in May the Fourth Be With You - and is part of the build up to "Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens," to be released in December.</td></tr>
