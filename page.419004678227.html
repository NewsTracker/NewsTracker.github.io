<h3>Donald Trump staffer fired over past racially charged Facebook posts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A political adviser to Donald Trump has been fired from the real-estate mogul's presidential campaign over racially charged posts on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Trump campaign confirmed to the Guardian on Sunday that longtime aide Sam Nunberg had been fired, after Business Insider reported on an eight-year-old social media post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In 2007, a post on Nunberg's Facebook page referring to the veteran civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton read: "Meeting Rev Sharpton today, no joke - he will tell him that his daughter is N---!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The profile contained a number of other charged posts, which included references to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as "Huckahuck" and to Barack Obama as a "Socialist Marxist Islamo Fascist Nazi Appeaser".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In an interview with CNN on Friday, Nunberg did not acknowledge writing the posts, which were still viewable on his Facebook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Anything that was posted under my name does not mean I posted it," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He added: "I am not adept at social media."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nunberg took pains to emphasize that postings from more than a half-decade ago predated his association with the current Republican frontrunner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I have a long record of working with diverse people," he told CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"And anything you are reporting on does not reflect anything on Mr Trump or Mr Trump's campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I would also point out that all of these things were done before Mr Trump's campaign, if I even did them - which I deny. In any event, this is the problem with politics | politics as usual is wrong."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nunberg, an associate of veteran operative and Trump adviser Roger Stone, was fired and rehired by Trump in 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His sin then was arranging for BuzzFeed's McKay Coppins to write a profile that Trump disliked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The controversial Facebook posts, the most recent of which is from 2009, also represent the second time a Trump staffer has come under scrutiny in the past week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The first was when Michael Cohen, a special counsel for the Trump organization who has frequently appeared on television as a surrogate for the candidate, repeatedly threatened a reporter and insisted spousal rape was legal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Trump has stood by Cohen, who issued a series of vulgar threats to Tim Mak, a reporter for the Daily Beast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Trump, who himself has faced increased scrutiny from Democrats in recent days, has led in every national poll of the Republican field since early July.</td></tr>
