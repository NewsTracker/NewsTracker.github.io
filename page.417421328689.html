<h3>Unbelievable: Ex-FIFA VP uses The Onion as his defense</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Former FIFA vice president Jack Warner has renewed his criticism of the United States, where he faces corruption charges, based on a story by satirical website The Onion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In an eight-minute Facebook video, Warner holds up a printout with The Onion headline: "FIFA Frantically Announces 2015 Summer World Cup In United States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Warner asked "if FIFA is so bad why is it the U.S. wants & the World Cup?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Warner points out that FIFA is "the very same organization they [the U.S.] are accusing of being corrupt. That has to be double standards."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The fake story was published on Wednesday, hours after Warner was indicted in the U.S. and arrested in Trinidad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Warner asks why the story was "two days before the FIFA election" when Sepp Blatter was re-elected as president.</td></tr>
