<h3>'Democratic Socialist' Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders will run for president, joining Hillary Clinton and running far to her political left</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Right-wing political agitators have long griped that President Barack Obama is a socialist in disguise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now a U.S. senator who wears the label proudly is preparing a run to replace him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 73, will run for president as a Democrat, according to multiple press reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The independent who describes himself as a 'democratic socialist' and routinely praises Scandinavian-style social democracy will announce Thursday that he plans to seek the Democratic Party's nomination in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>If he were to run and win, he would become the oldest president in U.S. history on his Inauguration Day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sanders, shown this month addressing Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two people familiar with Sanders' plans spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Spokesmenfor Sanders did not directly respond to requests for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Vermont Public Radio reported that Sanders will release a short statement on Thursday, waiting a few weeks to hold a campaign kickoff event in his home state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sanders will become the second major Democrat in the race, joining former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the run-up to his announcement, Sanders has urged Clinton to speak out strongly about issues related to income inequality and climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clinton is viewed as a heavy favorite in the Democratic primary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But she has been beset with political headaches over claims that she and former president Bill Clinton enriched themselves and their family foundation by peddling her influence as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>WIth Sanders in the race, Clinton will find herself with an added source of pressure as a steady voice from her political left will criticize any move toward the center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Bernie Sanders, 73, is the longest serving independent in U.S. Congressional history, serving since 1991.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Born into a family of Polish Jewish immigrants in New York in 1941, he was involved in student activism before entering politics with the anti-Vietnam War Liberty Union Party in Vermont.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In 1981, at the suggestion of his friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religion at the University of Vermont, Sanders ran for mayor of Burlington and defeated six-term Democratic incumbent Gordon Paquette by 14 votes in a four-way contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Sanders won three more terms, defeating both Democratic and Republican candidates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In his final run for mayor in 1987, Sanders defeated a candidate endorsed by both major parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He temporarily retired from politics in 1989, teaching political science at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government while making an unsuccessful run for Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He was elected on his second attempt, defeating Republican incumbent Lieutenant Governor Peter Smith to become the first congressional independent in 40 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Sanders co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991 and was its first chairman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He caucuses with the Democratic Party and is counted as a Democrat for purposes of committee assignments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Republicans attacked Sanders as 'an ineffective extremist' for successfully sponsoring only one law and 15 amendments in his eight terms in the House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But in 2006 he was elected to the U.S. Senate in the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He was re-elected in 2012 with 71 per cent of the vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>VPR interviewed Sanders on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The senator spelled out his opposition to expanded trade-promotion authority that would allow the White House more negotiating flexibility in trade deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>President Barack Obama wants that 'fast-track' authority, and congressional Republicans seem eager to give him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Such a deal would give the White House greater negotiating latitute, requiring it only to bring a finished trade package before Congress for an up-or-down vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Sanders and other progressives have slammed the idea as a back-door way for corporate interests to side-step environmental and economic-justice demands of the political left, and avoid public scrutiny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>'If you want to understand why the middle class in America is disappearing and why we have more wealth and income inequality in America than we have had since the late 1920s, you have to address the issue of trade,' Sanders told VPR.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'All of the major corporations want to continue with this trade policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Wall Street wants to continue this trade policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The drug companies want to continue this trade policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But organizations representing American workers and the environment do not want to continue the trade policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Vermont senator directly challenged Clinton on the issue, suggesting he's not shy about confronting the Democratic front-runner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>'I think that Hillary Clinton and every candidate out there should in fact address whether or not they support this T.P.P.,' he told VPR.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Sanders has quietly visited early presidential priomary and caucus states, gauging interest in a candidacy that would have room to run in a mostly empty Democratic field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He delivered a speech to the South Carolina Democratic Party last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>News reports indicate enthusiasm for his economic message, which focused on income inequality themes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>In many ways Sanders has indicated his belief that President Obama hasn't veered far enough to the left since taking office in 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He told NBC's 'Meet the Press' program in September that he has 'a lot of disagreements' with the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>'I think he has not tapped the anger and thefrustration that the American people feel on many, many issues,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Sanders also predicted that 'anybody who speaks to the needs of the working class and the middle class of this country and shows the courage to take on the billionaire class ... will do pretty well' in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>More than two dozen people from America's two major political parties are considered potential presidential candidates in the 2016 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Just four have formally entered the race; most are biding their time and assessing their chances.</td></tr>

<tr><td>55</td><td>Jeanette is a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader who posed for the squad's first swimsuit calendar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Claim to fame: Rubio's personal story as the son of Cuban emigres is a powerful narrative, and helped him win his Senate seat in 2010 against a well-funded governor whom he initially trailed by 20 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Achilles heel: Rubio was part of a bipartisan 'gang of eight' senators who crafted an Obama-approved immigration reform bill in 2013 which never became law - a move that angered conservative Republicans.</td></tr>

<tr><td>68</td><td>Claim to fame: Clinton was the first US first lady with a postgraduate degree and presaged Obamacare with a failed attempt at health care reform in the 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>Achilles heel: A long series of financial and ethical scandals has dogged Clinton, including recent allegations that her husband and their family foundation benefited financially from decisions she made as secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Bolton is a foreign policy wonk with plenty of international experience, but his positions on economic and social issues are less well-known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>He has taken few steps toward an actual candidacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Bush has a father and a brother who occupied the Oval Office, and the capacity to raise massive amounts of campaign cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>He has alienated conservatives, though, by embracing immigration reform and 'Common Core' education standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Carson's hard-edged conservatism has confounded civil rights leaders who seldom see African-American right-wingers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>He draws large crowds, however, and has shown an ability to raise money quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Pugnacious and unapologetic, Christie would bring an ego-driven brashness to the race - although his abrasive style and echos of his 'Bridgegate' scandal might ultimately sink him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>If it takes a woman to beat a woman, Fiorina could be the GOP's answer to Hillary Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>She has been by far the most aggressive Republican on the campaign trail in directly targeting the former secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>Graham was a non-factor until a March summit in Iowa where he stole the show and put himself on the map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>'Huck' is a former Baptist minister who left his weekend Fox News show to clear the way for a second White House run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>He won the Iowa Caucuses and placed third in New Hampshire in 2008 but only collected about one-quarter of the delegates needed to win the nom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Jindal's main claim to fame is his strident opposition to federal-level 'Common Core' education standards, which included a federal lawsuit that a judge dismissed in late March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>Kasich is a popular governor in the battleground Buckeye State, but has little name-recognition elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>He has accommodated liberals on some issues and could be seen as a more palatable version of Jeb Bush for Republicans who are anxious about electing a family dynasty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Pence's name was on plenty of Republican strategists' lips until his signed a state law this year that allowed businesses to discriminate against homosexuals under the cover of religious freedom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Now he's a long shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Perry was a top-tier candidate in 2012 until his 'Oops!' moment in a debate, when he couldn't remember one of his own policy positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>He now also faces a criminal indictment in Texas over tenuous claims that he abused his power.</td></tr>

<tr><td>95</td><td>He has loudly criticized President Obama and claims he can negotiate with foreign governments better than anyone else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>Biden would be a natural candidate as the White House's sitting second-banana, but his reputation as a one-man gaffe factory will keep Democrats from taking him seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Brown has been a presidential candidate three times and earned the nickname 'Moonbeam' for his liberal policy ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Today he's seen as a centrist but is likely leaning against another run.</td></tr>
