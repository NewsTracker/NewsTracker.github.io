<h3>Chelsea frustrated as Saints make a point</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jose Mourinho's side were desperate to bounce back from their midweek Champions League exit against Paris Saint Germain and take advantage of Manchester City's surprise defeat against Burnley on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But Dusan Tadic's 19th penalty cancelled out Costa's 11th minute opener and denied the Blues the chance to establish an even more commanding lead over the chasing pack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While a point extended Chelsea's lead at the head of the table to six points, having played a game less than second-placed City, it was a disappointing end to a frustrating week for Mourinho and company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The draw also frustrated Southampton who were unable to make bigger inroads in their efforts to force their way back into contention for a top four finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mourinho had responded to the Champions League exit by rounding on his team's critics Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness, the former Liverpool players turned TV pundits, came in for particular attention for their comments about the Chelsea players behaviour towards the referee - and bullishly insisting his team would make up for that set-back by winning the title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Chelsea manager's decision to retain 10 of the starting line-up that failed to beat PSG, Willian came in for Ramires, reinforced the view that Mourinho had faith in his players' resilience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And the opening moments of the game suggested the Portuguese's confidence was not misplaced with his side capping a bright start with a much-needed goal from Costa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The move that led to Chelsea taking the lead offered a reminder of the qualities they have shown for much of the season with Eden Hazard exchanging passes with Costa outside the Southampton area before working the ball out to Branislav Ivanovic on the right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Costa, meanwhile, spotted a gap in the visitors' defences and darted into the area where he met Ivanovic's well-flighted cross with a powerful header from just six yards out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The pain of Wednesday evening had been eased, but Southampton responded immediately, confirming they had no intention of simply playing a supporting role as Mourinho's team repaired their wounded morale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Ronald Koeman's side had enjoyed a 12-day break since the victory over Crystal Palace that had revived their top-four challenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Presented with the opportunity to take his players for a mid-season break, Koeman broke with tradition, opting to head for the snow of Switzerland instead of the more traditional warm weather training trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The move appeared to have had the desired effect with Southampton looking sharp and refreshed as they quickly recovered and were back on level terms thanks to a contentious penalty decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Referee Mike Dean decided the excellent Sadio Mane was brought down after the Southampton forward found himself sandwiched between Nemanja Matic and Ivanovic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Chelsea players were clearly unhappy at the decision but, having being accused of surrounding referee Bjorn Kuipers and contributing to the Dutchman's decision to dismiss Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Wednesday, the reaction this time was muted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There was another potential flashpoint shortly afterwards when Ivanovic's appeals for a penalty were dismissed, but the home side's main concern was how to stifle Koeman's side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama were dominating the midfield while Tadic and Mane repeatedly threatened Thibaut Courtois' goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>By contrast, Chelsea appeared ponderous and were fortunate to reach half-time on level terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The second half brought an improvement from Mourinho's side with Costa becoming more prominent, particularly when the forward diverted Willian's shot against the upright.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The momentum of the game continued to favour Chelsea and it took two excellent saves from Saints keeper Fraser Forster to keep out a Hazard header and an Oscar shot before John Terry blazed wide in a frantic finale.</td></tr>

<h3>Russia was ready for a 'nuclear state of alert' over Crimea: Putin</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Moscow: Russia was ready to bring its nuclear weapons into a state of alert during last year's tensions over the Crimean Peninsula, President Vladimir Putin says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Putin has also expanded on a previous admission that the well-armed forces in unmarked uniforms who took control of Ukrainian military facilities in Crimea were Russian soldiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>His comments, in a documentary being shown on state TV, highlight the extent to which alarm spread in Russia in the weeks following Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's ousting in February 2014 after months of street protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After Yanukovych fled Kiev, eventually surfacing in Russia, separatist sentiment soared in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula dominated by ethnic Russians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Russian forces took control of Ukrainian military facilities on the peninsula and a referendum on secession was hastily called.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The referendum, which was widely denounced in the West as illegitimate, reportedly brought overwhelming support for secession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russia annexed Crimea on March 19, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the documentary, which marks a year since the referendum, Mr Putin says of the nuclear preparedness: "We were ready to do this ... (Crimea) is our historical territory. Russian people live there. They were in danger. We cannot abandon them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The comments were reported on the state broadcaster's website after its transmission in the Russian Far East and before it appeared on the air in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Putin said his plans for a Crimean operation started after Mr Yanukovych fled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We never thought about severing Crimea from Ukraine until the moment that these events began, the government overthrow," he said, repeating Russia's contention that Mr Yanukovych was the victim of a coup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The documentary comes as speculation swirls about Mr Putin's 10-day absence from public view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>On Monday, he will meet with the president of Kyrgyzstan in an event covered by the news media, which would be his first appearance before journalists since March 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He postponed a meeting with Kazakh and Belarussian leaders last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Putin's silence in the past week has fuelled feverish speculation on everything from the state of his health to his grip on power and whether he went to Switzerland to watch his girlfriend give birth.</td></tr>
