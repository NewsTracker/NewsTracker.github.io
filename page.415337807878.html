<h3>Newly released video shows Suge Knight running over two men</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A videotape posted on celebrity news website TMZ on Monday shows Marion "Suge" Knight running over two men with his pick-up truck at a Los Angeles area burger stand, killing one of them, in an incident that led to hit-and-run charges against the rap mogul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The graphic video appears to support prosecutors' contention that Knight deliberately struck Cle "Bone" Sloan and Terry Carter with his red Ford F-150 on Jan. 29 following an altercation in the driveway of Tam's Burgers in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sloan, 51, survived his injuries but Carter, 55, was pronounced dead at a local hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Matthew Fletcher, who formally took over as Knight's attorney during a hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday, told reporters that the video would help exonerate his client because it showed him fleeing an ambush at the fast-food restaurant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fletcher said the video also shows a third man removing a gun from Sloan as he lay on the ground injured, helping prove the defense argument that Knight, 49, had been lured to Tam's burgers for an attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The videotape, which appears to have been shot by a security camera at the fast-food stand, begins with Knight pulling quickly into the driveway, where he is immediately confronted by Sloan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The two men trade blows through the driver's window of the truck for about 20 seconds before Knight reverses the vehicle, knocking Sloan to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A few seconds later the truck reappears, accelerating through the driveway and running over both Sloan and Carter as two other men scamper out of the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One of those men then removes a black object that Fletcher says is a handgun from the injured Sloan and slips it into his waistband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Knight has pleaded innocent to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges stemming from the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The co-founder of influential Death Row Records has previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and could face 25 years to life in prison under California's so-called three-strikes law if he is convicted at trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Knight, who was shot six times in a nightclub altercation last year, has been taken to a jail infirmary complaining of ill health following several hearings in the case.</td></tr>
