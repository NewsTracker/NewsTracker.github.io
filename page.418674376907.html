<h3>Greek banks reopen but cash limits remain and taxes soar</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>People pass a pedestrian crossing at Syntagma square in Athens, Monday, July 20, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece set a series of landmarks Monday it hopes will shore up its battered economy following months of crisis that threatened its place in the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Banks reopened after more than three weeks, and the cash-strapped country got enough money from European creditors to pay around 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) it owed to the International Monetary Fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>For most recession-weary Greeks, Monday was all about the price of goods in the shops as new tax rises demanded by creditors on everything from coffee to taxis took effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And though the banks may have opened, strict limits on cash withdrawals remained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For an economy reeling from the recent uncertainty over the country's euro future, the continuing controls on capital and the tax rises aren't going down too well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dimitris Chronis, who has been running a small kebab shop in central Athens for 20 years, says the new taxes could push his business over the edge especially when combined with higher business taxes and meat prices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I can't put up my prices because I'll have no customers at all," said Chronis, who said sales have slid by around 80 percent since banking restrictions were imposed June 29.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We used to deliver to offices nearby but most of them have closed. People would order a lot and buy food for their colleagues on special occasions. That era is over."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There are few parts of the Greek economy left untouched by the increase in sales taxes on many basic goods from 13 percent to 23 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>They have been imposed on many basic goods, from cooking oils to condoms, through to popular services, such as eating out at restaurants and ferries to the Greek islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The tax rises formed part of a package of confidence-building measures the Greek government had to introduce for negotiations on a third bailout to begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In response to the latest austerity measures being passed by the Greek Parliament, the European Central Bank raised the amount of liquidity assistance on offer to Greek banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The European Union also sent a three-month loan to Athens to pay a 4.2 billion-euro debt due to the ECB Monday and clear its arrears with the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I can confirm that Greece today repaid the totality of its arrears," IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Greece is therefore no longer in arrears to the IMF."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Rice said the IMF "stands ready to continue assisting Greece in its efforts to return to financial stability and growth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The IMF is not directly involved in Greece's request for a third bailout as its previous rescue runs until early next year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But it has expressed doubts on the measures that Greece's European creditors are demanding without significant debt relief for Athens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The higher taxes formed a key plank of last week's bailout agreement between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and European creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Following months of growing distrust, Greece's partners in the 19-country eurozone wanted to see measures enacted before bailout talks could begin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Other austerity measures included cuts to pensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The green light to the opening of discussions, which are expected to last around a month, was given Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They will include economic targets and reforms deemed necessary in return for an anticipated 85 billion euros ($93 billion) over three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Though the potential bailout has eased fears of a potential Greek exit from the euro, capital controls of some sort are expected to remain in place for months if not years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The controls were introduced because negotiations with creditors had reached an impasse, fueling fears of a Greek exit from the euro and a bank run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>On Monday, the first easing saw banks reopen their doors for limited services.</td></tr>
