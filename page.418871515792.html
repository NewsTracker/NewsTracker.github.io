<h3>Google unlinks Google+ from YouTube</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google has revealed plans to sideline its social network Google+ by changing the way users log in to its products and services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It said it would no longer require users to sign up to Google+ to post comments to products such as YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Brad Horowitz, who manages Google's photos and sharing services, announced the changes in a blog on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One expert told the BBC that some YouTube creators had reacted to the news with "glee".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google had been criticised by YouTube stars over its attempt to integrate Google+ with the video sharing site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Many argued Google had attempted to integrate Google+ with the more successful YouTube platform to give the struggling social network a boost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The initial uproar was just insane. There were songs made about Google+ and how much people disliked it," said Alex Brinnand, managing editor YouTube magazine TenEighty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"There was an overriding feeling that we were already swamped with other social media platforms, and people felt that they were forced into the deal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Horowitz confirmed that Google+ integration with other websites would slowly be rolled back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"In the coming months, a Google Account will be all you'll need to share content, communicate with contacts, create a YouTube channel and more, all across Google," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He later made additional comments on his own Google+ page, in which he admitted that requiring people to register on Google+ to post comments on YouTube since November 2013 had been a "controversial" decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We want to formally retire the notion that a Google+ membership is required for anything at | other than using Google+ itself," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>YouTube clarified that people who were happy with the integration would not have to take any action, but an option to unlink a YouTube account from Google+ would be introduced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Reaction to the news had been greeted with "glee" by some YouTube video bloggers, said Mr Brinnand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"For many creators this feel like it's been a long time coming. People have been rooting for this to happen," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"People felt like they were forced into joining Google+ and be active on it, and that's not something they accepted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"When Google made the announcement on Monday, I could feel a collective sigh of relief. It's almost as though Google has given up the fight, it has let go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"But at least it shows Google is listening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"There's sometimes a presumption that YouTube doesn't listen to creators, but now it really had.</td></tr>
