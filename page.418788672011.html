<h3>Kazmir pitches well in Astros debut, beating Royals 4-0 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Scott Kazmir made a strong first impression on his new teammates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kazmir pitched seven strong innings in his Houston debut, leading the Astros to a 4-0 win over the Kanas City Royals on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The 31-year-old left-hander limited the Royals to three singles and only runner - Mike Moustakas in the fourth - past first base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kazmir (6-5), who lowered his ERA to 2.24, retired the final nine batters he faced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''It's nice to get the first one out of the way,'' Kazmir said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''When you have a defense like I had behind me especially what you see the first couple of innings, you have a lot of confidence out there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kazmir, acquired by the Astros from Oakland on Thursday for two minor leaguers, hasn't lost a July start since July 10, 2010, going 7-0 in his past 14 starts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kazmir met his catcher Jason Castro for the first time just before batting practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''He's going to be huge for us,'' Castro said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''Obviously, the reason we went out and got him is exactly what he did tonight, to give us solid innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>We can't expect him to throw a shutout every time, but that would be nice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Preston Tucker had three of the Astros' hits, including his fourth home run in five games - a solo shot in the third inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Colby Rasmus singled home Carlos Correa later in the inning to make it 2-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''I hadn't got a chance to see him pitch this year,'' Tucker said of Kazmir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''I knew he was good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>I didn't know what to expect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>That was awesome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Correa, a 20-year-old rookie who extended his hitting streak to nine games, and Jose Altuve each singled home a run in the fourth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Left-hander Tony Sipp walked Moustakas and gave up a single to Eric Hosmer in the ninth, which prompted manager A.J. Hinch to summon closer Luke Gregerson for the final two outs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Gregerson logged his 21st save in 24 opportunities, getting Kendrys Morales to ground into a game inning double play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Royals right-hander Jeremy Guthrie (7-6) gave up four runs and 11 hits, matching his season high, and two walks in seven innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>It was the eighth time this season and his third straight start Guthrie has allowed at least eight hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It was too much Kazmir for the Royals to overcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''He really handled us with fastballs and changeups,'' Royals manager Ned Yost said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''But changing speeds ... his fastball was 93-95.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>His changeup was 74 to 80.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A lot of variation there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Really commanded the ball well, kept the ball down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The Astros won their fifth straight and are 6-1 since the All-Star break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Royals are 0-4 against the Astros this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Astros: INF Jed Lowrie (ligament right thumb tear) has begun a rehab assignment with Double-A Corpus Christi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Royals: LF Alex Gordon (left groin strain) has started a throwing program, but manager Ned Yost said Gordon is a ways off before returning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Astros: RHP Scott Feldman will be making his second start since May 26 and going on the disabled list after knee surgery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Royals: LHP Danny Duffy lost to the Astros on June 30, allowing four runs on six hits over 6 2/3 innings.</td></tr>
