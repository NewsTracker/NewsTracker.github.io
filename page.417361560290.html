<h3>Will Baltimore?s troubles handicap O?Malley?s White House hopes?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Martin O'Malley, speaking at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Did the flames and fury that ravaged West Baltimore last month reflect the fate of former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's likely presidential campaign?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>O'Malley fashions himself as a no-nonsense crime fighter, but his city has not only become a national monument to urban devastation, but it is experiencing one of its worst murder sprees in years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The former Baltimore mayor and Maryland governor is expected to announce Saturday that he's seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When he addresses a rally that morning in Baltimore's Federal Hill Park, in the city's gleaming Inner Harbor, he'll offer a record that's part gutsy liberal, championing gay marriage and higher minimum wages, and part tough-on-crime urban healer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Other Democrats in the presidential race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, don't have that background.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But they also don't have to answer the kinds of hard questions O'Malley faces, particularly among African-Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He made his reputation as the mayor who successfully reduced crime in one of the nation's most violent cities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A centerpiece of his strategy was a "zero tolerance" policy toward any violation of the law, no matter how minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It chilled further the already tense relationship between police and crime-ravaged communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It was a miserable failure," said the Rev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Alvin Gwynn Sr., president of the city's Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It was so lopsided; it affected minorities more than anyone else."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Justice Policy Institute, a nonprofit research group, found that those policies resulted in an unusually high number of arrests, "many for minor and sometimes frivolous offenses, like loitering and open container violations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>An opponent could have an easy time ripping into O'Malley on this issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"This is a ready-made TV ad," said Craig Varoga, chief strategist for O'Malley's 2010 gubernatorial campaign, now a Democratic consultant not aligned with a presidential candidate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>O'Malley has vigorously defended his urban policies, saying they were effective in reducing crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Under his leadership, he told the Polk County, Iowa, Democratic Party on April 10, "Baltimore went on to achieve the greatest reduction of crime of any city in America."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>O'Malley points to his expanding efforts to deal with police brutality and has noted that all over Baltimore, people were clamoring for a crackdown on crime when he took office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>His supporters refer to a 2010 Baltimore Sun column that noted, "People all over the city were sold on zero tolerance. You can knock it now, but that's how a lot of us felt 10 years ago, as Baltimore came hobbling and bloodied out of the 1990s."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Sun found that Baltimore's 2000-2010 decline in "incidents of crime" was the biggest drop of any major city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>O'Malley's claims appear correct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Times have since changed dramatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Two days after O'Malley's Iowa speech, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American, was injured while being arrested in West Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He died a week later from damage to his spinal cord, and community outrage over the police handling of the matter sparked violent protests in late April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Fires raged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Stores were looted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Police and protesters filled the streets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>At the same time, crime in the city has been on the upswing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>So far in May, the city has recorded 36 homicides, its deadliest month since December 1999, when O'Malley was sworn in as mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Some see the turmoil giving O'Malley the same kind of boost he had when he ran for mayor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>At the height of his zero tolerance effort, he won re-election as mayor overwhelmingly in 2003, and he went on in 2006 to win the governorship over incumbent Republican Gov. Robert Ehrlich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"He has an opportunity to turn it to his advantage," said Doug Thornell, managing director at SKDKnickerbocker, a political consulting firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"He can lead a discussion on how to improve opportunities in urban America."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>While O'Malley's rally Saturday will be a psychological world away from the riot-torn Baltimore streets, "The riots there are going to be an inevitable part of the coverage of his announcement. It's probably not a good look for him," said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, a website for election analysis at the University of Virginia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>O'Malley hasn't avoided the controversy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He cut short a trip to Ireland as civil unrest gripped West Baltimore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>He came home and visited neighborhood churches, helped prepare food bags and chatted with local residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He defended his record, noting that as mayor he never had any community leader ask for fewer police in the neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>And he wrote an op-ed for The Huffington Post, urging several steps to ease urban ills: expanded drug treatment, body cameras for law enforcement officers and "timely and standard reporting of police-involved shootings, excessive force and discourtesy complaints so that we can improve public trust for public safety."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>O'Malley starts his campaign already in a deep hole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Despite frequent trips to key early primary and caucus states, he's barely noticed among Democratic voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Iowa's Loras College Poll last month had him fourth at 2.4 percent, well behind Clinton, at 57 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>In the University of New Hampshire Survey Center poll of Democrats from April 24 to May 3, O'Malley was tied for sixth with 1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>He was seen favorably by 10 percent of Democratic voters - but 58 percent didn't know him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"Ultimately, all of the non-Clinton Democrats need a surprising development to truly compete for the nomination - something we can't predict right now, " said Kondik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Will Baltimore's troubles handicap O'Malley's White House hopes?</td></tr>
