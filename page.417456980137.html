<h3>US-led coalition against IS extremists re-examines strategy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PARIS (AP) " Iraq's prime minister and international allies are gathering in Paris to re-examine their strategy against Islamic State extremists, after the group's recent gains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The coalition, which includes the United States and France but not Russia, Iran or Syria, is meeting Tuesday after extremists conquered both the Iraqi city of Ramadi and the historic Syrian city of Palmyra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>More than 4,100 airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition have failed to stem gains by Islamic State radicals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said airstrikes can only be effective if all Iraqis believe "the government is inclusive."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Obama administration is similarly impatient with what many critics see as the Shiite-led government's corruption and sectarianism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, no sharp change in strategy is expected to be announced at Tuesday's meeting.</td></tr>
