<h3>Robert Durst had latex mask, a fake Texas ID and $42,000 when arrested</h3>

<tr><td>38</td><td>'I don't know what they're looking for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>I don't know what they could be looking for 15 years after Susan Berman was killed 1,500 miles away... I think it's a publicity stunt.</td></tr>

<h3>Yankees? Tanaka strikes out three in second spring start</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- No news continues to be good news for Masahiro Tanaka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Yankees' ace made his second start of the spring, showing no sign of arm trouble as he works to show the world the partial UCL tear in his right elbow won't affect him during the upcoming season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I try not to put too much expectation on myself," Tanaka said through his translator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I just try to go out there and be the best that I can any time that I take the mound."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tanaka allowed two hits over 3.2 scoreless innings, striking out three without issuing a walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He threw 48 pitches, 29 for strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Overall, I think everything was good," Tanaka said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I think it was as good as my first start."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In two starts, Tanaka has not allowed a run in 5.2 innings, giving up two hits and no walks while striking out five.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I'm pleased with the way he's thrown," Joe Girardi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Since Day 1 of spring training, we've been happy with what we've seen. . . . He appears to be healthy, he's thrown the ball well, and you just keep running him out there and keep building him up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Tanaka retired all six batters he faced in his debut last Thursday, looking very much like the pitcher who dominated opposing hitters for the first three months of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He picked up Wednesday right where he left off, retiring the Braves in order in the first inning while striking out two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Tanaka allowed his first hit of the spring in the second inning, a soft grounder up the middle by A.J. Pierzynski with one out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But Andrelton Simmons followed with a grounder to Didi Gregorius, who stepped on second and fired to first, completing the inning-ending double play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Tanaka threw another 1-2-3 inning in the third, then struck out Eury Perez and retired Jace Peterson in the fourth before Freddie Freeman - who went down swinging in the first on a back-door slider - launched a two-out double to right, ending Tanaka's night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I just wanted to see how everything was working, how everything was coming out of my hand," Tanaka said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I think it was all good tonight."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>After his first start, Tanaka said his arm felt better than it did a year ago, even before he suffered the small ligament tear in July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Girardi noted that the team has altered Tanaka's spring schedule from last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"We've taken it a little bit different this spring, in a sense -maybe a little bit slower, trying to give him plenty of time to get ready," Girardi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Maybe that's why. Maybe he had a better idea of what to expect in spring training, in a sense. He had never been through an American spring training before. Maybe that helped him prepare."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tanaka believes the new routine has benefited him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"It was a plus," Tanaka said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I've been able to build up pretty well thus far. I think it has helped me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Just as Tanaka is making adjustments during his second time through the league, his opponents will inevitably do the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Teams that looked baffled and overmatched against the righthander last season now have first-hand experience against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The rest of the league has more video to use in scouting Tanaka, although Girardi believes teams that have not faced him will still be at a disadvantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"You can watch a lot of video, but it doesn't necessarily give you a real idea what it looks like when you're facing him," Girardi said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Guys can watch video and say a guy throws 93, but what is his 93 like? Some 93s look slower, some look harder. You've really got to get in the box.</td></tr>
