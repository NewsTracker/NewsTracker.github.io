<h3>EU shows little appetite for more Russia sanctions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Most ministers at an EU meeting in the Latvian capital pinned their hopes on the latest Minsk agreement succeeding and said the EU should only consider tightening sanctions if the ceasefire was seriously violated, such as by a separatist offensive on the Ukrainian port of Mariupol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Both Kiev and pro-Russia separatists have accused each other of violence since last month's peace accord called for heavy weapons to be withdrawn from the frontline in east Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni saw "encouraging signals" on the ground in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"At the moment we don't need either new sanctions or automatic renewals (of sanctions)," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There is a glimpse of hope since Minsk ... We should do everything now to improve the situation and decide later whether that improvement really happened and we can reduce the sanctions, or if we have to extend them," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The comments reflect divisions within the 28-nation EU over sanctions on Russia, the bloc's biggest energy supplier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While Britain, Poland and the Baltic states take a tough line, many other EU members, including Italy, Austria and Cyprus, are skeptical about sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Alexis Tsipras's election victory in Greece has strengthened the dovish camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A key decision that the EU must face soon is whether to extend economic sanctions against Russia which it adopted for one year last July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Unanimity is required to extend them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on Friday that a debate was going on in the EU, with some countries saying the bloc should state now that it would extend the economic sanctions until the end of the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Others say it would be a bit contradictory to say, on the one hand, Minsk is being applied and on the other hand we are going to go (extend sanctions) until the end of year," Fabius told reporters in Riga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said a decision on whether to extend existing economic sanctions on Russia could wait until around July.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"If Minsk develops positively, then it is likely that nothing new will be done on sanctions," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>If, on the other hand, there were serious violations to Minsk, sanctions remained available, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius, an EU hawk on Russia, said on Friday that extending sanctions to the end of the year was "the least we can do".</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said on Saturday existing sanctions would probably be extended until year-end.</td></tr>

<h3>Russia: 2 suspects detained in murder of Boris Nemtsov</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two suspects have been detained in the killing a week ago of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, the head of Russia's federal security service said Saturday, an announcement received with both skepticism and reserved satisfaction by some of Nemtsov's comrades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tourists hold a poster symbolically showing a Russian flag riddled with bullet holes as they pose for a photo at the place where Boris Nemtsov, a charismatic Russian opposition leader and sharp critic of President Vladimir Putin, was gunned down on Friday, Feb. 27, 2015 near the Kremlin, in Moscow, on Saturday, March 7, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A Russian national flag with a black ribbon flies in the breeze as mourners following the Russian tradition of memorialising a person nine days after a death lay flowers and votive candles at the place where Boris Nemtsov, a charismatic Russian opposition leader and sharp critic of President Vladimir Putin, was gunned down on Friday, Feb. 27, 2015 near the Kremlin, in Moscow, on Saturday, March 7, 2015, with the Kremlin Wall and St. Basil's Cathedral are in the background.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mourners following the Russian tradition of memorializing a person nine days after a death lay flowers and votive candles at the place where Boris Nemtsov, a charismatic Russian opposition leader and sharp critic of President Vladimir Putin, was gunned down on Friday, Feb. 27, 2015 near the Kremlin, in Moscow, on Saturday, March 7, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>MOSCOW (AP) - Russia's security service head said Saturday that two suspects in the killing of leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov have been detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Russian news reports later cited an official as saying one of them had served with police troops in Chechnya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The short and vague announcement of the detentions by Federal Security Service director Alexander Bortnikov prompted only skepticism and weak satisfaction from his comrades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Bortnikov, in comments shown on state television, said the two suspects were from Russia's North Caucasus region, but gave no details other than their names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He said they were "suspected of carrying out this crime," but it wasn't clear if either of the suspects was believed to have fired the shots that killed Nemtsov as he and a companion walked over a bridge near the Kremlin on Feb. 27.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>No charges were immediately announced, but the two were expected appear in a Moscow court on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bortnikov didn't say where the detentions took place, how they were conducted or what led agents to the suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>However, the state news agencies Tass and RIA Novosti said they were detained in Ingushetia, a republic bordering Chechnya, citing Ingush Security Council chief Albert Barakhoev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>One of them, Zaur Dadaev, served in a battalion of Interior Ministry troops in Chechnya, Barakhoev was quoted as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said the other, Anzor Gubashev, had worked in a private security company in Moscow, according to the reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Barakhoev also was quoted by RIA Novosti as saying two others were seized at the same time as the suspects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But there has been no official announcement of their detention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Dadaev's mother, Aimani, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying the two others were her nephews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nemtsov's killing shocked Russia's already beleaguered and marginalized opposition supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Suspicion in the opposition is high that the killing was ordered by the Kremlin in retaliation for Nemtsov's adamant criticism of President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The 55-year-old Nemtsov was working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Russia's top investigative body said it was investigating several possible motives, including that he was killed in an attempt to smear Putin's image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It also said it was looking into possible connections to Islamic extremism and Nemtsov's personal life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Chechnya, where Dadaev reportedly worked, was wracked by two wars over the past 20 years between Russian forces and separatists increasingly allied with fundamentalist Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Although the insurgency died down in Chechnya several years ago, attacks attributed to Islamic militants sporadically occur in nearby regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Chechnya's strongman Kremlin-backed president Ramzan Kadyrov has imposed an Islam-tinged rule on the region, including the mandatory wearing of headscarves by women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Kadyrov, himself a former rebel, has been widely accused of rampant human rights abuses including executions and abductions of opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Many believe that Nemtsov's death in a tightly secured area near the Kremlin wouldn't have been possible without official involvement, and could be an attempt to scare other government foes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Putin, who had dubbed Nemtsov's killing a "provocation," made no comment on the detentions announced Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>One of Nemtsov's closest allies in the opposition, Ilya Yashin, said on Facebook that "It's hard to judge whether these are the real performers or if the investigation went down a false track."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In any case, he said, "it's extremely important that the matter not be limited to detention of the shooters, whether these are the real killers or not. The key task is the identification and detention of who ordered" the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"For the time being, it's very skimpy information, which tells us little, but it's good that the first results of the investigation has appeared," another opposition leader, former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, was quoted as telling the news agency Interfax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In some previous killings of Kremlin critics, especially the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006, there has been wide criticism that those who ordered the killing haven't been identified or prosecuted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Four Chechens were among the five convicted in Politkovskaya's killing, which was widely believed to be in retaliation for her criticism of Kadyrov and Russia's actions in Chechnya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Kremlin critics say the spiteful nationalist propaganda on state television, which cast Nemtsov and other liberals as Western stooges, helped prepare the ground for his killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Nemtsov was walking with a young Ukrainian woman, Anna Duritskaya, when he was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The woman has returned to Ukraine after questioning by police and the state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday quoted her lawyer Vadim Prokhorov as saying she hasn't been called back to Russia for testimony in connection with the detentions.</td></tr>
