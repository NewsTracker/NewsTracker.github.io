<tr><td>3</td><td>Jeffrey Sterling of O'Fallon, Missouri, will be sentenced next month in Alexandria after his conviction in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A jury found him guilty of illegally disclosing to journalist James Risen a secret mission to stall Iran's nuclear-weapons program by feeding them deliberately flawed blueprints.</td></tr>
