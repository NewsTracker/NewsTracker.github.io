<h3>​Edward Snowden ‘would love to return’ to Geneva, makes public appeal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Calling it a "great political option," he said that he dreamed of going to Geneva, where he used to work undercover for the CIA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I would love to return to Switzerland, some of my favorite memories are from Geneva. It's a wonderful place," Snowden told the International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights on Thursday night, when he was asked about seeking asylum, Reuters reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I do think Switzerland would be a sort of great political option because it has a history of neutrality," he added, speaking from Moscow by video link to a Geneva audience, which had just watched "Citizenfour", an Oscar-winning documentary based on the story of the former US spy agency contractor on the run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Snowden reminded the Swiss that he had applied for asylum to 21 countries, "the majority in central and Western Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The United States canceled his passport and he had to stay in limbo at a Russian airport, where he was stopped from going to Ecuador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Unfortunately no country said yes," he said, blaming the Obama administration's "political interference."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>31-year-old Snowden worked at the US diplomatic mission in Geneva from March 2007 to February 2009, wire-tapping communications systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>At that time, under an online username "TheTrueHOOHA", Snowden shared his views on life in Switzerland with fellow Americans, saying that it was "like living in a post card," but also "nightmarishly expensive and horrifically classist," as cited by The Local.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Current Swiss law requires an applicant to be in Switzerland to lodge an asylum request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In his speech, Snowden also pointed out that a "fair trial" could be the only reason for him to return to his motherland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said, "I am working very hard with my lawyers to try to get reliable guarantees of a fair trial. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice is unwilling to agree. The only thing they have said at this point is that they would not execute me, which is not the same as a fair trial."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Snowden is wanted by the US on charges of espionage and theft of government property after leaking a vast trove of classified material to journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The whistleblower's revelations lifted the lid of secrecy on a vast range of the National Security Agency's global spying operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Snowden arrived in Moscow on the evening of June 24, 2013, on a flight from Hong Kong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He had intended to catch a connecting flight to Cuba.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>However, his passport was revoked by the US, leaving him stranded in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He was granted asylum for one year in Russia in August 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A year later, Snowden received a Russian residence permit, which is valid for three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>This period started on August 1, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Snowden has been the recipient of the German 'Whistleblower Prize,' the Sam Adams Award which was presented to him in Moscow, the German 'positive' Big Brother Award, the Ridenhour Truth-Telling Prize, and the Fritz Bauer Prize.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Snowden inspired not only Laura Poitras, director of the Oscar-winning CitizenFour documentary, but also another US director, veteran filmmaker Oliver Stone, to turn his story into fiction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Stone has purchased the rights to both "The Snowden Files," a 2014 book about the NSA leaks written by Guardian journalist Luke Harding, and "Time of the Octopus," a novel based loosely on the Snowden saga penned by the former contractor's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena.</td></tr>

<h3>TV election debates 'will go ahead'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It means Mr Cameron - who has rejected a head-to-head debate with Ed Miliband - could be "empty chaired".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Miliband said it was "judgement day" for the prime minister, who was "a weak leader running from his record".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Downing Street said it would not back down on its "final offer" of one seven-way debate in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Cameron's communications chief Craig Oliver said it was "disappointing" that the broadcasters were not prepared to take up the prime minister's offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I am ready to discuss at your convenience the logistics of making the debate we have suggested happen," he added in a written response to the broadcasters' decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Downing Street has blamed the broadcasters for "chaotic" negotiations, which have gone on for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Miliband said: "I think the broadcasters are absolutely right to reserve the right to empty chair the prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"These debates don't belong to him; they don't belong to me. They belong to the British people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"He should stop ducking and weaving. He should stop running scared. He should agree to these debates."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg urged David Cameron to drop his objections, tweeting: "You haven't got your own way so accept it and take part."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This is a defiant move by the broadcasters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They could have chosen to blink and accept the "final offer" made by Number 10 on Wednesday and end the negotiation saga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Instead, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky have said they will continue with three debates in April as planned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They have made it clear all the debates will happen regardless of whether invited parties turn up or not - and today described the head-to-head debate, with Mr Cameron and and Miliband, as "vital".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But proceeding without Mr Cameron would be a massive step for the broadcasters to take.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>And to complicate matters further the one-on-one contest would have to comply with the broadcasters' own rules on fairness and balance - perhaps the basis of a challenge from Number 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Downing Street is adamant that it is the broadcasters who have badly mishandled the whole process and that it is "disappointing" that they have not accepted the prime minster's final offer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But Mr Miliband said it was "make your mind up time" for Mr Cameron - and the ball is back in Downing Street's court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: "I am pleased that the broadcasters have stood firm at last, but it would have been far better had they stuck with their original proposal which included fewer parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Nonetheless we accept the challenge."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: "A Tory prime minister simply cannot be allowed to dictate terms to everyone else taking part."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Green leader Natalie Bennett said Mr Cameron's refusal to take part in the debates as planned was further damaging the reputation of politics and the proposed format was "very fair".</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said: "I'm delighted that the broadcasters are holding firm. It would have been wrong for one individual to dictate and change the terms of these debates."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But Peter Robinson, leader of the DUP and First Minister of Northern Ireland, said the debate negotiations had been the "greatest electoral shambles of all time".</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"Just who do the broadcasters think they are, that they can set down a diktat?" he told Sky News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Cameron has raised concerns about the exclusion of the DUP from the broadcasters' plans but the BBC Trust has rejected calls for it to reconsider their participation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Sky, the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV have invited the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, UKIP, the SNP, the Green Party of England and Wales and Plaid Cymru to take part in two debates lasting two hours each during the election campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>As it stands, the broadcasters have said the debates will go ahead as originally planned on 2 and 16 April, while a planned head-to-head encounter between the Conservative and Labour leaders will also continue on 30 April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In a joint letter to Craig Oliver, the four broadcasters said they believed their proposal was more suitable than the one debate proposed by the prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"We have given your proposal serious consideration but we don't think it achieves the goal of providing our viewers with election debates that can properly explore a reasonably full range of issues," they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>They added: "We very much hope that all invited leaders will participate in the broadcast debates. However, in the end all we can do - as impartial public service broadcasters - is to provide a fair forum for debates to take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"It will always remain the decision of individual leaders whether or not to take part."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The broadcasters said they would be prepared to meet Mr Cameron or his representatives for talks on the way forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Home Secretary Theresa May has been speaking about the dangers of children being groomed online by extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In light of the recent stories about teenagers heading to Syria to join the Islamic State (IS) Ms May called on mothers and fathers to become more aware of what their children got up to online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>During a ministerial visit in the Welsh capital, she said: "I think that parents don't sometimes realise the impact of the internet and particularly social media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"Sometimes they don't know what interactions their children are having and what is going on can be effectively unseen by parents. One of the messages that I want to give to parents is that if you are concerned they might be being radicalised or if they might be thinking of going to Syria to join terrorist groups please say something as soon possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"UKIP are a weather-changing party... but one which bounces off internal turbulence. With three incidents today, it will be intriguing to see whether it affects their standing. They seem to defy gravity - these kinds of headlines don't seem to make a difference."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>An article gaining interest at politicshome.com highlights the latest research carried out by Survation for the Daily Record, which puts the SNP on 47% to Labour's 26%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>If that were replicated at the general election it would see Nicola Sturgeon's party pick up 53 out of 59 Scottish Westminster seats, while the Lib Dems would be left with just one MP in Scotland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The former Liberal leader, Lord Steel, says "the most" Liberal Democrats would accept in another hung parliament is a "confidence and supply" deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>With polls predicting no clear winner at May's general election, the Liberal Democrats could be called upon to shore up a Conservative- or Labour-led government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Lord Steel, who agreed the Lib-Lab pact with Jim Callaghan's government in the 1970s, told The Week in Parliament there was a "general feeling" the Liberal Democrats needed to "recharge our values".</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"I'm pretty certain that the mood in the party will be to say the very most we would accept would be confidence and supply," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"I don't think there will be a mood in the party to go into another coalition with either party," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Campaigners say proposals to bring back a ban on identifying people arrested for sexual offences in England and Wales would "institutionalise the myth that lots of women lie about rape".</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Lisa Longstaff, from Women Against Rape, told BBC News the cross-party group of MPs calling for the change had been influenced by celebrities and that such a ban would prevent other victims from coming forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The Home Affairs Committee says the names of suspects should not be published by the media until they're charged - unless police believe there are "exceptional" circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Asked "What is British-ness?", the panel seem almost united, mentioning tolerance, fair play, respect for individuals and freedom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Mark Littlewood says there is a "strand of small-l liberalism, live-and-live attitude to people that is shared across the political spectrum".</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>On the subject of whether suspects of sex crimes should remain anonymous until they are charged - which is an idea mooted by the Home Affairs Select Committee - Labour's Chris Leslie says he thinks it "legitimate" in a case where there are multiple victims "that we do have to have some of that information available".</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>But he accepts that it is a difficult issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Tory Patrick McLoughlin wades in, and makes reference to the case of BBC presenter Paul Gambaccini who was put through what was described as "12 months of trauma", and then never charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>"That is just not acceptable, once that air of suspicion comes over somebody and then is not charged," says Mr McLoughlin, but he adds "but I don't want to see anything that stops prosecutions taking place".</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt says she and other female politicians have suffered attacks on social media and elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Some had had a "dreadful time for their faith, size.. the way they dress".</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>It had to be stopped, she said and the perpetrators charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Jonathan Dimbleby pressed the Conservative and Labour politicians on where they would cut and where they would find money, asking "Will you tell people where the cuts will come or not?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs, says there needs to be "some more frank discussions in the run up the election", adding: "We've got to be honest with pensioners and say 'Your pensions are going to rise in line with inflation but we are already borrowing money from ... the next generation and the un-conceived, and that has to stop'."</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt says the party thinks it can alter the TV licence and winter fuel allowance for better-off pensioners and that the party will set out its departmental cut plans before the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>David Dimbleby says there were only eight Lib Dems in the Commons for the "yellow budget", but Tessa Munt says many were busy working in their constituencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie MP tells Any Questions in the budget the Chancellor "wanted you to go away thinking everything is fantastic...only problem is, that is not the experience everyone is having".</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>He said the main area of difference between Labour and the coalition was in dealing with the deficit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin MP said every Labour government had left office with higher unemployment levels than when it came in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>There are many areas where we have made advances, he said, but there is more to do and we have to pay back some of the debt Labour ran up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Starting shortly is Any Questions with Jonathan Dimbleby and guests from Aston University in Birmingham.</td></tr>

<tr><td>70</td><td>He told a rally at the party's Scottish conference in Aberdeen the Liberal Democrats had shown "incredible resilience in the past five years", and this had helped them to achieve "incredible things".</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>He said: "That resilience will see off the SNP challenge in the seats we hold. And it will wipe the smile off Alex Salmond's face in Gordon too."</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Across at the Independent, journalist Duncan Exley is providing some analysis to this week's Budget.</td></tr>
