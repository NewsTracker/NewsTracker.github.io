<h3>France mulls offering asylum to Julian Assange and Edward Snowden</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>France's Justice Minister has canvassed possible asylum for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden as WikiLeaks and French newspapers promise further revelations of US espionage against the French government and private companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Justice Minister Christiane Taubira said on Thursday that she "wouldn't be surprised" if France decided to offer political asylum to Mr Assange, who is living at Ecuador's embassy in London, and Mr Snowden, who remains in exile in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>WikiLeaks, in collaboration with the French daily newspaper Liberation and the news website Mediapart, this week published leaked US National Security Agency (NSA) intelligence reports that revealed the US intercepted the communications of three successive French presidents between 2006 and at least 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If France decides to offer asylum to Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, I wouldn't be surprised. It's a possibility," Ms Taubira said in a television interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She stressed that any decision to grant asylum would not be for her, but would be taken by French President Francois Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden in Moscow on October 9, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The top-secret NSA documents published by WikiLeaks included summaries of intercepted conversations by Mr Hollande relating to Greece's possible departure from the Eurozone and his government's relationship with Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Hollande convened a meeting of France's Defence Council, while the French government summoned the US ambassador to discuss the evidence that the US had spied on its close ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>France won't tolerate "any action jeopardising its security and the protection of its interests", the Defence Council said in a statement on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"These unacceptable facts already resulted in clarifications between France and the United States [in 2013 and 2014]," the Defence Council said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Commitments were made by the American authorities. They must be recalled and strictly respected."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>WikiLeaks tweeted on Friday that there will be a further "major revelation on Monday".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Liberation editor Laurent Joffrin also confirmed his paper would publish "more specific things about political espionage".</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It will not be about the presidents, it will be on the political life," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Asked at a press conference whether there would be revelations about economic espionage, Mr Joffrin suggested that it would take time to assess the large volume of leaked intelligence material fully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"There are many documents; if they are all out all of a sudden, it's a book, practically," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"We must find the context and decrypt abbreviations. We need intelligence specialists."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Although WikiLeaks has not indicated the source of the leaked material, the disclosures suggest the group has obtained access to the massive trove of intelligence material leaked by Mr Snowden in May 2013 or else other US intelligence material of similar sensitivity and importance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Assange has lived in Ecuador's London embassy since June 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He is wanted in Sweden for questioning about sexual assault allegations that were raised by two Swedish women in August 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>However, the South American country granted him asylum on the grounds that he is at risk of extradition to the US to face espionage and conspiracy charges arising from the leaking of secret documents by US Army private Chelsea Manning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>WikiLeaks is the subject of an investigation by the US Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>British police are on guard outside the embassy, ready to arrest Mr Assange so he can be extradited to Sweden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Assange denies the allegations and his lawyers have advised that he is at risk of extradition to the US from both Sweden and Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>WikiLeaks assisted Mr Snowden's travel from Hong Kong to Moscow where he has been given temporary asylum by the Russian government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He is subject to a US arrest warrant for espionage charges, including "unauthorised communication of national defence information" and "wilful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorised person".</td></tr>
