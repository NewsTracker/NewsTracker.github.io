<h3>On 5th anniversary of health care law, no end to debate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The White House ceremony on March 23, 2010, was an applause-filled celebration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"When I sign this bill," Obama said, "all of the overheated rhetoric over reform will finally confront the reality of reform."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the polemic around "Obamacare" hasn't cooled much, and the permanence of the president's achievement remains in question as the nation awaits the outcome of a Supreme Court case that could jeopardize insurance for nearly 8 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Then: 49.9 million people were uninsured in 2010, according to the Census Bureau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now: That's down significantly, to somewhere between 30 million and 40 million people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The administration recently estimated that 16.4 million adults have gained insurance since the law's coverage provisions took effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Measuring differently, data from a large daily survey called the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index suggests a more modest impact: The uninsured rate dropped from 16.3 percent in early 2010 to 12.3 percent this year among adults 18-64, which translates to about 9.7 million fewer uninsured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the law's precise impact may not be clear for a few years, partly because census surveys take time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Then: Insurers could deny coverage to people with health conditions or charge them higher premiums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Now: Insurers can't ask about someone's medical history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But they can charge smokers more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Then: Health insurance was available to most people, but the government didn't require them to have it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Now: The law requires nearly all Americans to have coverage, either through an employer, a government program or by buying their own policies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The uninsured risk IRS fines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Then: In April 2010, 46 percent had a favorable view of the law, while 40 percent had an unfavorable opinion, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Now: Naysayers have an edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Forty-three percent have an unfavorable opinion, while 41 percent have a favorable view, according to Kaiser's latest poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>About 3 in 5 said the law has had no impact on their family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The rest are divided almost equally between the 19 percent who said they were helped and the 22 percent who said they have been hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Then: Democrats ran both chambers of Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the House and Harry Reid was Senate majority leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Now: Republicans are back in charge after Democratic losses in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Opposition to "Obamacare" was a motivator for conservative voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Pelosi and Reid are minority leaders in their respective chambers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Then: Losing health insurance was a rite of passage for young adults; insurers routinely dropped them from parental coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Now: Young adults can remain on a parent's plan until they turn 26, whether or not they are students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Then: People who bought their own health insurance had to pay the full cost - making it unaffordable for many.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Now: Insurance exchanges like HealthCare.gov offer subsidized coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Then: The final legislation cut a provision that would have authorized Medicare to pay doctors for counseling patients about what kind of care they would want in the last stages of a serious illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Now: Medicare is considering a regulation to allow payment for end-of-life counseling and has asked for public comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Such counseling would be voluntary, and the idea has wide support in the medical community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Then: At a rally near Cleveland days before the bill passed in 2010, Obama claimed employers would see premiums plummet, "which means they could give you a raise."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That year, annual premiums for employer-sponsored insurance averaged $5,049 for employee-only coverage and $13,770 for a family plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's employer survey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Now: Premiums for job-based insurance have gone up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>They averaged $6,025 for employee-only coverage in 2014, the most recent year available from Kaiser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Family coverage averaged $16,834.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The employee share also went up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Supporters of the law say premiums have risen more slowly than would have otherwise been the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>But employers have kept shifting costs to workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The average annual deductible for single coverage was $1,217 in 2014, up from $917 in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Then: The 2010 Medicare trustees report estimated that spending cuts and tax increases in the health care law would extend the life of the program's giant hospital trust fund to 2029.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Before, it was expected to run out in 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Now: The 2014 Medicare trustees report estimated that the trust fund will be exhausted in 2030.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Slowing medical inflation has helped Medicare, even as baby boomers reaching age 65 are flocking to enroll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The health care law's cuts haven't had the dire consequences that many seniors feared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Congress has passed even more spending reductions since 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Medicare's long-term future remains uncertain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Then: Even before Obama signed the law, conservatives were preparing a constitutional challenge to its requirement that individuals carry health insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>A divided Supreme Court upheld the mandate in 2012, ruling that the penalty for not complying works like a tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>However, the court gave states the option to reject the law's Medicaid expansion.</td></tr>
