<tr><td>4</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - Top Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, head of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, has escaped from a maximum security prison for the second time, Mexican officials said as they launched a manhunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Guzman was last seen about 9 p.m. Saturday in the shower area of the Altiplano prison, 90 kilometers (56 miles) outside of Mexico City, according to a statement from the National Security Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He went to the shower area but after some time was lost by security camera surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Upon checking his cell, authorities found it was empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A search operation began immediately in the surrounding area and highways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Flights were also suspended at Toluca airport, near the penitentiary in the state of Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Guzman was captured in February 2014 after more than a decade on the run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He was listed as 56 years old at the time, though there are varying dates for his birth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He faces multiple federal drug trafficking indictments in the U.S. and was on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's most-wanted list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>During his time as a fugitive, Guzman transformed himself from a middling Mexican capo into arguably the most powerful drug trafficker in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>His fortune grew to be estimated at more than $1 billion, according to Forbes magazine, which listed him among the "World's Most Powerful People" and ranked him above the presidents of France and Venezuela.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>His Sinaloa Cartel empire still stretches throughout North America and reaches as far away as Europe and Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The cartel has been heavily involved in the bloody drug war that has torn through parts of Mexico for the last decade, taking at least an estimated 100,000 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sinaloa is believed now to control most of the major crossing points for drugs at the U.S. border with Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Guzman was caught by authorities for the first time in Guatemala in 1993, extradited and sentenced to 20 years in prison in Mexico for murder and drug trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He escaped from another maximum security prison, Puente Grande in western Jalisco state, in 2001 with the help of prison guards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The lore said he escaped in laundry cart, though there were several versions of how he got away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Guzman was known for his ability to pay off local residents and even authorities who would tip him off to security operations launched for his capture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He finally was tracked down to a modest beachside high-rise in the Pacific Coast resort city of Mazatlan on Feb. 22, 2014, where he had been hiding with his wife and twin daughters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He was taken in the early morning without a shot fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But before they reached him, security forces went on a several-day chase through Culiacan, the capital of his home Sinaloa state, for which the cartel is named.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They found houses where Guzman supposedly had been staying with steel-enforced doors and elaborate tunnels that allowed him to escape through the sewer system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Earlier this year, former Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam told The Associated Press that sending Guzman to the United States, where he is wanted, would save Mexico a lot of money, but keeping him in Mexico was a question of national sovereignty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He dismissed concerns that Guzman could escape a second time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>That risk "does not exist," Murillo Karam said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He has since been replaced by Arely Gomez as attorney general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mexican officials had no immediate comment, but have scheduled a press conference for 7 a.m. local time.</td></tr>
