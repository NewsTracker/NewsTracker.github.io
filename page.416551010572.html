<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The death toll climbed above 3,300 on Monday, two days after a magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck central Nepal and surrounding regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>How much higher the death toll would rise depends on the state of remote Himalayan villages that rescue workers were still trying to reach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Many of the roads are believed to be cut off by landslides, making it likely that some of these communities can only be reached by helicopter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The earthquake hit the capital, Kathmandu, but its impact spread far beyond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At least 18 people died on the slopes of Mount Everest, where avalanches buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Another 61 people were killed in neighboring India, and China reported 20 people dead in Tibet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nearly 100 aftershocks, including a magnitude-6.7 temblor Sunday, have hindered rescue efforts and terrorized residents sleeping in open squares and parks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kathmandu is full of small, poorly constructed brick apartment buildings, and the quake destroyed swaths of the oldest neighborhoods, even as more modern structures stood firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Most areas were without power and water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The quake was the worst to hit Nepal in at least 80 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nepal's worst recorded earthquake in 1934 measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>The first nations to respond were Nepal's neighbors - India, China and Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The United States, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Germany, France, Poland, Italy, Israel and Singapore also sent aid.</td></tr>
