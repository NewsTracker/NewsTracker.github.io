<tr><td>3</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - The spirit of Oscar de la Renta lives on every day at the Cannes Film Festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Though the Dominican Republic-born fashion designer passed away last year aged 82 after battling cancer, his landmark fashion designs continue to dominate the red carpet - from Emma Stone's black sheer tulle gown at the "The Irrational Man" photocall to Aishwarya Rai's maroon silk number and Karlie Kloss' incredible blue fishtail gown at the De Grisogono soiree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Now a documentary film has been screened at Cannes, called "Ovation for Oscar," paying homage to his work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Featuring US Vogue Editor Anna Wintour and his window, Annette de la Renta, the 20-minute film, directed by Ryan Curtis, is a behind-the-scenes look at the first posthumous exhibit of the designer's work at the SCAD college of art and design, with which the late designer was closely involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"When Oscar de la Renta passed there was an outpouring of love," said Curtis, adding that he relished the chance to pay homage to the designer via the prism of the college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The film shows the creation of the exhibit through the eyes of a bright-eyed young student, who looks in wonder at the myriad designs - including Hillary Clinton's famous red dress that graced the cover of Vogue in 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Each dress that he created, the film notes, captures the unique essence of each woman it was tailored for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He's one of the last old masters. He loved each individual woman, and that's his genius," Curtis said.</td></tr>
