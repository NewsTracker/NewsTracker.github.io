<h3>Germanwings co-pilot may have spiked pilot's drink with diuretic, report says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The UK Daily Telegraph, citing German newspaper Express.de, reports that 27-year-old Lubitz may have mixed a drug into Captain Patrick Sondheimer's drink, causing him to need to use the restroom and consequently leaving Lubitz alone in the cockpit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Other reports suggest that Lubitz searched online for information about diuretics in the days leading up to the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, the Telegraph notes that the reports appear to be based on speculation, with no evidence that Lubitz bought the drugs in question or took them onboard the doomed flight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Investigators believe that Sondheimer was locked out of the cockpit by Lubitz after the captain left to go to the bathroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sondheimer is heard on the cockpit voice recorder banging on the door and demanding to be let in moments before the plane crashed into a mountainside, killing all 150 on board the March 24 flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf.</td></tr>
