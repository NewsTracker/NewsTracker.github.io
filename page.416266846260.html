<h3>Mets put 3B David Wright on 15-day DL, recall Eric Campbell (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The New York Mets put their captain on the 15-day DL with a strained right hamstring Wednesday after the seven-time All-Star was injured while stealing second base the night before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The team expects him back within three weeks, general manager Sandy Alderson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''It's disappointing anytime you have to go on the DL and miss games,'' Wright said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It's the latest significant injury for Wright, who has had trouble staying healthy the past five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The third baseman played through pain in 2014 until his season was cut short Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>9 because of persistent inflammation in his left shoulder that contributed to the worst offensive production of his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was sidelined almost seven weeks late in the 2013 season with a strained right hamstring and limited to 102 games in 2011 by a stress fracture in his lower back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 32-year-old is under contract through 2020 after signing an eight-year deal worth $138 million, the richest in franchise history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Eric Campbell was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas to fill in at third, a job he performed admirably in Wright's absence last season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Campbell batted sixth Wednesday night as the Mets (5-3) tried for a three-game sweep of Philadelphia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''It'll be tough to try to replace him, but I'll just try to do what I can do,'' Campbell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Travis d'Arnaud moved up to No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>2 in the lineup, where Wright had been hitting this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wright was off to a solid start at .333 with a home run and four RBIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He and the Mets were hoping for a fully healthy season after the longtime slugger batted .269 with eight homers and 63 RBIs last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Wright had an MRI at the Hospital for Special Surgery and received a cortisone shot Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He has a mild strain and will rest for two days before resuming baseball activities ''as tolerated,''' the Mets said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''By the end of the homestand we should have a pretty good idea of where he's at,'' manager Terry Collins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There was good news for New York regarding cleanup hitter Michael Cuddyer, back in the lineup after leaving Tuesday night's game when he was hit by a pitch on the left hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Young shortstop Wilmer Flores also got plunked on the left hand, but remained in the game and said he's fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''I think the team as a whole will respond well to this,'' Alderson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Campbell, a jack-of-all-trades who can play all over the diamond, batted .263 with three homers and 16 RBIs in 85 games for New York last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>He was left off the opening-day roster this season only because the Mets decided to carry eight relievers early on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Campbell made the most of his regular at-bats at Las Vegas, going 11 for 20 (.550) with two home runs, two doubles and a triple in six games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''We're getting him at a good time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He's red hot,'' Collins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Summoned back to the big leagues, Campbell flew from Sacramento, California, to Las Vegas on Tuesday night and then from Las Vegas to New York on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>He went to Citi Field straight from the airport, but arrived in plenty of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Nicknamed ''Soup,'' Campbell said he was happy to be back but acknowledged this wasn't the way he wanted to return.</td></tr>
