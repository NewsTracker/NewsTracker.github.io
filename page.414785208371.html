<h3>Judges who handed death sentences to Bali Nine ringleaders asked for bribes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Bali Nine duo could be executed within the week, with a meeting on Monday to advise the Australian embassy of the formalities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But the pair's lawyers will seek a meeting with Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo on Monday to ask for the executions to be delayed, pending further legal challenges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The team has made a complaint with the Indonesian Judicial Commission, based on public comments by Chan and Sukumaran's former lawyer, Muhammad Rifan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr Rifan last week alleged there had been 'interference' in the case that saw the Australians sentenced to death when they should have been jailed for life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He then went overseas without detailing his allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, their lawyers now allege the six judges who sentenced Chan and Sukumaran to death were 'willing to give a lighter sentence than the death penalty to (Chan and Sukumaran) if the (judges) were given a sum of money'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Brisbane Times said that in an extraordinary statement after visiting the men inside Kerobokan prison, Mr Rifan said he was prepared to 'take the heat' and provide the 'never revealed evidence' to Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's current lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>'It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But for them I will take it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>I told Myuran it's okay,' Mr Rifan said cryptically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Following his dramatic, if imprecise, comments, Mr Rifan left Indonesia to travel to Mecca for a religious pilgrimage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But as the Bali Nine pair on death row come to terms with their imminent execution, the Indonesian justice system is being accused of hypocrisy after a local ice manufacturer avoided the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali, local kingpin Hangky Gunawan has been given only a jail sentence for a similar crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Despite hundreds of pleas for clemency for Sukumaran and Chan, Indonesian president Joko Widodo maintains that his hard-line stance against drug dealers will not budge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the story of Hangky Gunawan, an Indonesian ice manufacturer who was convicted in 2007 and was handed the death penalty before his appeal - which followed directly after the Bali Nine duos' - won him both a reduced sentence and most importantly, his life, Fairfax reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>This is despite Gunwan, who owned the drug-producing business based in Surabaya, East Java, and organised ice's distribution, was caught by police with over 11kg of the drug.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>When Chan and Sukumaran lodged their final appeal to the Supreme Court in Jakarta in 2011, numbered case 37 and 38, Gunwan's appeal for life was directly after theirs, numbered 39.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But while the Australians' judicial review were rejected, in Gunwan's it was decided that the death penalty violated both the Indonesian constitution, the country's human rights and quoted the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to Fairfax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>His prison sentence was subsequently reduced to 12 years and Gunwan was saved from execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The result presents a stark contrast to the trials endured by Chan and Sukumaran who are expected to be moved to Nusa Kambangan - a prison island off central Java - where prisoners on death row are executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>From there they will be given 72 hours' notice of their execution by firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also called out Indonesia's justice system for its hypocrisy after Mr Widodo offered 'optimum protection' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>'I should also just observe today that millions of Australians are feeling very, very upset about what may soon happen to two Australians in Indonesia,' Mr Abbott said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has confirmed it has invited all embassies with citizens to be executed this month to a meeting on the formalities on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A date for the executions won't be provided at the meeting, but the provision of 72 hours notice will be discussed, as well as access to the prisoners for family and logistics over foreign media coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>When Indonesia executed five foreign nationals last month, the meeting with relevant embassies took place one day before Attorney-General HM Prasetyo announced the execution date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That announcement signalled the 72-hour notice period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>But in this case, the prisoners have to be transferred from jails all over Indonesia to the execution location, Nusakambangan island, off Central Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Authorities have permission to move Chan and Sukumaran from Bali's Kerobokan jail, but haven't set a date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Friday suggested the depth of feeling in Australia is so strong that Australians may boycott Indonesia if the executions go ahead, but she denied that she was urging for a boycott.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>'I knew that there was very deep concern in the Australian public about the likely executions of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan, and that Australians will make their own decisions as to whether they want to travel to a country that does have the death penalty,' Ms Bishop told Macquarie Radio on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Boycott calls were growing on social media before Ms Bishop's remarks and politicians have received a flood of letters about the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Ms Bishop's opposition counterpart Tanya Plibersek told the Seven Network she didn't think this was helpful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>'I'm really not sure that boycotting Bali is going to make much of a difference to the attitude in Jakarta,' Ms Plibersek said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran have been disturbed by the evident preparation for their execution as prison guards broke open the lock to their jail cells to conduct a search.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Artist Ben Quilty says Sukumaran is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Quilty said goodbye the 33-year-old to at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>'He knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>I offered to bring him valium but he said 'no'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>He is completely free from drugs and won't even take sleeping pills,' Quilty told ABC radio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The Australian artist, who in 2011 won the Archibald Prize, has been Sukumaran's mentor since 2012, helping him develop a talent for painting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Australia's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed, along with desperate legal bids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Their Sydney families are in Bali, where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in Kerobokan jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Over the past decade they've been imprisoned there, Chan and Sukumaran have transformed into model inmates, who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug-free.</td></tr>

<h3>Ukraine Ceasefire Holds Despite Sporadic Gunfire</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ceasefire in Ukraine appears to be holding despite occasional shelling and gunfire close to a flashpoint town in the country's east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Artillery and mortar fire has been heard around Debaltseve, a strategically important town on the frontline of the fight between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The guns fell silent early on Sunday morning as a ceasefire agreement came into effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The agreement was reached following talks in the Belarus capital Minsk, led by France and Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pro-Russian rebels indicated that they would not observe the truce at Debaltseve, where Ukrainian forces have been largely surrounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Senior rebel commander Eduard Basurin said: "Of course we can open fire (on Debaltseve). It is our territory."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A statement released by Kiev said the "enemy" was carrying out attacks in the region using Grad rockets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It said the military had a plan to try to re-take control of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In Paris, French President Francois Hollande declared that observance of the ceasefire was "generally satisfactory" despite some "local incidents".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Hollande spoke to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in a four-way phone call with the leaders of Germany and Russia on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Poroshenko emphasised in the call that the ceasefire should be implemented all along the frontline, "including the area of Debaltseve," according to a statement from his office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is responsible for monitoring the ceasefire, said rebels had denied observers access to Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The town sits astride a railway junction in a pocket of territory between the two main rebel strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In the main rebel centre, Donetsk, artillery fire was reported every few seconds in the hours before the ceasefire, but halted at midnight local time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The ceasefire, negotiated in all-night talks involving Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany on Thursday, preludes the creation of a buffer zone and the withdrawal of heavy weapons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict that has led to sanctions against Russia, which the West accuses of transporting weapons and troops into Ukraine - a claim Russia denies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The United Nations Security Council has so far failed to adopt a resolution calling on all parties to implement the ceasefire deal, despite a frenzy of diplomatic activity.</td></tr>
