<h3>Celebrity stylist Garren shutters luxe salon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Stylist to the stars Garren (no last name needed) abruptly shuttered his namesake salon at the Sherry-Netherland hotel in January, as reported by Page Six.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Two months later, his forgotten staffers continue to sharpen their scissors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Employees are still enraged at Garren because they haven't been paid for [several months' salary]," a former Garren-ite tells Threads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Another stranded staffer says Garren didn't even inform his employees that the salon would be closing for good; instead, "Someone else called and said not to come to work on New Year's Day because they have an electrical problem."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rumor on the street is that tax delinquency led to the surprise closure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>According to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, as of Feb. 18, 2015, Garren owes $504,387.42 in back taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Regardless, Garren's reputation hasn't suffered among a certain set of chichi Upper East Siders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>When the stylist isn't basking in the Miami sun, he's still booking plenty of gigs in NYC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"No matter what happens, no one is going to take away his one thousand Vogue covers," says the staffer, adding that Garren just did the hair for the famous Karlie Kloss/Taylor Swift cover and is slated to be featured in W magazine's May issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There are clients that said, 'I would never see him again,' [but] who now hire him to cut their hair in their kitchens. They are just so happy to have him [doing house calls]."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As of press time, Garren had not responded to requests for comment.</td></tr>
