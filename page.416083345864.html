<h3>Nigeria, Egypt paired in Cup of Nations draw</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Nigerians and Egyptians are in Group G with Tanzania and Chad, and the Cameroonians and South Africans in Group M with Gambia and Mauritania.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Egypt have won the biennial Cup of Nations tournament a record seven times, Cameroon four times, Nigeria three times and South Africa once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Only the 13 group winners are guaranteed places at the January-February 2017 tournament in Gabon with just the best two runners-up also going through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Nigeria and Egypt are more accustomed to playing at the finals, but a dramatic fall from power by the Pharaohs meant they were only among the second seeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>After winning three consecutive titles in 2006, 2008 and 2010, Egypt failed to qualify for the next three tournaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Arab Spring political upheaval in Egypt and related security problems severely affected domestic football with many matches cancelled and other fixtures played held in spectator-less stadiums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Retirements of stars like midfielders Mohamed Abou Trika and Mohamed Barakat and defender Wael Gomaa and the ageing of goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary also diluted the power of the Pharaohs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The countries last clashed competitively at the 2010 Cup of Nations with Egypt winning a group game 3-1 in Angola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>South Africa were also second seeds, and are a far lesser force than in 1996 when they trounced Cameroon 3-0 in the opening match en route to conquering Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Defending champions Ivory Coast face Sudan and Sierra Leone in Group I, which also includes Gabon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>However, matches against automatic qualifiers Gabon count as friendlies with no points awarded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ivory Coast lifted a trophy that symbolises African national-team supremacy for the second time two months ago by edging Ghana 9-8 in a penalty shootout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The all-west Africa final in Equatorial Guinea city Bata had ended goalless after extra time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ghana, who won the last of four Cup of Nations titles 33 years ago, are in Group H with Mozambique, Rwanda and Mauritius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Morocco were originally barred from the 2017 qualifiers after refusing to host the tournament this year because they feared supporters could bring the deadly Ebola virus into the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But the north African kingdom successfully appealed against the ban to the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Tunisia were another country whose participation was in doubt after accusing African governing body CAF of bias following a controversial 2015 Cup of Nations quarter-finals loss to hosts Equatorial Guinea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>They eventually apologised to CAF president Issa Hayatou and are in Group A with Togo, Liberia and Djibouti.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Zambia, shock winners of the 2012 title when co-hosts Gabon staged the final in Libreville, face Congo Brazzaville, Kenya and Guinea Bissau in Group E.</td></tr>
