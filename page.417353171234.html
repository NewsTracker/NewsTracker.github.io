<h3>Volcano Erupts on Southern Japanese Island</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A volcano erupted on a small island in southern Japan on Friday, spewing black clouds of ash and rock towering into the sky and prompting authorities to tell residents to evacuate the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>No injuries were reported after Mount Shindake erupted about 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) in spectacular fashion, sending dense pyroclastic flows of rock and hot gases seaward, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The agency raised the volcano alert level for Kuchinoerabu island, where Shindake is located, to five, the highest on its scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Shindake also erupted in August last year for the first time since 1980.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A military helicopter was sent to survey the island and assess damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo that the Coast Guard had dispatched a ship to help evacuate the residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nobuaki Hayashi, a local village chief, said about 120 of the island's 137 residents were gathered at a local evacuation facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"There was a really loud, 'dong' sound of an explosion, and then black smoke rose, darkening the sky," he told the national broadcaster NHK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It smelled of sulfur."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hayashi said a few people on the island were still unaccounted for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One person, who lives in an area that is generally off-limits, was to be evacuated by boat as he could not travel safely to the shelter by land.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The skies here are blue, but smoke is still rising to the west," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Kuchinoerabu is 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of the main southern island of Kyushu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A heavily forested, mountainous island bordered mostly by rocky cliffsides, it is a national park supported mainly by tourism and fishing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Footage from NHK showed the mountain shrouded in light gray ash as the clouds from the eruption cleared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Kuchinoerabu usually can be reached only by a once-a-day ferry from Yakushima island, 12 kilometers (about 7 miles) to the east, which has an airport and a population of more than 13,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Japan, which sits atop the Pacific "Ring of Fire," has dozens of volcanoes and is frequently jolted by earthquakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In March 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake rocked northeastern Japan, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 18,500 people and ravaged much of the northern Pacific coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Authorities recently closed part of a popular hot springs about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Tokyo because of fears Mount Hakone, which sits to the southeast of Mount Fuji, might erupt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The eruption last September of another volcano, Mount Ontake in central Japan, killed 57 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Setsuya Nakada, a professor at Tokyo University, told NHK that the eruption on Kuchinoerabu was stronger than Mount Ontake's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Since the 2011 disasters, "this sort of activity has continued," Nakada said, when asked if more eruptions were likely on the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Probably the eruptions will continue."</td></tr>
