<h3>Benjamin Netanyahu tells Europe's Jews Israel is home, Denmark rabbi says terror no reason to move</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Jerusalem: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has declared his government would encourage a "mass immigration" of Jews from Europe, reopening a contentious debate about Israel's role, at a challenging time for European Jews and a month before Israel's national elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Speaking on Sunday, the morning after a Jewish guard was fatally shot outside a synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, in one of two attacks there, the remarks echoed a similar call by the prime minister inviting France's Jews to move to Israel after last month's attacks in Paris.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Critics said then that the expression of such sentiments so soon after the Paris shootings was insensitive and divisive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Jews have been murdered again on European soil only because they were Jews," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Of course, Jews deserve protection in every country, but we say to Jews, to our brothers and sisters: Israel is your home".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But expressing the unease felt by many Jews abroad over such comments, Jair Melchior, Denmark's chief rabbi, said he was "disappointed" by Mr Netanyahu's call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"People from Denmark move to Israel because they love Israel, because of Zionism, but not because of terrorism," Rabbi Melchior said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>. "If the way we deal with terror is to run somewhere else, we should all run to a deserted island."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>While some present Israel as primarily a refuge established in the aftermath of the Holocaust, many Israelis prefer to view Zionism as a more proactive realisation of the political vision of the Jewish nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Shlomo Avineri, an Israeli professor of political science, described Mr Netanyahu's call as "an intellectual and moral mistake" and accused him of taking a populist stance for electoral purposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Elections are scheduled for March 17.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The legitimacy of Israel does not hinge on anti-Semitism," said Dr Avineri, the author of a recent book, Herzl's Vision, a biography of Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It hinges on the right of the Jewish people to self-determination in the Jewish state."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>For some Israeli experts, though, Mr Netanyahu's call was a natural expression of the nation's ethos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In my view, Netanyahu is encouraging those who in any event intend to leave their countries of origin to move to Israel and not to other places," said Avinoam Bar-Yosef, president of the Jewish People Policy Institute, a research centre in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Even if it is controversial, this is something that a prime minister of Israel needs to do."</td></tr>
