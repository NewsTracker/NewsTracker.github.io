<h3>Tikrit hit by US air strikes on Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baghdad: US warplanes have begun air strikes against Islamic State positions in Tikrit, for the first time joining a struggling Iraqi offensive to retake the city after spending more than three weeks on the sidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A coalition of Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces aided by Iranian military advisers have been trying to root out Islamic State fighters from Tikrit, an important city north of Baghdad in Iraq's Sunni heartland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>From the start, the offensive went without US air assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A Shiite fighter from Saraya al-Salama heading to Tikrit last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Government and militia officials had boasted that air strikes were neither needed nor wanted, and US officials privately expressed discomfort with the idea of directly aiding an operation led by militias and Iranian officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>However, in recent days, as the militants have continued to hold out in central areas of the city, Iraqi military officials have said that air strikes would be needed to fully secure Tikrit, despite rebukes by Shiite militia commanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Control of Tikrit would give the Iraqi ground force command of a vital cluster of road networks and would be the first major success in rolling back a lightning offensive by the Islamic State last northern summer that brought the militants just a short drive away from Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Members of an Iraqi Shiite militant group called Imam Ali Brigades launch rockets against the Islamic State in Tikrit on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Surveillance flights by coalition aircraft over Tikrit began late on Tuesday, said a spokesman for the Iraqi military's Salahuddin Operations Command, which has responsibility for the military side of the Tikrit operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>And witnesses reported late on Wednesday that heavy bombing runs had begun in the city against the Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In Washington, the Pentagon confirmed on Wednesday night that air strikes had begun in Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Iraqi President Fuad Masum on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, in a speech broadcast on Iraqi state TV from an undisclosed location in Salahuddin province on Wednesday night, hailed the strikes, saying: "The time of freedom has just been started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We announce today what we have promised you yesterday, that we are going to liberate and clear each spot of our territory, and ISIS (Islamic State) won't have a foothold on Iraq's land."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Earlier on Wednesday, Khalid Shwani, the spokesman for President Fuad Masum, said Iraqi and US officials had formed a committee of senior advisers to decide whether air strikes would be beneficial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"President Masum is expecting that the Americans will conduct air strikes in Tikrit," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Until Wednesday, US air strikes had continued in other parts of Iraq, but not near Tikrit, which is on the main highway between Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and a stronghold of the Islamic State since June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>US officials have said that was mostly because Iraqi officials had not yet asked for air strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However, they also acknowledged concerns about Iran's unusually high-profile involvement in the Tikrit fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Qassem Suleimani, has been photographed and videotaped around the Tikrit front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Iraqi leaders have also publicly praised the Iranians for their assistance and some contrasted it with the lack of US assistance on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Even as some Iraqi security officials began worrying about the absence of air strikes, Hadi al-Ameri, the prominent leader of the group of Shiite militias known in Iraq as popular mobilisation committees, criticised any outreach towards the US.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Some of the weaklings in the army say that we need the Americans, but we say we do not need the Americans," Mr Ameri said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The preponderance of the 30,000 fighters on the Iraqi side have been members of the militias, fighting alongside Iraqi soldiers and policemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Iraqi government has tried to broaden the offensive to include more Sunnis but the force remains largely Shiite.</td></tr>
