<h3>CANNES WATCH: Karlie Kloss stuns, Andie MacDowell reveals</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Model Karlie Kloss poses for photographers upon arrival for the amfAR Cinema Against AIDS benefit at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, during the 68th Cannes international film festival, Cap d'Antibes, southern France, Thursday, May 21, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Day Nine at the Cannes Film Festival showed off model Karlie Kloss' figure in a slinky little Tom Ford number, while actress Andie MacDowell revealed why she never showed up at Cannes in 1989 with her hit film "Sex, Lies and Videotape."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And a film honoring designer Oscar de la Renta showed that he may be gone, but his influence at Cannes is still strong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Model Karlie Kloss gave celebrity guests at the amfAR annual charity gala more than a run for their money in the style stakes, wearing a slinky diamante-encrusted halter neck cocktail gown with sensually large arm holes by Tom Ford.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 6-foot former ballerina towered above the petite actress Eva Longoria as they posed for cameras together, before gracefully greeting her dress creator Ford, who looked dapper in a tux.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kloss has been consistently dazzling during the Cannes Film Festival since it began last week, including a standout Oscar de la Renta powder blue embellished mermaid gown at the glitzy de Grisogono party earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Both that event and the amfAR gala were held at the picturesque Hotel du Cap-Eden Roc in Cap d'Antibes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The spirit of Oscar de la Renta lives on every day at the Cannes Film Festival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Though the Dominican Republic-born fashion designer passed away last year aged 82 after battling cancer, his landmark fashion designs continue to dominate the red carpet - from Emma Stone's black sheer tulle gown at the "The Irrational Man" photocall to Aishwarya Rai's maroon silk number and Karlie Kloss' incredible blue fishtail gown at the De Grisogono soiree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Now a documentary film has been screened at Cannes, called "Ovation for Oscar," paying homage to his work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Featuring US Vogue Editor Anna Wintour and his widow, Annette de la Renta, the 20-minute film, directed by Ryan Curtis, is a behind-the-scenes look at the first posthumous exhibit of the designer's work at the SCAD college of art and design, with which the late designer was closely involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"When Oscar de la Renta passed there was an outpouring of love," said Curtis, adding that he relished the chance to pay homage to the designer via the prism of the college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The film shows the creation of the exhibit through the eyes of a bright-eyed young student, who looks in wonder at the myriad designs - including Hillary Clinton's famous red dress that graced the cover of Vogue in 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Each dress that he created, the film notes, captures the unique essence of each woman it was tailored for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"He's one of the last old masters. He loved each individual woman, and that's his genius," Curtis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Andie MacDowell has great memories of the Cannes Film Festival, but also one big regret - the year she decided to skip it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"You know 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' won here and I didn't come because I had just had my daughter, and I was nursing her and really round and I was afraid people would make fun of me," she said of the 1989 film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I know that was stupid. Now in hindsight, because I've matured and I'm older, I don't really care what people say," the 57-year-old actress added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That daughter she was nursing is Rainey Qualley, a singer-songwriter and actress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She was recently seen in the last season of "Mad Men."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>MacDowell's other daughter, Margaret, is also an actress, starring in the HBO series "The Leftovers."</td></tr>
