<h3>Clinton agrees to testify on Benghazi, emails this month</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) " Hillary Rodham Clinton is willing to testify on Capitol Hill later this month about the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and about her email practices, her attorney told lawmakers in a letter Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Former top U.S. diplomat Clinton, who is front-runner to win the Democratic presidential nomination, has faced sustained scrutiny over the September 2012 militant attacks that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans at the U.S. outpost in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Her lawyer David Kendall said Clinton would testify only for one session the week of May 18 or later, not twice as requested by Republican Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Trey Gowdy, chairman of the special panel investigating the Benghazi attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Gowdy had requested one hearing to focus on Clinton's use of private emails, and a separate session on Benghazi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kendall said that Clinton would answer all lawmakers' questions during one session and it would not be necessary for her to appear twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He wrote there was "no basis, logic or precedent for such an unusual request."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Top Democrat on the panel, Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Elijah Cummings, released Kendall's letter along with a statement saying the lawyer's offer should more than satisfy the Republican demands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Chairman Gowdy should take 'yes' for an answer and finally schedule the hearing," Cummings wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Dragging out this process further into the presidential election season sacrifices any chance that the American people will see it as serious or legitimate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Spokesman Jamal Ware said Gowdy will issue a statement later "regarding the path forward" for Clinton's testimony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ware said the committee "has consistently shown it is interested in getting the facts and doing so in a deliberate and diligent manner."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He said it was a result of the panel's efforts, "the American people now know about Secretary Clinton's unusual email arrangement with herself."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Clinton previously testified on Capitol Hill over the attacks in January 2013, when she was still secretary of state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Republicans say they have more questions, especially in light of the revelations that she used a private email account while secretary of state and decided which emails to retain and which to turn over to the government.</td></tr>
