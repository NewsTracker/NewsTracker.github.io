<h3>Somali militants threaten more bloody attacks against Kenya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somali militants on Saturday threatened to stage more bloody attacks on Kenya after the group's fighters killed nearly 150 people during an assault on a Kenyan university on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Four masked al Shabaab gunmen went on a killing spree in a pre-dawn raid, hunting down and executing students in a college campus in Garissa, a northeastern town about 200km (120 miles) from the Somali border.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The al Qaeda aligned group said the attack was retribution for Kenya's presence in Somalia and mistreatment of Muslims within Kenya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath from occurring in your cities," the group said in an emailed statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the message, directed at the Kenyan public, the group vowed a long and gruesome war, saying Kenya's cities will "run red with blood".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The death toll in the attack on the Garissa University College has risen to 148, Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said late on Friday, adding that police were interviewing five suspects after making three additional arrests on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The raid on Thursday was the biggest attack on Kenya since 1998, when al Qaeda bombed the U.S. embassy in the capital Nairobi and killed more than 200 people.</td></tr>
