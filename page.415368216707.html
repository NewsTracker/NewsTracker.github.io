<h3>Ferguson Manager Is 5th out After DOJ Report Alleging Bias</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - In this March 4, 2015, file photo, protesters block traffic on the street outside the Ferguson, Mo., police department in Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Justice Department on Wednesday cleared a white former Ferguson police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old, but also issued a scathing report calling for sweeping changes in city law enforcement practices it called discriminatory and unconstitutional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The police chief in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson resigned Wednesday in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report prompted by the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Calling Chief Thomas Jackson an "honorable man," Mayor James Knowles III announced the city had reached a mutual separation agreement that will pay Jackson one year of his nearly $96,000 annual salary and health coverage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jackson's resignation becomes effective March 19, at which point Lt. Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Al Eickhoff will become acting chief while the city searches for a replacement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jackson had previously resisted calls by protesters and some of Missouri's top elected leaders to step down over his handling of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown and the weeks of sometimes-violent protests that followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He was widely criticized from the outset, both for an aggressive police response to protesters and for his agency's erratic and infrequent releases of key information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He took nearly a week to publicly identify Officer Darren Wilson as the shooter and then further heightened tension in the community by releasing Wilson's name at the same time as store security video that police said showed Brown stealing a box of cigars and shoving a clerk only a short time before his death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Jackson submitted a four-sentence letter in which he said he was announcing his resignation with profound sadness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he felt it was time for the city to move on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I believe this is the appropriate thing to do at this time," Jackson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This city needs to move forward without any distractions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>During a 12-minute news conference, Knowles said Jackson resigned after "a lot of soul-searching" about how the community could heal from the racial unrest stemming from the fatal shooting last summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The chief is the kind of honorable man you don't have to go to," Knowles said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"He comes to you when he knows that this is something we have to seriously discuss."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Jackson becomes the sixth employee to resign or be fired after the U.S. Department of Justice last week issued the report that cleared Wilson of civil rights charges in the shooting but found a profit-driven court system and widespread racial bias in the city police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division released a statement saying the U.S. government remains committed to reaching a "court-enforceable agreement" to address Ferguson's "unconstitutional practices," regardless of who's in charge of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A U.S. law enforcement official said Wednesday the Justice Department had not pressured or encouraged Jackson to resign during meetings with him but had also not resisted the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing meetings between the Justice Department and the police department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The resignation was welcomed by state lawmakers who represent Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"There would be a lot of people that would approve of that," said Democratic state Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sharon Pace, who represents the neighborhood where Brown was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Jackson oversaw the Ferguson force for nearly five years before the shooting that stirred months of unrest across the St. Louis region and drew global attention to the predominantly black city of 21,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill were among those working behind the scenes to get him to resign, but Jackson stood firm.</td></tr>
