<tr><td>12</td><td>Police near the Copenhagen synagogue where a person was shot dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Police spokesman Allan Teddy Wadsworth-Hansen said of the synagogue attack: "It started with police being down at the site. A person comes up and starts to shoot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The two police who were there were hit, one in the arm and one in the leg. They are both currently receiving treatment. Their lives are not in danger," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He declined to say if there was any link between the dead man and the synagogue, which is just metres away from where the shooting took place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Parts of the Danish capital had been cordoned off but "it's not a question of a general curfew. People are allowed to travel around Copenhagen, safely," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The nearby Noerreport train and metro station, one of the country's busiest, had been evacuated and trains were not stopping there, Danish news agency Ritzau reported, quoting train operator DSB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We cannot say anything about the condition of the injured yet," Copenhagen police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"The perpetrator fled on foot," they said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The news followed a shooting attack at the cafe at the Krudttonden cultural centre earlier on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The cafe was hosting a debate on freedom of speech, which was attended by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has been threatened with death for his cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked worldwide protests in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The two shootings come just weeks after a series of bloody Islamist attacks in Paris that left 17 people dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Police said a manhunt was under way for the gunman who targeted the talk and who had fled after exchanging fire with officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>They released a photo of the suspect, a man in a dark anorak and a maroon hat carrying a black bag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Swedish security services said they were on alert for any attempt by the suspect to cross the bridge from Denmark to Sweden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt described the assault as "a terrorist attack", while the United States branded it "deplorable".</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The windows of the cultural centre were pock-marked by multiple bullet holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>French ambassador to Denmark Francois Zimeray, who had been present at the debate but was not hurt, said the shooting was an attempt to replicate the January 7 attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris, which killed 12 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"They shot from the outside [and] had the same intention as Charlie Hebdo, only they didn't manage to get in," he said by telephone from the venue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"Intuitively I would say there were at least 50 gunshots, and the police here are saying 200," he told AFP.</td></tr>

<tr><td>36</td><td>After witness statements indicated there was just one attacker, police later said they were hunting for a lone gunman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Media reports said it was likely the gunman used an automatic rifle to fire as many rounds as possible in a short time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Denmark has today been hit by a cynical act of violence. Everything leads us to believe that the shooting was a political attack and therefore a terrorist act," the Danish Prime Minister said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The shootings come at a time of heightened security and rising fears of Islamist violence, after gunmen launched the worst attack in half a century on the streets of Paris last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Anti-terrorism sweeps carried out across Europe since mid-January have resulted in the arrests of dozens of suspected jihadists and seizures of large stocks of weapons and explosives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Isreali Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday urged a mass exodus of Jews from Europe in the wake of the Copenhagen attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"Jews deserve protection in every country, but we say to Jews, to our brothers and sisters: Israel is your home," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"We are preparing and calling for the absorption of mass immigration from Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Mr Netanyahu made similar statements about immigration after the Paris shooting, saying Israel would welcome European Jews who chose to emigrate for safety reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>He has already asked the cabinet to back a multi-million dollar plan to absorb new immigrants from France and Belgium, where safety concerns rose after attacks on Jewish targets by Islamist militants, and from war-ravaged Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>After the shooting in Denmark, Moshe Kantor, the leader of the Brussels-based European Jewish Congress, said European governments weren't doing enough to protect their Jewish communities against militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>The attack "demonstrates that defensive measures to protect the public, and the Jewish community in particular, are not enough," Mr Kantor told Bloomberg by email.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"The authorities must change the paradigm and take the battle to the radical Islamist enclaves, prevent the next attack and bring the terrorists and their supporters to task."</td></tr>

<h3>Both sides claim violations after Ukraine cease-fire starts</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But within two hours of the cease-fire's scheduled start, the warring sides were already trading accusations of fresh attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>International attention will be focused in the coming days on the strategic railway hub of Debaltseve, where Ukrainian government forces have for weeks been fending off severe onslaughts from pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The U.S. State Department said images from eastern Ukraine offer "credible pieces of evidence" that the Russian military has deployed larger amounts of artillery and multiple rocket launchers around Debaltseve to shell Ukrainian forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We are confident that these are Russian military, not separatist systems," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko issued a cease-fire order in a live broadcast for all the country's armed forces to hold their fire from one minute after midnight Kiev time (2201 GMT, 5:01 p.m. EST).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Accusations of violations were quick to follow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ukrainian security services chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said one infringement was reported about 50 minutes after the deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Artillery salvoes were fired from an area that Nalyvaichenko said is under the control of a Cossack unit manned by Russian citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Meanwhile, rebels accused the Ukrainians of deploying artillery shortly after midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Donetsk News Agency, a separatist mouthpiece, cited senior rebel defense official Eduard Basurin as saying the Ukrainian forces garrisoned in Debaltseve fired artillery and mortars at rebel positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"In the interests of preventing the death of the civilian population, precise fire is being deployed toward the enemy's positions," Basurin was cited as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The hours before the cease-fire were marked by ferocious battles around Debaltseve, as Ukrainian armed forces undertook desperate attempts to gain control over a highway linking the town to their rearguard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Speaking to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov by telephone Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed concern about what he called efforts by Russia and the separatists to cut off Debaltseve in advance of the cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Separatist fighters insist they have fully encircled Debaltseve, which they say allows them to claim the territory as theirs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But Poroshenko said in his televised address that the road to the town remains open and that Ukrainian troops there had been resupplied with ammunition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An undated satellite image issued by the Ukrainian government showed a three-mile-long cloud of black smoke hovering above Debaltseve, evidence of what it said was the scale of rebel shelling in the hours before the scheduled start of the cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Entire swathes of the war-stricken regions of Donetsk and Luhansk were caught up in artillery duels over the weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Officials in the key government-held port city of Mariupol reported an array of rocket attacks hitting areas near the city Saturday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mariupol is on the Azov Sea and concerns are strong that the Russian-backed separatists aim to seize it to create a land corridor that runs between mainland Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed 11 months ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Towns distant from the front line were not spared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Projectiles rained down Saturday afternoon on the government-held town of Artemivsk, 25 miles north of Debaltseve, striking a school, which rapidly burned to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Russia has repeatedly denied Western claims that it has sent troops and equipment to aid the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But on Saturday, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, posted on Twitter what he said were satellite photos showing Russian artillery systems near the town of Lomuvatka, 12 miles northeast of Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The images could not immediately be verified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In a telephone call with Poroshenko hours before the start of the cease-fire period, President Barack Obama expressed his "deep concern about the ongoing violence, particularly in and around Debaltseve."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The White House said in a statement that the two leaders "emphasized the pressing need" for all parties to implement the cease-fire and agreed to remain in contact in the coming days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Obama also spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel who took a lead role in negotiating the cease-fire agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The deal was hammered out in a marathon talks this week between Merkel and her counterparts from Ukraine, Russia and France in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said failure to maintain the peace would cost the region and the people of eastern Ukraine "a high price."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"If we miss this opportunity, the chance to defuse the serious conflict in eastern Ukraine by way of negotiations will be gone for a long time," Steinmeier said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Speaking in Kiev on Saturday afternoon, Poroshenko said his government would take urgent measures if the Minsk agreement collapsed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"If there is no peace, we may have to take the decision to impose martial law," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"In this event, martial law will be imposed not only in the Donetsk and Luhansk (regions), but across the whole country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Cessation of hostilities is only the first in a series of planned steps agreed to in Minsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Withdrawals of heavy weaponry from the front line, creating a zone roughly 30-85 miles wide, depending on the caliber of the weapons, are to begin Monday and be completed in two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>No provisions are envisioned for the withdrawal of troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The peace plan also requires the Ukrainian government to resume paying pensions and state benefits to citizens in rebel-held territory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Ukraine's financial blockade against the rebels has led to a catastrophic collapse in living standards in eastern Ukraine, depriving the poorest of any immediate means of support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The fighting started in April after armed pro-Russian separatists took control of towns and official buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The seizures began after Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych was driven from power in the wake of months of protests in the capital, Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The separatists claim the new Ukrainian authorities are fascist-inspired and aim to suppress the heavily ethnic Russian population in the east.</td></tr>
