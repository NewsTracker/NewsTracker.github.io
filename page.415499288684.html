<h3>British hostage John Cantlie 'water boarded for weeks' after trying to escape IS TWICE</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Spanish journalist Javier Espinosa, who was previously freed by the jihadists, has revealed how Mr Cantlie, 44, tried to escape twice with American journalist James Foley, 40.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr Cantlie, a war photographer, is still being held by the Islamic State while Mr Foley - who was kidnapped alongside Mr Cantlie in Syria in November 2012 - was beheaded by his captors in August last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Espinosa, who works for newspaper El Mundo, is one of the few Western hostages to survive the clutches of Islamic State, otherwise known as ISIS or ISIL, and was let go in 2014 after the Spanish government brokered a deal with the extremists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Writing in The Times, he said: "Foley and Cantlie tried [to escape] twice. The first was a failure before it started. They were caught trying to get off their handcuffs with a skeleton key they made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"On the second occasion, the American showed his true humanity. After getting out of the room where the prisoners were, he had to wait for Cantlie who was to escape second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The guard saw that Cantlie [had freed himself] and Foley could have tried to escape on his own, but he gave himself up. 'I couldn't leave John on his own,' Foley said."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Both journalists then endured weeks of punishment including beatings and waterboarding - a torture technique that involves covering the mouth with a water-soaked towel until the victim almost drowns - said Mr Espinosa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They were literally trying to kill us for weeks until they realised that we had given up trying to escape," Mr Cantlie told Mr Espinosa, according to his account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His revelation comes the day after he told how Jihadi John, revealed as Brit Mohammed Emwazi, threatened to cut his throat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Spaniard also revealed how two other hostages failed to escape, French journalist Nicolas Henin, 40, released in April 2014, and Danish photojournalist Daniel Rye, 25, released in June 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr Rye, also a gymnastics champion, used his strength and elasticity to squeeze through an open window.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He told Mr Espinosa: "I was running barefoot and those Syrians I saw, instead of helping me, alerted the kidnappers. I tried to hide in a cornfield but they shot at me. The bullet whistled pass."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Dane was then left hanging from a ceiling for days, suspended by handcuffs that cut his wrists while his ankles were bound with irons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Espinosa told how hostages were left for days without food and water and then given bread and dates or four olives, which gave them diarrhoea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said the captors "did not care about the nationality or occupations of their detainees, except when they were being tortured" and had more contempt for journalists than other hostages such as British aid worker David Haines - although he was given so many blows he suffered from permanent diarrhoea so refused the food he was given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Islamic State captors also had a big problem with the hostages' smell, telling them "you smell like pigs", to which Mr Espinosa thought: "Of course, we haven't showered for three months."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Because of their stench the captives were left in a freezing cell in winter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The hostages were split up at different stages but were eventually put together again where they had 'conferences' led by Mr Foley to keep them busy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They asked new British hostage and taxi driver Alan Henning, 47, about news from the outside world and he told them about Nelson Mandela's death and how football teams were doing - talking about anything but their own situations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mr Henning was beheaded in October 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr Cantlie last appeared in an Islamic State propaganda video last month and days later was reported to have told his family in the terror group's Dabiq magazine, to "let him go and get on with their lives".</td></tr>

<h3>Boehner Expected to Announce Investigation Into Clinton Emails</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>During a news conference last week, Clinton did not go into the details of how the review of her email was conducted, but said it was "thorough" and that she went "above and beyond" what she was required to do in turning over many of her emails to the State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails and deliver them to the State Department," she said, adding that all other emails were personal and pertained to matters such as "yoga routines," "family vacations," and "planning Chelsea's wedding."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After the news conference, Clinton's team distributed a lengthy question-and-answer document that detailed the "multi-step" process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The process appeared to have included an extensive, nuanced search of Clinton's inbox, but the document did not make clear how many of the emails were opened and read in the review.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Sunday, Clinton's spokesman clarified that "every email was read" and that the steps they outlined in the document "were in addition to reading them all, not in lieu of reading them all."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The results of the search were that Clinton's attorneys found 30,490 work-related emails and 31,830 emails that were deemed "private and personal."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton said on Tuesday she deleted all of the personal emails because she felt she "had no reason to save them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The revelation has only raised more questions among Clinton's detractors about what was in those emails and why she used the private account in the first place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clinton said she did so out of "convenience," but acknowledged during the news conference it "would have been better" if she had used two separate phones and two email accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Democratic strategist and Clinton ally James Carville, speaking on "This Week," said he suspected the former First Lady "didn't want [Rep.] Louis Gohmert rifling through her e-mails," and added the controversy "amounts to nothing but a bunch of people flapping their jaws about nothing."</td></tr>
