<h3>Cyclone Nathan crossing Qld coast</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The cyclone made landfall between Cape Melville and Cape Flattery at about 4am (AEST).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The very destructive core of the cyclone, which is packing wind gusts of up to 230km/h, is moving slightly further north than what was expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Less powerful but still destructive winds, with gusts to 150 km/h, are currently affecting coastal and island areas between Cape Melville and Cooktown, and will extend to adjacent inland areas later on Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gales with gusts up to 120km/h are being experienced 130km out from the centre of the cyclone in coastal areas between Coen and Cape Tribulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>These winds will extend to inland areas including Laura and Palmerville, and north to Lockhart River, later on Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Cook Shire, which takes in Cooktown, just south of Cape Flattery, has tweeted that water services are cut but the power seems to be holding out in the town.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Earlier Mayor Peter Scott said the town had done all it could to prepare, and that Ergon Energy had deployed generators to restore power if it went down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"We've got a lot of people on the ground that can support people now, or after the event," he told the ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A resident of Poison Creek, who lives west of Cooktown, said power had been cut there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We're really copping it now. It's really blowing and raining really hard at the moment," the man, identified only as Peter, told the ABC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>About 50 residents, including Rouel Saga and her two-year-old daughter, are riding out the savage storm in Cooktown's cyclone shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I'm a bit worried," the 34-year-old Saga told AAP late on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Last year (during Cyclone Ita in April) the whole place was shaking and it felt like it was going to blow down."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Poss Weingarth and husband Jeff, aged in their 70s, are also taking refuge in the shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>During Ita, which hit Cooktown as a category four storm, the couple's home was flooded and many of their belongings destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Beyond the threat posed by Nathan's powerful winds, coastal residents between Cape Melville and Cooktown are also on flood alert from a dangerous storm tide that could occur as the storm moves inland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Bureau of Meteorology has warned the sea is likely to rise steadily up to a level well above the normal tide, with damaging waves and flooding of some low-lying areas, which could also extend some way inland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding is also occurring in coastal and adjacent inland between Coen and Cape Tribulation, and will extend west across Cape York Peninsula with the passage of the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Queensland Fire and Emergency Services far north regional director Wayne Coutts says residents must remain indoors until they are advised by authorities that it's safe to go outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"There are likely to be a number of hazards, including fallen trees, power lines, debris and even possible structural damage to infrastructure, and it is vital people do not explore collapsed buildings or go sightseeing," he said.</td></tr>

<h3>Solar eclipse: how to watch the eclipse safely</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The hole does not have to be circular but should be no wider than 5mm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A larger hole will produce a brighter but fuzzier image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Prop up or clamp the mirror so that it reflects the sunlight onto a pale screen or wall, ideally through a window.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A projection distance of five metres (16.4 feet) will produce an image of the Sun just over 5cm across.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>&#x2022; When will the solar eclipse be at its best near you?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The eclipse can be seen in the image as the Moon starts to take a "bite" out of the Sun, appearing upside down compared with its position in the sky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>If clouds move across the face of the Sun, they can be seen as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The smaller the mirror and further away the wall, the sharper the image will be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Experiment with the distances and mirror size.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Do not look into the mirror during the eclipse as this is just as dangerous as looking directly at the Sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A big advantage of this method is that it allows a number of people to watch the eclipse at the same time - ideal for schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>&#x2022; How should I watch the solar eclipse?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Pinholes allow light through them and can create an image like a lens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Make a small hole in a piece of card using a compass or other sharp-pointed implement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Standing with your back to the Sun, position another white card behind the one with the pinhole so that the Sun projects an image onto it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An alternative method uses a cereal box or something similar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Make a pinhole in one edge, point it towards the Sun, and a tiny image will be seen projected onto the inside of the box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A piece of white paper or card placed inside will make it easier to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Never look through the pinhole at the Sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Cover one eyepiece of a pair of binoculars with a lens cap and face the "big" end of the binoculars towards the Sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The uncovered lens will project an image of the Sun that can be cast onto a plain card held about a foot away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Use the focus wheel to sharpen the image.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Ideally, the binoculars should be fastened to a tripod or stand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A cardboard "collar" with holes cut to fit the large lenses will shade the card on which the image is projected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A small telescope can be used the same way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Take an ordinary kitchen colander and stand with your back to the Sun holding it in one hand and a piece of paper in the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The holes in the colander can be used to project multiple eclipse images onto the paper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>These are the only way of viewing the eclipse directly, other than through a telescope fitted with a professional filter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Similar to 3D glasses, eclipse viewers are made from card and inlaid with a special material that cuts the Sun's light down 100,000 times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>If using a viewer, check for holes or scratches as it is only safe if undamaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Eclipse viewers are being given away free with the Society for Popular Astronomy's members' magazine and the BBC's Sky at Night magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>What is a solar eclipse?</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It might sound boring but the safest way to see the eclipse is to view it indirectly from the comfort of your home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Where is the best place to watch the solar eclipse?</td></tr>
