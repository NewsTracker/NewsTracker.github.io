<h3>Ukraine's fragile truce shattered in Debaltseve</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Luhanskoe: Shelling has resumed around the contested Ukrainian town of Debaltseve, shattering a delicate truce and jeopardising hopes of a diplomatic solution to the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Guns fell silent across swathes of the front line at midnight on Saturday after Ukrainian and pro-Russian separatist leaders issued public ceasefire orders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Both sides reported an appreciable decline in intensity of fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>French President Francois Hollande, who helped broker the ceasefire deal in Minsk, said it was "generally satisfactory" despite some "local incidents".</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukrainian army vehicles on the road between Artemivsk and Debaltseve in Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But fighting continued near the port city of Mariupol in Donetsk region and there were reports that two civilians were killed by rockets in the town of Popasna in Luhansk region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In Debaltseve, the town encircled by separatists and described by the Ukraine army as "the main hot spot", rebels warned that the truce "does not apply".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A resumption of fighting at key flashpoints on Sunday made it clear that diplomatic efforts had managed to slow, but not stop, the war in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A building damaged by shelling in Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Several thousand Ukrainian troops are believed to be holding out in the town, a key road and rail junction on the main road between Dontesk and Luhansk, the separatists' two biggest strongholds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said his forces would continue their offensive in Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We will cease fire with the exclusion of internal areas, that is to say Debaltseve," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"There is not a single word about Debaltseve in the Minsk agreement. Kiev has betrayed thousands of soldiers there."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ominously, he went on to warn that any Ukrainian attempt to break out of or relieve the pocket would be considered a violation of the agreement - laying the ground for a general unravelling of the entire peace deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Anatoliy Stelmakh, a Ukraine military spokesman, said the pro-Russian insurgents used "every kind of weapon, including Grad rockets" in Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The rebels tried to storm our positions three times," he said, stressing that the Ukrainian forces were "only responding to attacks".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Troops manning the last Ukrainian positions in the area said fighting had eased, but that the current respite was merely a lull, not the end of the war.</td></tr>
