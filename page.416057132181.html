<h3>HBO Now available ? now on Apple TV</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>We knew that HBO Now was coming to Apple TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tim Cook promised us as much at last month's Apple Watch event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>We also knew that it would arrive just before the season premiere of HBO's hit show, Game of Thrones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But what we're just finding out is that the app is now available for download on Apple TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Users of Apple's set-top streaming box can commit to a cable-free HBO subscription for $14.99 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>What they'll get with the membership is access to a huge backlog of movies and classic TV shows like The Wire and The Sopranos, as well as new favorites like Veep and True Detective.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>What's more is that new subscribers will get the first month free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This is perfect if you just want a taste of the next season of Game of Thrones when it premieres April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>(But how could you stop at just a taste?)</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>HBO's cable-free streaming app has landed on the iOS App Store, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>By the end of the day (as of this writing), HBO Now should be available on your iPhone and iPad as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>And if you're using a Mac, you can access the service through the HBO Now website to boot.</td></tr>
