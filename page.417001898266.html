<h3>Cannes slips into high gear with Mad Max screening</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Cannes Film Festival slipped into high gear on its second day by screening the new Mad Max blockbuster and starting the competition for its Palme d'Or.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mad Max: Fury Road, a sci-fi road battle movie starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, gave a jolt of glamour to the Riviera event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The movie has already received good reviews for its stunts and action sequences.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>[Mad Max] is like watching the Cirque du Soleil at some Led Zeppelin fetish club.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Theron rankled at questions suggesting she was playing as tough as the men in the movie, saying that women are capable of just as much resourcefulness as men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hardy, who plays second fiddle to Theron's character, told reporters the movie was "relentless and incredibly visceral".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It's like watching the Cirque du Soleil at some Led Zeppelin fetish club," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Director George Miller said Hardy had the same level of charisma as Mel Gibson, who shot to fame after playing Mad Max in the original 1979 movie and two sequels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He also demurred when asked if further Mad Max films were in the pipeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Day two saw the first two of the 19 films in competition unspooled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Our Little Sister was a gentle Japanese family drama adapted from a manga, which tells the story of three siblings who meet their orphaned teenage half-sister for the first time at their father's funeral and invite her to live with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Director Hirokazu Koreeda said he got so swept up reading the original manga he had to buy the movie rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I said to myself, 'I know someone else is going to make a film out of it'. And so I thought, I would prefer it be me and no one but me," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The second competition entry was Tale of Tales, an Italian-directed movie shot in English, with an international cast including Salma Hayek and Vincent Cassel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Critics gave warm reviews to the fantasy film, which brought together three fairytales inspired by 17th century poet Giambattista Basile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The key to the film is desire which becomes obsession and creates conflicts," director Matteo Garrone said.</td></tr>
