<h3>Shot Ferguson police officers released from US hospital</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ferguson: Two police officers who were shot in Ferguson were victims of "an ambush", the St Louis County police chief said on Thursday, hours after gunfire rang out in front of the police station, throwing into panic what had been a largely peaceful protest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Demonstrators and police officers alike hit the ground when the shots echoed through the crisp air shortly after midnight, striking the two officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Many people ran for cover, and police officers clad in riot gear dragged their wounded comrades to safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Other officers crouched behind cars and walls, drawing their handguns or rifles as they rapidly surveyed their surroundings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Protestors demonstrate outside the Ferguson Police Department on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The injured officers were released from the hospital hours later, on Thursday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We're lucky by God's grace we didn't lose two officers last night", Chief Jon Belmar of the St Louis County Police Department said at a midmorning news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was clear that the police were the targets, he said, adding, "This is really an ambush, is what it is".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Echoing Mr Belmar's comments, US Attorney-General Eric Holder called the shootings "heinous and cowardly attacks".</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Police mobilise in the parking lot of the Ferguson Police Station after two police officers were shot on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson," Mr Holder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"This was a damn punk, a punk, who was trying to sow discord."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>President Barack Obama weighed in on Twitter, writing: "Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Later in the morning, in an action that officials said was part of the investigation into the shooting, police SWAT units surrounded a house a few blocks from the shooting scene, and officers climbed onto the roof and broke through a vent there to gain access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Police take cover after two officers were shot while standing guard in front of the Ferguson Police Station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"People have been taken in for questioning," said a police spokesman, Sergeant Brian Schellman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"No arrests at this point."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Mr Belmar said people had a right to protest peacefully, but also said "there is an unfortunate association with that gathering" and the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"I feel confident that for whatever reason they were observers, whatever you want to call it, with the group of individuals that were down there protesting," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"This is no reflection, again, on any of those guys; they can't help it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Witnesses among the demonstrators denied any link to the shootings, saying that they believed the shots originated from the top of a hill about 220 metres directly across from the station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Belmar did not specify a location but estimated the distance at 125 metres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Police shine a light on a helmet as they investigate the scene where two police officers were shot outside the Ferguson Police Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"There's just no way anybody I know did that," said Bob Hudgins, a protester who is running for city council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"This was completely out of the blue, and they were not attached or embedded" with the demonstration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The shooting threatened to ratchet up tensions and undo efforts to change the way Ferguson police do business and to heal the anger and frustration that have boiled over since August 9, when a white police officer, Darren Wilson, fatally shot an unarmed 18-year-old black man, Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The Brown family, in a statement from its lawyer, denounced "the actions of stand-alone agitators" who tried to derail the protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"It cannot and will not be tolerated."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The city of Ferguson said in a statement that it was "diligently working to make systematic changes necessary to instil confidence," but added, "we cannot continue to move forward under threats of violence and destruction".</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In his comments, Mr Holder said that Ferguson officials had made some progress in addressing the city's problems but that significant work remained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He announced an program intended to help reduce racial bias and improve relations between police and the residents, part of an initiative started in the aftermath of the Brown shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The house that police raided is the home of Iresha Turner, 22, and her six-year-old son, according to Ms Turner's grandmother, Iris Turner, 59.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>She said her granddaughter and a male friend had been taken in for questioning by the police, but she insisted that Iresha Turner would not have had anything to do with the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Iresha Turner and her son were at the protests the night before, the elder Ms Turner said, but they fled when shots were fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>She said her granddaughter dropped a friend off, then returned home and found the police already there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The shooting came just hours after the Ferguson police chief, Thomas Jackson, announced that he would resign, a move greeted with praise from protesters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Ever since the shooting of Brown, Mr Jackson had been at the centre of criticism that he ran a racially biased and abusive department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Last week, the US Justice Department released an investigation report that accused the city of racially biased and unconstitutional practices in law enforcement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Since then, in addition to Mr Jackson, the city manager, the municipal judge, and two police commanders have said they were leaving their jobs, and the court's chief clerk was fired - changes that city officials had hoped would persuade residents that they were prepared to start anew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>The officers who were shot on Thursday were standing side by side, part of a cordon from multiple police departments, keeping protesters away from the police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>There had been as many as 69 officers in the evening, dwindling to about 49 at the time of the shooting, Mr Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Mr Belmar said the shooting realised his worst fears over the months of unrest since Brown's killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"When you look at the tenor of at least some of the people involved in the protest or civil unrest, it can be troubling," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"I think it's a miracle that we haven't had any instances similar to this over the summer and fall."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>He drew a parallel to the fatal shooting in December of two New York City police officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, by a man who said he was enraged by killings by the police, including that of Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"We were very close to having happen what happened to NYPD," Mr Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>He said officers had seen muzzle flashes, and later found shell casings that may have been from the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Based on the sound of the shots and the officers' wounds, he said, the weapon was a handgun, not a rifle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The Webster Groves officer who was shot is 32 years old and a seven-year veteran of the force, while the St Louis County officer is 41 and has 14 years' experience, the county police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Both were treated at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The younger officer was shot in the cheekbone, just below his right eye, and the bullet lodged behind his right ear, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>A bullet struck the other officer in the right shoulder, and exited his back on the right side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>No officers returned fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Emotions quickly ran high after the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>One Ferguson officer, standing among the protesters as things calmed down, said: "This is what they wanted to happen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>When a protester told him that no one wanted this to happen, the officer was adamant, saying that was his opinion and that the protester could differ if he wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Protesters on the scene were quick to point out that the gunfire had not come from among them, rather from a distance behind them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Kim Tihen, a Ferguson City Council member and former Ferguson police officer, released a statement saying: "While I have always been supportive of the peaceful protesters who have simply wanted their message heard, I am beyond outraged by the behaviour and lawlessness of the protesters who want nothing more than to destroy our city."</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Earlier in the night, the protests took on a familiar pattern that had not been seen here since after a grand jury announced in November that it would not indict Wilson for the fatal shooting of Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>It was as much a celebration of Mr Jackson's resignation as it was a call for more action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>"Not just Jackson, we want Knowles, Ferguson has got to go!" they yelled in reference to James Knowles III, the mayor of Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Protesters engaged in a cat-and-mouse game of sorts with the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Dozens of them flooded into the street in front of the Police Department, blocking cars as they tried to pass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Things occasionally became tense between the protesters and motorists, some of whom refused to back away when demonstrators lined up in front of their vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>On several occasions, drivers inched forward, tapping the knees of protesters who dared them to hit them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>Each time, one side would eventually give in: either the driver would back away, or the protesters would let them through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>But on other occasions, police officers wearing helmets and clutching transparent shields and batons would race into the street to clear away the demonstrators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>The police made a handful of arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Some of the tensest moments came when the protesters fought among themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Some people urged others to block cars, while others urged their fellow demonstrators to get out of the street and direct their anger at the officers in front of the police station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>There were tussles between protesters who did not recognise one another, with the fault line appearing to be those who had been demonstrating for many months versus those who were new to the movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Some took offence to the supposedly new protesters trying to tell them what to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>At one point, fist fights broke out in the street as the police stood by watching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>The protesters stood on the east side of South Florissant Road, while the police held their line on the west side, in front of the station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Then, without any warning or seeming escalation, the shots rang out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>"I heard the bullets go past my head," said Bradley Rayford, a freelance photographer, who said he was standing near the officers when the shots were fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>After the first one, Mr Rayford said, he looked up at a hill across from the police station and saw muzzle fire from that direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>He said he heard about four shots, after which he moved to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>After the shots were fired on Thursday, the remaining protesters scattered, and the St Louis County Police Department's homicide unit was sent to investigate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Dozens of officers from around the region also arrived to secure the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>A group of officers in tactical gear carefully walked up the hill across from the police station where Mr Rayford and other witnesses said the shots had come from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>By 2am, a handful of people remained in the lot across the department, which was encircled in yellow police tape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Investigators tried to interview people in the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>But in a sign of the chasm that remained between law enforcement and this protest movement, many of them were reluctant to talk.</td></tr>

<h3>St. Joseph?s Coach Phil Martelli Finds Grandson Mellows Him</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>On Thursday, while Philip Stephen's 5-year-old classmates were studying the letter T (his favorite T words are turtle and taxi), he attended the A-10 tournament at Barclays Center, dressed in a custom suit created by the tailor of St. Joseph's Coach Phil Martelli, Philip Stephen's grandfather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Phil Martelli's grandson is a fixture at Hawks games, where he mimics the coach's motions, like rubbing his hand under his chin or standing with his arms folded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Phil Martelli, who has won 375 games, is Philip Stephen's idol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>And since Philip Stephen's family moved in with Phil and his wife, Judy, in 2011, the grandson has mellowed the coach and provided a salve for family sadness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I've noticed a little bit of a change in him," Judy Martelli said of her husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"One of the game days, I had to laugh because he was playing hide and seek. That would have never happened when our children were growing up."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Since 1995, when Phil Martelli was hired at St. Joseph's, he has had certain steadfast habits, like working out at the same time and laying out his clothes in a particular way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His wife, who played on the Immaculata College team that won the first women's basketball national championship, in 1972, knew to stay away from him before games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One day, Philip Stephen entered Phil's room as he was preparing for a game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Judy chased after him, but Phil allowed his grandson to stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Philip Stephen sat nearby, memorizing how his grandfather tied his shoes and what order he put his clothes on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"From that day, he did exactly the same thing in the same order," Judy Martelli said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For St. Joseph's second-round game against St. Bonaventure on Thursday, a 60-49 loss that ended the Hawks' season at 13-18, Philip Stephen, one of five grandchildren, wore a pink tie (as his grandfather did) and a pink handkerchief, given to him by his father, Phil Jr., an assistant coach at Delaware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Philip Stephen rode with the team on the bus to Brooklyn on Wednesday, and on the trip from the team hotel to the arena before Thursday's game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He brought along a drawing that spelled out various A-10 teams and a dry-erase board, so he could concoct plays while his grandfather did the same on the bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Before the game, while watching his favorite players, including DeAndre' Bembry and Chris Wilson, warm up, Philip Stephen held court on a variety of subjects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The boy calls his grandfather Tug, which stands for The Unnamed Grandfather - the grandchildren originally could not think of a proper nickname.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Philip Stephen wants to become a construction worker one day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Philip Stephen, who plays basketball in a Y.M.C.A. recreational league, was also adamant that he preferred his grandfather's St. Joseph's Hawks to his father's Delaware Blue Hens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"They're my first favorite team," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Delaware's my second."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At last year's A-10 tournament, Philip Stephen became a star after television cameras captured him in action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In the days afterward, he was interviewed during St. Joseph's N.C.A.A. tournament run and on various television newscasts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Although he now speaks eloquently and with precision - as when he tells his grandmother when he has to use the bathroom - Philip Stephen was not always so loquacious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Judy Martelli said that when he was 2, a family pediatrician questioned his verbal capabilities, but soon after he started speaking in more complete sentences and with a bigger vocabulary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Since then, Philip Stephen's words have often helped heal the family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>In 2013, over a five-week span, Phil's sister and sister-in-law died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>This past year, both of Judy's parents died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"They bring a smile to your face," Judy Martelli said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The kids would be there and say things to you like, 'Nanny's in heaven now.' It just makes you feel a little better, put things in perspective."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Phil Jr.; his wife, Meghan; and their 2-year-old daughter, Marra, did not attend Thursday's games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>So Philip Stephen sat with his grandmother, eating french fries in between the folded-arm poses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>During timeouts on Thursday, Philip Stephen danced to St. Joseph's fight song and yelled, "Miss it!" to Bonnies on the free-throw line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>After a jump-ball call that Phil Martelli thought should have been a foul on St. Bonaventure, Philip Stephen extended his arms in disbelief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>After the game, the grandson followed the coach into the interview room, both having removed their suit jackets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Philip Stephen shook the hand of St. Bonaventure Coach Mark Schmidt and congratulated him on the victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"His parents deserve a lot of credit for the way he's been raised - and the players don't blink," Phil Martelli said of his grandson's presence around the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"I appreciate that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Phil admitted that before Philip Stephen and family moved in, he often put his team first and his family second, but now the dynamic is balanced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"I wasn't crazy about how aggressive I went at some of the players," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>"He and his sister take the edge off game day for me."</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>He added: "Some of the things are small things. Like when I came out of the locker room, I said, 'How are you doing?' and he said, 'I'm not doing good because we don't play tomorrow.' You're trying to do this for more than just the players in the locker room."</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>As Phil, his wife and their grandson walked toward the St. Joseph's locker room and eventually the team bus, Philip Stephen peppered his grandfather with questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"Is there a team meal?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"Yes," the coach replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"When's your first game next year?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Philip Stephen asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>"Are you still going to be coach?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>"Yes," Martelli answered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"I am."</td></tr>
