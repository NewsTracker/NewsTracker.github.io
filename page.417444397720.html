<h3>Top Google search: &#039;Who is Martin O&#039;Malley?&#039;</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Top Google search: 'Who is Martin O'Malley?'</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The top Google search about former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) following his presidential announcement was "Who is Martin O'Malley?", according to data analyzed by CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Other top queries include "Is Martin O'Malley a Democrat?", "How old is Martin O'Malley?" and "How tall is Martin O'Malley?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The queries suggest an electorate that is looking to flesh out their understanding of O'Malley's biography - with interest in his religion and family life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But searches from before he announced his plan to challenge frontrunner Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination on Saturday indicate that potential voters are interested in his policy positions, too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the week leading up to the announcement, users searched responses to questions including "How does Martin O'Malley feel about the Iran nuclear agreement?" and "Does Martin O'Malley support abortion?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Who is Martin O'Malley? remained the top search, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>O'Malley is looking to distinguish his candidacy in a field that is dominated by Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>His campaign will look to push back against the impression that Americans are not familiar with him or his time in the governor's mansion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That will likely include getting the word out on digital platforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the 24 hours surrounding his announcement, 84,000 people in the U.S. generated interactions on Facebook - including shares, likes, comments and statuses - related to his campaign launch.</td></tr>
