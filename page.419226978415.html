<h3>Malaysia Airlines Crash Investigators to Examine Possible Missile Parts in Eastern Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Investigators said on Tuesday that they had found what could be parts originating from a Buk surface-to-air missile system in eastern Ukraine, the area where Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Dutch prosecutors said that the parts could help provide clues for a criminal investigation into what caused the plane to come down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They cautioned, however, that it was too early to draw a "causal connection" between the parts and the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The plane was traveling to the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, from Amsterdam on July 17, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>All 298 people on board were killed in the crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"These parts have been secured during a previous recovery-mission in eastern Ukraine and are in possession of the criminal investigation team and the Dutch Safety Board," the investigators said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ukraine and some Western countries, including the United States, have said they believe the Malaysian jet was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile fired from territory in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In September, the Dutch Safety Board issued a preliminary report that said evidence from the crash was consistent with an attack by a surface-to-air missile, although it did not attempt to assign responsibility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A number of news reports, including in the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, have indicated that the missile system used to shoot down the aircraft was supplied by the Russian military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Russia has denied any involvement in the crash, and Russian officials have said that the plane was shot down by a Ukrainian missile or warplane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Russia has opposed a United Nations resolution that would create an international tribunal to prosecute those responsible for bringing down the plane.</td></tr>
