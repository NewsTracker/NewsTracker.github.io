<h3>Greek negotiators in Brussels to explore deal possibility</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cranes operate at the construction site of the Stavros Niarchos Culture Center where the new opera house and national library will be completed in 2016, in southern Athens, on Monday, June 8, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greek bailout negotiators sought Monday to narrow their differences with international creditors following days of acrimony over rival reform proposals for a deal to unlock Greece's remaining rescue funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said negotiators were in Brussels to explore the "scope for convergence" with creditors and indicated there was room for negotiation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He also sought to douse talk of elections, saying it was not something the government was considering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some ministers had raised the issue as an option if a deal cannot be reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Talks between Greece and its creditors have been deadlocked since late last week, when Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rejected as unacceptable a proposal made by the three institutions overseeing his country's bailout - the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sakellaridis reiterated that Greece considers its proposal - a 47-page document delivered by Tsipras during a visit to Brussels last week - to be the basis for a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The Greek negotiating team that has gone to Brussels is evidently there so as to see the scope for convergence so there can be a mutually acceptable solution to both sides," Sakellaridis said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The two sides disagree on a number of issues, such as pension cuts and labor reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Each side has said it is expecting a response to its own proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A solution is needed by June 30, when Greece's bailout program ends and the remaining 7.2 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in rescue loans will no longer be available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Without the funds, Greece cannot repay its debts and could end up crashing out of Europe's joint currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the end of a G-7 meeting in Elmau, Germany, that she wants Greece to remain in the eurozone but that Athens has to implement reforms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Worries of a Greek default and euro exit kept European stock markets in check Monday with the Stoxx 50 index trading 0.5 percent lower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The main stock market in Athens recouped some recent lost ground, trading up 0.5 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank said the "room for manoeuver looks limited" for both sides noting that hardliners within Tsipras' radical left party and the government's nationalist coalition partner "may oppose almost any condition which lenders must attach to the disbursement of money."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And on the lenders' side, he said the IMF and - to a lesser extent - the ECB "seem to be against any further concessions to Greece."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>However, he estimated, "after some further huffing and puffing, Tsipras will have to either accept the deal on offer with just minor face-saving modifications or risk crashing Greece out of the euro."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Schmieding put the chances of the latter at 30 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Jitters over Greece swelled when the government delayed a payment due last Friday to the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Instead, it opted to bundle all four IMF repayments due this month into one on June 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Allowed under IMF rules, the option has been used only once, by Zambia in the 1980s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tsipras on Friday described the institutions' proposals as an "unpleasant surprise," saying they ignored progress in negotiations over the past few months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The rejection sparked the ire of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who is considered more lenient towards Greece than the IMF, ECB and Germany, which is the largest single eurozone contributor to Greece's bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We will continue to work for a solution," Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said in Brussels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"There is a position of the three institutions which is a good basis for finding a solution, provided that all sides concentrate on the remaining issues to be solved."</td></tr>
