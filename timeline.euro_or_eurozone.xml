    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Greece is unlikely to exit the euro, either intentionally or accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it might be forced to introduce an alternative means of payment, in parallel to the euro, to pay some domestic bills if a reform-for-cash deal with its creditors is not secured soon, several euro zone officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At some point, when the government has no more euros to pay salaries or bills, it might start issuing IOUs -- a paper saying that its holder would receive an x number of euros at a point in time in the future," one senior euro zone official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such IOUs would then quickly start trading in secondary circulation at a deep discount to the real euros and they would become a 'currency', whatever its name would be, that would exist in parallel to the euro," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The arrangement could be temporary to keep the government going as it hopes to negotiate a deal with creditors that would unlock more euros in loans," a second euro zone official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they were to default, it is better to do that inside the euro zone rather than outside, because then it would become a problem of all the countries sharing the euro, rather than just Greece," a third official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no means of forcing a country out of the euro zone or out of the European Union and Greece has no intention of leaving on its own," the second euro zone official said.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (AP) - German factory orders, a key indicator for Europe's biggest economy, dropped much further than expected in January, led by a big drop in demand from other eurozone countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fall was led by a 9 percent drop in orders from elsewhere in the 19-nation eurozone, while domestic orders fell 2.5 percent and demand from other nations slipped 2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy is in generally robust shape, with domestic demand strong thanks in part to low oil prices and a weaker euro set to help exports.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like most Western economies, consumer spending is a bedrock for economic growth in the eurozone and the fact that it's growing strongly and consistently - up for four straight months for the first time since records began in 2000 - is a positive signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro has fallen sharply in recent months and is trading at around 11-year lows against the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Markit found that economic activity increased across each of the 'big four' eurozone economies - Germany, France, Italy and Spain - for the first time since April, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
