<h3>Microsoft must face Xbox 360 class action claims</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Microsoft Corp must face class action claims by Xbox 360 owners who say the video game console has a design defect that causes game discs to be gouged, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle said a lower court judge misapplied the law in finding that Xbox owners in the United States could not sue for damages as a group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It did not decide whether a class action should be certified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Class actions can lead to larger damages or broader remedies than individual lawsuits, which can be costly to pursue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Microsoft has sold tens of millions of Xbox 360 consoles since their Nov. 2005 launch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But owners have claimed that the console's optical disc drive cannot withstand even small vibrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They said this causes game discs to spin out of control and become scratched even under normal playing conditions, rendering them unplayable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Microsoft countered that class certification was improper because just 0.4 % of Xbox owners reported disc scratches, and that misuse was the cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In March 2012, U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez in Seattle dismissed the class-action claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He relied on a 2009 ruling in a similar case in which another judge said the dearth of complaints ruled out class certification.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But the 9th Circuit reversed the decision underpinning that ruling in 2010, in a case addressing whether a suspected defect caused premature tire wear in Land Rover vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The appeals court said Martinez did not properly take this reversal into account when he deferred to the 2009 ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Plaintiffs' breach of express warranty claim presents a common factual question-is there a defect?-and a common mixed question of law and fact-does that defect breach the express warranty?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Circuit Judge Johnnie Rawlinson wrote for the appeals court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The district court erred in finding that individual issues of causation predominate over these common questions."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The 9th Circuit returned the case to Martinez for further proceedings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We've won in the lower court previously and believe the facts are on our side," said a spokesman for Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Benjamin Gould, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients are pleased with the decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The case is Baker et al v.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Microsoft Corp, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>12-35946.</td></tr>
