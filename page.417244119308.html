<tr><td>3</td><td>The movie was one of 19 competing for the Palme d'Or, which is one of the most prestigious awards in cinema.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>"The background is like wallpaper."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"The film is a more love story than a thriller," he said, with Dheepan travelling to France with a woman and a young girl he meets in a refugee camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They form a fake family in the hope of improving their chances of securing asylum in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>However, Dheepan soon finds he needs the skills he honed as a fighter in Sri Lanka to protect his new family in the war zone of Paris' tough suburbs.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>The Grand Prix is the festival's second prize, after the Palme d'Or.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Cannes' third prize, the jury prize, went to Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos for his offbeat social satire, "The Lobster."</td></tr>
