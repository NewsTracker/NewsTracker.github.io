<tr><td>2</td><td>The deal includes tough economic measures that Greece will need to pass into law quickly before it can get any new loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A statement from the summit of euro leaders says these "minimum requirements" do not guarantee a successful result for the bailout negotiations.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>- Privatize the electricity transmission network operator unless alternative measures with the same effect can be found.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>The government must consult with the institutions on all relevant draft legislation before submitting it to public consultation or to parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>- Re-examine, with a view to amend, legislation passed in the last six months that is deemed to have backtracked on previous bailout commitments.</td></tr>
