<h3>Spartans Final Four-bound after 76-70 OT win over Louisville (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The senior guard's vow lasted no more than 10 seconds once the final horn sounded following Michigan State's 76-70 overtime victory over Louisville in a thrilling NCAA Tournament East Regional final Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Amid the frenzied celebration, Trice squatted down at center court and began to sob uncontrollably.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>''I was actually trying to hold it in,'' Trice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''I try to keep it even keeled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That's when senior forward Branden Dawson interjected by saying that was the first time he's ever seen Trice cry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Counted out for done as recently as six weeks ago, the seventh-seeded Spartans (27-11) let it all out in a thrilling display of perseverance and defensive grit to oust the fourth-seeded Cardinals (27-9).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''I'd like to tell you that I thought five different times this year that we were good enough to get to a Final Four, but I'd be lying to you,'' said coach Tom Izzo, who described this as the best of seven regional final victories he has enjoyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''But I think the burning desire to be in this Final Four, and they didn't want to be a group that didn't make it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Trice led the Spartans with 17 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Dawson had 11 rebounds, including a key putback of Bryn Forbes' missed 3-point shot with 31.7 seconds left in overtime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And Denzel Valentine scored 15 points for a Michigan State team that won for the 12th time in 15 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's a run that included them knocking off second-seeded Virginia last weekend and third-seeded Oklahoma in the regional semifinal on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Michigan State will face Duke, which beat Gonzaga 66-52 in the South Regional final, on Saturday in Indianapolis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Wayne Blackshear had 28 points for the Cardinals (27-9) in a game that featured 11 lead changes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>There could have been a 12th with 4.9 seconds left in regulation, when Cardinals forward Mangok Mathiang hit his first free throw to tie the game on a shot that hit off the heel of the rim and bounced high and in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But he wasn't so fortunate on his second one, which also hit the heel and bounced wide left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''Sometimes it can be a cruel game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>I was positive we were going to win it when the first free throw went in because it shouldn't have gone in,'' Cardinals coach Rick Pitino said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''It's very difficult for all the players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Louisville was denied a shot of making its third Final Four in four years, and 11th overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It's the ninth Final Four appearance for the Spartans, and first since 2010, when they lost 52-50 to Butler in the national semifinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Izzo has led them to seven Final Fours including the 2000 national championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Spartans did it with a roster that was regarded as having less talent than the team that lost in the regional final to Connecticut a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Michigan State lost three of its top four scorers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''Everybody doubted us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Everybody had us down and out,'' Valentine said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''They didn't have us making the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>We just kept strong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Spartans rallied from a 40-32 halftime deficit to eventually build a 61-59 lead with 3:57 left, when Trice hit two free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Michigan State took control in overtime, starting with Forbes hitting a 3-pointer 26 seconds in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Spartans then sealed it in the final 31 seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Dawson did what Izzo's teams have done well over the years: He put back a 3-point miss by Forbes to put Michigan State up 74-70.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Valentine batted away Quentin Snider's pass into the paint on the Cardinals' next possession, and Trice sealed the win by hitting two free throws with 10.1 seconds left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Michigan State's defense - Izzo's other trademark - played havoc with the Cardinals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>After hitting 17 of 32 attempts in the first half, Louisville managed to make six of its final 32.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It is the third straight year one conference has had two teams in the Final Four.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The Southeastern Conference did last year with Kentucky and Florida and the Big East had Louisville and Syracuse in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The last time the Big Ten did it was 2005 with Michigan State and Illinois.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Though Blackshear stepped up his performance in what became his final collegiate game, Cardinals junior forward Montrezl Harrell struggled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Harrell missed his last five shots and was off on five of nine free throw attempts in what was also his final game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Harrell has already indicated his intention to enter the NBA draft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>''It hurts a lot,'' Harrell said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>''It's over,'' added Blackshear, a member of the Cardinals 2013 national championship team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Blackshear had his nose bloodied with 3:57 left, when he hit a driving layup and was fouled hard by Matt Costello.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Dillon Avare came off the bench to hit the free throw while Blackshear missed a few possessions while being tended to on the bench.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Michigan State: Izzo improved to 13-9 when facing a higher seed in the NCAA Tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>... The Spartans evened their tournament record against Louisville to 2-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The Cardinals beat the Spartans in the 2012 West Regional semifinal, while the Spartans beat the Cardinals in the 2009 Midwest Regional final.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Louisville also beat Michigan State in 1959.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Louisville: The Cardinals dropped to 52-10 when facing a lower seed in the NCAA Tournament, while coach Rick Pitino dropped to 53-18.</td></tr>
