<tr><td>2</td><td>BRUSSELS Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has been given an extra two weeks to respond to European Union charges of abusing its market power in a dozen EU countries and stave off a possible billion-euro fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The European Commission has extended the deadline for replying to the charges until Aug. 31, a Google spokesman said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Internet company was previously given until Aug. 17 to respond to the Commission's charge sheet, or statement of objections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Commission, which in April accused Google of distorting web search results to favor its shopping service, confirmed it had accepted the company's request for additional time to reply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"In line with normal practice, the Commission analyzed the reasons for the request. As a result, it has granted an extension allowing Google to fully exercise its rights of defence," Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's charges in April escalated a five-year investigation which Google previously tried to settle three times, without success.</td></tr>
