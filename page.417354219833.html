<h3>Australia want Blatter ousted from FIFA</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The embattled head of world soccer, FIFA President Sepp Blatter, is expected to be re-elected on Friday despite growing calls for his resignation amid a corruption scandal that has engulfed the sport's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>At a meeting in Zurich starting at 0730 GMT, up to 209 FIFA members will choose between Blatter, who is seeking his fifth term as president, and his sole challenger Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Anger within Europe's powerful regional soccer body UEFA and other members over the damage allegations of graft are doing to FIFA is unlikely to be enough to topple the 79-year-old Swiss, who is backed by the Asian and African confederations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The maths appears to be in Blatter's favour, despite some countries saying they were switching allegiance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Friday, New Zealand Football said it would vote for 39-year-old Prince Ali despite a previous unanimous commitment from countries in the Oceania Football Confederation in January to back Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Given the developments in the past 48 hours - which have been deeply distressing for all of us who love football - New Zealand Football believes substantive change is now essential within FIFA as soon as possible to repair its tarnished reputation," NZF President Mark Aspden said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In his first public appearance since Wednesday's dramatic events, when leading soccer officials were arrested in a dawn raid on their luxury Swiss hotel, Blatter said on Thursday that there was no room "for corruption of any kind".</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The events of (Wednesday) have cast a long shadow over football and this Congress," Blatter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He also sought to distance himself from the scandal, the biggest crisis FIFA has faced in its 111-year history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I know many people hold me ultimately responsible ... (but) I cannot monitor everyone all the time. If people want to do wrong, they will also try to hide it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nine soccer officials and five sports media and promotions executives have been charged by U.S. prosecutors with corruption they said involved more than $150 million in bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Swiss authorities also announced a criminal investigation into the awarding of the next two World Cup tournaments, which are being hosted in Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Both countries deny any suggestion of wrongdoing over their bids to host one of the world's top sporting events, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of meddling in an effort to prevent the re-election of Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Adding to the pressure on FIFA and Blatter, there are growing concerns from major sponsors, many of whom have solidly backed the organisation despite nearly 20 years of bribery and corruption allegations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Football Federation Australia will vote against Sepp Blatter retaining the presidency of FIFA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Australia want Sepp Blatter ousted as FIFA president in the wake of the unprecedented corruption scandal engulfing football.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>"FFA believes that profound change within FIFA is needed as soon as possible to address issues of governance and transparency," FFA chairman Frank Lowy said in a statement on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"This belief will be reflected when Australia casts its vote in the presidential election, should it proceed on Friday (European time) in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The board of FFA has reviewed the manifesto for change proposed by Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein and believes it provides the basis for a fresh start for FIFA."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Lowy's statement came soon after he arrived in Zurich amid the ongoing corruption scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The scheduled FIFA congress, and presidential vote slated for Saturday AEST, could be postponed in the wake of 14 people, including nine current or former FIFA office holders, being arrested on corruption charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Police arrested seven current FIFA officials in dawn raids at a luxury Zurich hotel at the behest of United States authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The seven are among 14 people, including one with dubious connections to Australia's failed bid to host the 2022 World Cup, charged with racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The US is seeking their extradition to face charges they conspired to solicit and receive more than $US150 million ($A194 million) in bribes and kickbacks, in exchange for their support of marketing executives who agreed to make the illegal payments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>US authorities say those charged face up to 20 years in jail if found guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The arrests came as Swiss investigators separately raided the head offices of FIFA in Zurich in a fresh probe into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively.</td></tr>

<tr><td>30</td><td>Read more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The corruption charges engulfing football's governing body have heaped shame and humiliation on the game, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said on Thursday, although he flatly rejected calls to resign over the scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>With FIFA facing the worst crisis in its 111-year history, Michel Platini, who heads Europe's football confederation UEFA, said he had told Blatter to go "with tears in my eyes", but the 79-year-old had refused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"I said, 'I'm asking you to leave, FIFA's image is terrible.' He said that he couldn't leave all of a sudden," Platini, a former French international, told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>In a bullish speech opening a FIFA Congress in Zurich, Blatter said the turbulence of the last two days, which included the arrest of leading soccer officials at their luxury Swiss hotel, had brought "shame and humiliation" to world football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Making his first public appearance since Wednesday's dramatic events, which were triggered by a US-led investigation into allegations of rampant bribe-taking, Blatter said there was no room "for corruption of any kind".</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"The events of yesterday have cast a long shadow over football and this Congress," said Blatter, who is standing for a fifth mandate as FIFA president in Friday's election, where Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan is his only challenger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Ignoring calls to step down, Blatter said: "I know many people hold me ultimately responsible ... (but) I cannot monitor everyone all the time. If people want to do wrong, they will also try to hide it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Platini said 45 or 46 of UEFA's 53 member associations would vote for Prince Ali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>But it appeared that Blatter still commanded enough of FIFA's 209 national associations to secure victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>@lesmurraySBS thinks it would be foolish to delay the #FIFA presidential vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Football commentator Les Murray says the FIFA election must go ahead to ensure embattled FIFA president Sepp Blatter is deposed, following the arrest of seven football officials on corruption charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Meanwhile FIFA's blue-chip sponsors, many of whom have solidly backed FIFA despite nearly 20 years of bribery and corruption allegations, appeared to be growing unexpectedly concerned at events unfolding in Zurich.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The Football World Cup is as big as it gets and the visibility for sponsors like Adidas is unrivaled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>But as a corruption scandal rocks FIFA and a number of its senior officials, major sponsors are deciding how to respond.</td></tr>

<tr><td>46</td><td>Who has been indicted in FIFA corruption probe?</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Nine high-ranking soccer officials, including two current vice-presidents of world governing body FIFA, and five sports marketing executives, have been indicted on federal corruption charges, US law enforcement officials said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>The US Justice Department has charged five executives and nine officials of soccer's global governing body, FIFA, with racketeering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Football commentator Les Murray says the upcoming FIFA election should go ahead because it's the best chance to depose President Sepp Blatter, despite calls from the UEFA that it be postponed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"I don't think FIFA's credibility will be restored unless Blatter goes. And the best chance of him being outvoted is if the elections stay where they are, because the story is still hot," Murray said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Blatter is hoping to secure his fifth term as FIFA's president at an election to be held on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>In an opinion piece for The World Game, Murray said Blatter had blown his chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>"When Blatter was re-elected in 2011, amid much hullabaloo barely six months after the grubby exco vote that gave World Cup hosting rights to Russia and Qatar, he was given a wonderful opportunity and blew it. Already 75 at the time, it should have been his last term," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Independent senator Nick Xenophon has urged the federal government to denounce FIFA president Sepp Blatter and request a fresh vote for the 2022 World Cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Australians should be worried about the $45 million it spent on a "fixed" bidding process to host the event after several top FIFA officials were arrested on corruption charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>"The beautiful game has been turned into an incredibly ugly business," Senator Xenophon told reporters in Canberra on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Both the Australian government and Football Federation Australia needed to speak out about Blatter and the need for reform at FIFA to restore some integrity in the sport, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>"I think once you get some countries such as Australia speaking out, the dam will break and many others will speak out on this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>The Greens believe a parliamentary inquiry into Australia's unsuccessful bid is needed to get to "the bottom of where all of $40 million spent on the bid ended up".</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>Senator Xenophon also called on FFA to formally report to US authorities a $500,000 payment it made to former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who is facing eight counts of corruption.</td></tr>
