<h3>New wife arrives for Bali Nine funeral</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A container believed to be carrying the Bali Nine ringleaders' bodies was escorted from the tarmac at Sydney airport about 6.30am on Saturday, having landed in Australia three days after they were shot by an Indonesian firing squad for their part in a heroin-smuggling plot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chan's widow and Sukumaran's family arrived in Sydney with their bodies, a day after Chan's grieving family flew home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But while those in mourning organise funerals, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has to think about the future of Australia's dealings with Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He says he is confident the relationship will be repaired despite Indonesia's execution of Chan and Sukumaran - alongside six other offenders - in defiance of international pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It really was terrible that these cruel and unnecessary executions went ahead. That said, we do have to respect Indonesia's sovereignty," Mr Abbott said in Sydney on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I am confident that we will be able to rebuild the relationship. It's important ... Australian and Indonesian friendship is strong and growing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Abbott echoed the previous day's comments by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who said it was time to move on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I was aware of a number of Indonesian politicians, business people who were deeply disturbed by the events of the past week," she told reporters in Perth on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I think it's time for us to seek to move on."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Meanwhile, Chan's widow is involved in organising his funeral just days after she married him during his last hours on death row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Febyanti Herewila has joined Chan's family to wish him a final farewell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Ms Herewila touched down just after 6am on Saturday and was escorted by government officials through a private exit at Sydney airport, along with Sukumaran's mother Raji, brother Chintu and sister Brintha.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Looking tired, with hands on their bowed heads, the family made no comment as they left the airport and got into three white cars that had been waiting for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 34, were executed on the island of Nusakambangan at 12.25am local time (0325 AEST) on Wednesday, 10 years after they were caught in Bali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Chan's brother Michael and mother Helen arrived back in Sydney on Friday ahead of the bodies.</td></tr>
