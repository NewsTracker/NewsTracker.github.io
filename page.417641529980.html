<h3>Judge strikes motion for gag order in Baltimore police case</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A Baltimore judge has rejected a motion for a broad gag order in the case of six police officers charged in the fatal injury of a man in their custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Freddie Gray died April 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The officers face charges ranging from second-degree murder to misdemeanor assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The office of State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby sought to bar attorneys, police and witnesses from speaking publicly about the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Circuit Judge Charles Peters ruled last week that the request lacked standing because it was filed May 14 in Circuit Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The officers' cases were in District Court until May 21, when they were indicted and the case transferred to Circuit Court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Defense attorneys asked the judge to strike the motion on procedural grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Media organizations, including The Associated Press, also opposed it.</td></tr>
