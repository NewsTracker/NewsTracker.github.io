<h3>Twenty-three-year-old model who was last to see Boris Nemtsov alive is now receiving death threats</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The General Prosecutor's office in Kyiv said in a statement Friday that Anna Duritskaya -the 23-year old model who was walking with Nemtsov at the time of his killing - is being provided with protection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The statement offered no information on who might have issued the threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Duritskaya, told Russian Dozhd television that Nemtsov was shot from behind, but said she hadn't seen the attacker, nor could she identify the license plate or make of the getaway car the gunman then sped away in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She was detained by Russian police for several days of questioning before she was allowed to return to her hometown of Kyiv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I didn't see anything," she told Russia's independent TV channel Dozhd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I turned around and all I saw was a light-colored car. I saw neither the brand, nor the license plate of the car when it was driving away."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the slaying of his top critic a "disgrace" to Russia, although scant progress has been made in the investigation into the shooting last Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Another leading Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny was released Friday after spending 15 days in custody and vowed that he and his supporters will not be intimidated by the slaying of a top Kremlin critic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Navalny, the driving force behind the 2011-2012 mass protests in Moscow, said the killing of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov will not lead him to scale down his campaign against President Vladimir Putin's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This act of terror hasn't achieved its goal, it will not frighten me or my comrades," Navalny said after his release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We will not reduce our efforts, we will not step back."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Navalny walked free after serving the sentence handed down by a Moscow court, which found him guilty of violating the law when he distributed leaflets in the subway campaigning for an opposition rally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The protest was turned into a mourning march to pay tributes to Nemtsov.</td></tr>
