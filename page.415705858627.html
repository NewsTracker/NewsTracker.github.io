<h3>Police Investigating Link Between Robert Durst and Vermont Student Who Went Missing in 1971</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Vermont police are investigating a link between creepy-as-hell real-estate heir Robert Durst and an 18-year-old Middlebury student who went missing in 1971, according to the Burlington Free Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Middlebury freshman Lynne Schulze disappeared on December 10, 1971 after being seen eating dried prunes bought at the health-food store Durst and his then-wife Kathie operated, All Good Things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Her friends believe she was originally going to take a bus to New York, but after missing it, was headed back to campus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Though the only evidence that Durst had anything to do with Schulze's disappearance is that their timelines overlapped, police are still investigating the possibility of his involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are aware of the connection between Robert Durst and the disappearance of Lynne Schulze," Middlebury Police Chief Tom Hanley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead."</td></tr>
