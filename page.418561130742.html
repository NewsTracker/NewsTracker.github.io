<h3>Hillary Clinton spends $18 million, hires hundreds</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton walks out of the weekly policy luncheon with Senate Democrats on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, July 14, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Hillary Rodham Clinton spent more than $18 million and hired hundreds of employees in the first three months of her presidential campaign, creating a national operation that vastly outpaces her rivals in both parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She has the money for it, having raised more than $46 million for the Democratic primary contest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But building a campaign Goliath hasn't come cheap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton spent more than $5.9 million on 343 employees, $700,000 on computers and other equipment, and nearly half a million renting offices, including her 80,000-square-foot Brooklyn headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Beyond paying for salaries and space, her campaign purchased lists of voters in four early primary states, paid six figures to a super PAC devoted to defending her record and spent heavily on building a digital team, according to campaign finance documents filed Wednesday with federal regulators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It's a strategy aimed at a contest that's nearly a year away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The overwhelming favorite for her party's nomination, Clinton's team has set its sights on building the massive infrastructure they'll need for the general election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The outlay is nearly four times what Clinton spent in the first three months of her last presidential campaign, when she faced a far more competitive primary race against then-Sen. Barack Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>During that 2008 campaign, Clinton and her team faced charges from donors that they were wasting money on ineffective strategic choices - like spending nearly $100,000 for party platters and groceries before the Iowa caucus, a contest she lost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This time, her staff has emphasized its "cheapskate" mentality - particularly to contributors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At her first national finance meeting in May, top donors were instructed to purchase their own lunches and fund their own transportation to various gatherings in Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Campaign aides like to brag about taking the bus from New York to Washington, rather than the more expensive Acela train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Even so, her campaign spent at least $8,700 on train tickets and just a few hundred dollars on bus fare, the Federal Election Commission report shows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>All told, Clinton has spent a far greater portion of her early funds during this campaign than she did eight years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>During the first three months of her 2008 bid, Clinton spent 14 percent of the $36 million she raised, according to FEC documents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In the launch of this campaign, she's burned though nearly 40 percent of what she has taken in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Her campaign also reported that Clinton received more than 250,000 contributions, with an average donation of $144.89.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>About 17 percent of her contributions were $200 or less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>By comparison, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has fueled an insurgent challenge to Clinton with small donations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He pulled in more than $15.2 million through the end of June, and three-quarters of his donations were $200 or less.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Though they've highlighted their lower-dollar contributions, Clinton's team also released a list of campaign bundlers who each raised more than $100,000 for her primary bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some of the donors included Clinton's most ardent financial backers, including Hollywood media mogul Haim Saban; Susie Tompkins Buell, a wealthy California investor who was a major donor to the Ready for Hillary super PAC; Las Vegas publisher Brian Greenspun, a longtime friend and college classmate of Bill Clinton; billionaire J.B. Pritzker of Chicago; and Alan Patricof, a New York-based financier who served as Clinton's finance chair when she first ran for Senate in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Clinton's team also successfully courted some of Obama's biggest backers, including New York financiers Marc Lasry, Charles Myers and Blair Effron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Others included former Clinton aides like Minyon Moore, Tom Nides and Lisa Caputo, former Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, and current members of Congress like Reps.</td></tr>
