<h3>Former Oriole Markakis returns to Baltimore with Braves</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Atlanta Braves right fielder Nick Markakis catches a fly ball hit by St. Louis Cardinals' Jhonny Peralta during the fourth inning of a baseball game Saturday, July 25, 2015, in St. Louis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Sitting in the visiting dugout at Camden Yards, Nick Markakis felt at home and a bit out of place at the same time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Markakis played his entire major league career with the Orioles before signing during the offseason with the Atlanta Braves, who were in town Monday for the start of a three-game series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"I'd spent nine years here and I'd never even been in this clubhouse or this dugout," Markakis said before batting practice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"So that tells you a little bit about how I feel. It's a little weird, but you know, life throws you a bunch of curves and it's all about how you deal with it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While with the Orioles, Markakis hit .290 with 141 homers and 658 RBIs in 1,365 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He thought he would spend his entire career in Baltimore, but the Orioles opted not to match Atlanta's contract offer of $44 million over four years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I understand the business aspect of baseball now," Markakis, 31, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"It's a tough thing to go through - especially when you're attached to a baseball team, an organization for so long. It took a little time to get over it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His association with Baltimore extended well beyond Camden Yards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Markakis and his wife, Christina, were an integral part of the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"He'll be received very well," Orioles manager Buck Showalter predicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We have intelligent fans and they know the contribution he made to not only the organization, but the city, on and off the field."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Markakis was penciled into the Atlanta lineup as the leadoff hitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He came in batting .286 with one homer and 32 RBIs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We all know he's going to get about nine hits the next three days," Showalter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Markakis was asked how it might feel seeing Showalter across the diamond in the opposing team's dugout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's going to be a little different," Markakis acknowledged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"But at the end of the day, I've got a job to do, and that's to try and beat these guys."</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Most other times, however, Markakis roots for his former teammates.</td></tr>
