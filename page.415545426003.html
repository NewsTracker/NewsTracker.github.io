<h3>Crimea exiles fight to keep Ukraine unity message alive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For 11 days, Andrei Schekun was locked him in a dank room and tortured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the torture took place as Crimea voted in a referendum to secede from Ukraine a year ago Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Schekun's crime: campaigning to persuade his fellow Crimeans to reject absorption by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>SHCHASLYVE, Ukraine (AP) - The tormentors stuck scotch tape to his eyes and locked him in a dank room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>For 11 days, Andrei Schekun said, they beat him, shocked him with electrodes and scalded him with burning metallic plates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Schekun's crusade for Ukrainian unity, which he continues today in exile, began as pro-Moscow sentiment among the majority ethnic Russian population reached fever pitch on the peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Demands for a split from Ukraine spiked within days of the February ouster of Moscow-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Although most Ukrainians resented the president with feverish intensity for his predatory rule, people in regions such as Crimea and eastern Ukraine, with dominant ethnic Russian populations, viewed him with more sympathy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Russian state television stations already fed them a steady diet of stories about unrest being led by rabid Ukrainian nationalists bent on oppression of the Russian population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ill-intentioned Ukrainians, the Russian networks warned, were poised to descend upon Crimea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Schekun's activism in drumming up support in Crimea for the anti-government protests that toppled Yanukovych was enough to make him suspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Soon flyers appeared in the courtyard outside Schekun's home in the Crimean town of Bakhchysarai describing him as a traitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Everywhere in the district where we lived, they stuck up leaflets with his face, calling him a bloodthirsty traitor and a fascist, and all kinds of other things," said Schekun's wife, Lyudmila, speaking from their new home outside Kiev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Schekun, along with his wife and three sons, are among the roughly 20,000 people who Ukrainian officials say have left Crimea for the mainland since the region was annexed by Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On March 9, one week before the referendum, plain-clothed policemen detained Schekun at a train station in the Crimean capital of Simferopol, as he awaited the delivery of Ukrainian flags and symbols.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The group was from a self-described militia charged with ensuring the referendum on joining Russia proceeded smoothly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"They thought we wanted to derail their referendum," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"They thought we were some kind of terrorist group or something."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Pro-Ukrainian activism inside Crimea has become an even more dangerous proposition since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Last week, a small group of Crimea residents marked the day of Ukraine's national poet Taras Shevchenko by gathering outside his statue in Simferopol with Ukrainian flags.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That minor act of defiance earned them 40 hours hard labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The peninsula's Tatar minority, whose leadership resisted Russian annexation, says it too has been subjected to intimidation that has ranged from petty official harassment to beatings, kidnappings and murder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Speaking at a United Nations conference in Geneva on Monday, the human rights envoy for Ukraine's parliament, Valeriya Lutkovskaya, described Crimea as a "peninsula of terror."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"People are afraid to express their opinion," Lutkovskaya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"They feel fear for their life and future, fear to espouse their faith and speak in their native language."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>According to the most recent census, carried out in 2001, ethnic Ukrainians make up one-quarter of Crimea's population.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>From a distance, exiles feel at a loss to help and say they are disappointed with the Ukrainian government's failure to keep Crimea near the top of its agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Unfortunately, there is at the moment no single government executive body that deals with Crimean matters," said Eskender Bariyev, a member of the Mejlis, a self-governing body of Crimean Tatars.</td></tr>

<h3>California winery owner, investor die in apparent murder-suicide</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- A troubled winery owner who chased an investor through a Northern California vineyard and shot him in the head at close range as police approached had a silencer in his gun, which could signal the man planned the killing, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>As authorities headed to the scene, the owner of Dahl Vineyards, Robert Dahl, shot a fleeing Emad Tawfilis, who fell to the ground, Sheriff's Capt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Douglas Pike said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Dahl then led police on a short chase that ended with his apparent suicide Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Pike said the use of a silencer could mean Dahl intended to kill Tawfilis when he went to a meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It shows intent, going to that extreme. To me, it indicates somebody put some planning into it," Pike told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat newspaper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tawfilis had called 911 in a panic shortly before noon Monday, saying he was running through grapevines to escape a business partner who was firing at him from behind the wheel of an SUV, Pike said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As authorities headed to the scene, Dahl shot the fleeing investor, who fell to the ground, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Dahl, holding a .22-caliber semi-automatic handgun, got out of the vehicle, "walked up to the victim and appeared to execute him just as the deputies were arriving," Pike said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The 47-year-old vintner returned to his vehicle and led police on a brief chase around Yountville.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Authorities lost sight of him in the woods after he plowed through a gate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They found him minutes later, however, dead in the SUV, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Pike said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 48-year-old Tawfilis was killed near Highway 29, gateway to the Napa wine region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dahl's attorney, Kousha Berokim, said the two men had been discussing a business disagreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The meeting was peaceful and held to develop a framework to resolve their dispute," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"There was certainly no indication of violence."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Dahl and Tawfilis had filed lawsuits against each other over a $1.2 million investment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Dahl said the interest Tawfilis was charging on the loan was illegally high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tawfilis, meanwhile, said Dahl misused funds and fooled him into investing in defunct companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Berokim and David Wiseblood, Tawfilis' lawyer, participated in the settlement talks by phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>After about 20 minutes, the parties agreed to take a short break, and the lawyers hung up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Shortly afterward, however, Tawfilis called police to the winery, saying he had been shot and was fleeing for his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Berokim said the shooting "was out of character" for Dahl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Tawfilis, who lived in Los Gatos, "was a bright and principled man," Wiseblood said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"He went up to Napa to resolve this thing so he could get on with his life. Instead, he lost his life."</td></tr>
