<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN - Chancellor Angela Merkel is asking German lawmakers to clear the way for negotiations on a new, third bailout package for Greece, arguing that it would be negligent not to try for a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After a preliminary agreement on Monday, Germany's government has to get a parliamentary mandate for potentially difficult talks on details of the three-year bailout expected to be worth 85 billion euros ($93 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Merkel told a special session of Parliament on Friday that lawmakers faced "a decision for a strong Europe and a strong eurozone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Bailing out Greece isn't popular among Merkel's conservatives and the chancellor acknowledged concerns over the chances of a successful bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But she said "we would be grossly negligent, even irresponsible, if we did not at least try this road."</td></tr>
