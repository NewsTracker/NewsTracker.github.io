<h3>Kenya Official: I Did Not Cause Delay in Ending Attack</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Kenyans are demanding answers for why it took more than 12 hours to deploy members of the police counter-insurgency unit, the Recce Company, whose officers ended the April 2 siege at Garissa University College by four gunmen from Somalia's al-Shabab Islamic extremist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kenya Police Airwing Commander Rodgers Mbithi said in a statement to police investigators that his decision to allow his daughter-in- law and her children to be flown from Mombasa to Nairobi did not delay the movement of the Recce Company from Nairobi to Garissa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The law permits him to allow his pilots to pick and fly his relatives and civilians, Mbithi said in his statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The in-law family resides at the coast and I was only asking for a lift to Nairobi. The pilot has the discretion of refusing to carry any passenger. He agreed to fly them," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A team of five officers has been appointed to investigate the police air wing over allegations that the unit failed to respond to the needs of the force during the attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mbithi said the air wing has only three serviceable aircraft, including two planes and one small helicopter with capacity of four passengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>On the day of the attack the helicopter had taken a police commander to northern Kenya and the plane had gone to Mombasa for a training exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By the time the flight departed Wilson airport at 7.26 am, the Recce had not been informed of any need to fly to Garissa.</td></tr>
