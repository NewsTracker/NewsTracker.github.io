<h3>Obama tells Netanyahu U.S. to "reassess" policy on Israel, Mideast diplomacy [Video]</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Obama's telephone call to Netanyahu followed a television interview in which the Israeli leader backed away from his pre-election declaration that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch, an about-face apparently aimed at quelling U.S. criticism triggered by his comments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The White House, unmoved by Netanyahu's effort to backtrack, delivered a fresh rebuke against him on Thursday and signaled that Washington may reconsider its decades-old policy of shielding close ally Israel from international pressure at the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An official statement put out later in the day said Obama called Netanyahu to congratulate him on his election win and used the opportunity to reaffirm his commitment to a two-state solution, a longtime cornerstone of U.S. policy on the Middle East conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Obama also delivered a blunt message that underscored the seriousness of the U.S.-Israel rift.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The president told the prime minister that we will need to reassess our options following the prime minister's new positions and comments regarding the two-state solution," the White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>White House spokesman Josh Earnest warned earlier that there would be "consequences" for Israel as the Obama administration monitors the formation of Netanyahu's new ruling coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He walked back from commitments that Israel had previously made to a two-state solution," Earnest told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It is ... cause for the United States to evaluate what our path is forward."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Obama told the Israeli leader he values the close security partnership between their countries and the two agreed to keep consulting on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," the White House said in its statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I haven't changed my policy. I never retracted my speech in Bar-Ilan University six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state," Netanyahu told MSNBC in his first U.S. television interview since winning the bitterly contested Israeli ballot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"What has changed is the reality," Netanyahu said, citing the Palestinian Authority's refusal to recognize Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people and the Hamas militant group's continued control of the Gaza Strip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The harsh U.S. response signaled that relations with Israel, already at their lowest point since Obama took office, could deteriorate further as an end-of-March deadline looms in U.S.-led nuclear diplomacy with Iran that Netanyahu vehemently opposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Among the most serious risks for Israel would be a shift in Washington's posture at the United Nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The United States has long stood in the way of Palestinian efforts to get a U.N. resolution recognizing its statehood, including threatening to use its veto, and has protected Israel from efforts to isolate it internationally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Earnest left the door open to the possibility that Washington might be less diligent about shielding Israel diplomatically in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Steps that the United States has taken at the United Nations had been predicated on this idea that the two-state solution is the best outcome," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Now our ally in these talks has said that they are no longer committed to that solution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Netanyahu touched off the diplomatic storm with his comments on the eve of Tuesday's election that he would not allow a Palestinian state, widely seen as intended to mobilize his right-wing base when his electoral hopes were flagging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The goal of Palestinian statehood is a central principle of U.S. diplomacy going back decades.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But Obama's previous peace efforts have failed and prospects for renewed diplomacy were already low.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>U.S. officials scolded Netanyahu not only for abandoning his commitment to a Palestinian state but also for his election-day accusation that left-wingers were working to get Israel's minority Arab voters out "in droves" to sway the election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It's a pretty cynical tactic," Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The White House official said in the phone call Obama "also discussed Prime Minister Netanyahu's comments about Israeli Arabs" but gave no details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Netanyahu denied he had been trying to suppress the votes of Arab citizens or that his comments were racist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Even as he backed away from his pre-election statement rejecting Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu made clear that he believed for now political and security conditions were not amenable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"I don't want a one-state solution. I want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution. But for that, circumstances have to change," he told MSNBC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Netanyahu's frosty relations with Obama worsened when he accepted a Republican invitation to speak to Congress two weeks before the Israeli election, a move assailed by Democratic leaders as an insult to the presidency and a breach of protocol.</td></tr>

<h3>Barack Obama mandates a 40 percent cut in government emitted greenhouse gases</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Obama's executive order also directs the government to ramp up use of renewable energy sources to 30 percent of the federal government's consumption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The White House said U.S. taxpayers could save up to $18 billion in electricity costs by reducing greenhouse gases 40 percent over the next decade, compared to 2008 levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'These are ambitious goals, but we know they're achievable goals,' Obama said at the Energy Department on Thursday, where he toured a rooftop solar panel installation after signing the executive order at the White House.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Major companies that sell to the federal government like GE, HP, Northrup Grumman and Honeywell will also announce voluntary commitments to cut their own emissions of the heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming, the White House said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>IBM, for example, said it will cut its energy consumption 35 percent by 2020 and buy at least 20 percent of its power from renewably sources by that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The operator of an estimated 360,000 buildings and 650,000 vehicles, the federal government is the country's single largest energy consumer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Department of Defense alone is responsible for roughly half of that consumption, a senior administration official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>All told, the government pollution cuts along with industry contributions will have the effect of keeping 26 million metric tons of greenhouse gases out of the air by 2025, or the equivalent of what about 5.5 million cars would pump out through their tailpipes in an average year, the White House said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Obama, told reporters that the president's mandate is a 'triple win' for the environment, the economy, and the taxpayer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Yet it was unclear exactly how either the government or private companies planned to meet its targets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While at the Energy Department, Obama also discussed the new emissions targets at a roundtable with federal suppliers that do more than $1 billion per year in business with the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The U.S. government is responsible for only a small portion of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, but the Obama administration is hoping that taking aggressive steps at home will increase the political pressure on other countries to do the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>'Certainly our hope is that we are laying forth template that other countries could also learn from and look at as well,' Deese noted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Climate change was reportedly a topic of discussion at the president's Oval Office meeting on Thursday afternoon with Prince Charles, who is next in line for the throne in Britain, and the Duchess of Cornwall Camilla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A major global climate treaty, in the works for years, is supposed to be finalized in December at a summit in Paris, but most countries have yet to announce what their national contributions to the pact will be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Earlier this month the European Union unveiled its contribution, vowing to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent by 2030, compared to 1990.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The U.S. has yet to announce its contribution to the treaty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But in a bid to build momentum last year, Obama set a U.S. goal to cut emissions up to 28 percent by 2025 - compared to 2005 levels - in a joint announcement with China that boosted hopes that an aggressive climate treaty may come to fruition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The president hasn't fully explained how he'll meet that goal, but his aides have suggested that unprecedented pollution limits he's imposing on power plants will get the U.S. much of the way there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Obama's executive order directs the federal government to cut energy use in federal buildings 2.5 percent every year between 2015 and 2025 and reduce the amount of water used in federal buildings 2 percent every year through 2025.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It also advises federal agencies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from government-owned vehicles by 30 percent per mile by 2025, compared to the levels in 2014, and put more hybrid and zero-emission vehicles in their fleets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Additionally, it seeks to ensure federal agencies are getting 25 percent of their energy - both heat and electricity - from clean sources by 2025.</td></tr>
