<h3>After Iraqi forces take Tikrit, a wave of looting and lynching</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A member from the Iraqi security forces beats an Islamic State insurgent, who was captured in Tikrit, April 1, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Smoke rises from burning shops in Tikrit April 2, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Members of Hashid Shaabi forces ride in a vehicle as smoke rises in shops at al-Qadisiya neighborhood, north of Tikrit April 3, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>TIKRIT, Iraq (Reuters) - On April 1, the city of Tikrit was liberated from the extremist group Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Shi'ite-led central government and allied militias, after a month-long battle, had expelled the barbarous Sunni radicals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Then, some of the liberators took revenge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Near the charred, bullet-scarred government headquarters, two federal policemen flanked a suspected Islamic State fighter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Urged on by a furious mob, the two officers took out knives and repeatedly stabbed the man in the neck and slit his throat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The killing was witnessed by two Reuters correspondents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Iraqi security forces launch a rocket towards Islamic State militants during clashes at a frontline in Tikrit March 28, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Four Iraqi soldiers were killed in street fighting with Islamic State militants in Tikrit overnight as they advanced slowly into the city, a Sunni jihadist bastion, in the wake of coalition air strikes, a security official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The incident is now under investigation, interior ministry spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Since its recapture two days ago, the Sunni city of Tikrit has been the scene of violence and looting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In addition to the killing of the extremist combatant, Reuters correspondents also saw a convoy of Shi'ite paramilitary fighters - the government's partners in liberating the city - drag a corpse through the streets behind their car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Local officials said the mayhem continues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Two security officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday that dozens of homes had been torched in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They added that they had witnessed the looting of stores by Shi'ite militiamen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Later Friday, Ahmed al-Kraim, head of the Salahuddin Provincial Council, told Reuters that mobs had burned down "hundreds of houses" and looted shops over the past two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Government security forces, he said, were afraid to confront the mobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Kraim said he left the city late Friday afternoon because the situation was spinning out of control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"Our city was burnt in front of our eyes. We can't control what is going on," Kraim said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It wasn't supposed to be this way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Islamic State, an Al Qaeda offshoot that arose from the chaos in Iraq and Syria, slaughtered thousands and seized much of northern and central Iraq last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The government offensive was meant not only to dislodge the group but also to transcend the fundamental divide in fractured Iraq: the enmity between the now-ruling Shi'ite majority and the country's formerly dominant Sunni minority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Officials close to Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, a moderate Shi'ite, had described the Tikrit campaign as a chance to demonstrate his government's independence from one source of its power: Iraqi Shi'ite militias backed by Shi'ite Iran and advised by Iranian military officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sunnis deeply mistrust and fear these paramilitaries, accusing them of summary executions and vandalism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But Abadi has had to rely on the Shi'ite militias on the battlefield, as Iraq's regular military deserted en masse last summer in the Islamic State onslaught.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The militia groups spearheaded the start of the Tikrit assault in early March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But after two weeks of fighting, Abadi enforced a pause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Asserting his power over the Shi'ite militias, he called in U.S. airstrikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Now, the looting and violence in Tikrit threaten to tarnish Abadi's victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It risks signaling to Sunni Iraqis that the central government is weak and not trustworthy enough to recapture other territory held by Islamic State, including the much larger city of Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Tikrit, hometown of the late dictator Saddam Hussein, is in the Sunni heartland of Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>At stake is much more than future votes: Islamic State's rapid conquests in 2014 were made possible by support from Sunni tribal forces and ordinary citizens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>They were convinced that the government - under Abadi's predecessor, Nuri al-Maliki - viewed their community as terrorists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>If Sunnis dislike what they see in Tikrit, they may not back the government's efforts against Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>On Friday, the government sought to assure all sides that it will enforce order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Abadi issued a statement calling on the security forces to arrest anyone breaking the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Asked to comment on the scenes witnessed by Reuters, his spokesman Rafid Jaboori said he would not address individual incidents but said: "People's lives and property are priorities, whether in this operation or in the overall military effort to liberate the rest of Iraq."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A member from the Iraqi security forces beats an Islamic State insurgent, who was captured in Tikrit April 1, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Sunni lawmakers who visited Tikrit complained that events have spun out of control since the security forces and militias retook the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Parliamentarian Mutashar al-Samarrai credited the government with orchestrating a smooth entrance into Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>But he said that some Shi'ite paramilitary factions had exploited the situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"I believe this happened on purpose to disrupt the government's achievement in Tikrit," Samarrai said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"This is a struggle between the (paramilitaries) and the government for control."</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Neighborhoods entered by the Iraqi forces and Shi'ite paramilitaries have been burnt, including parts of neighboring Dour and Auja, the birthplace of Saddam Hussein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Security forces blame Islamic State for rigging houses with explosives, while Sunnis suspect the Shi'ite militias and the army and police of deliberately torching their homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Looting has also been a problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Shi'ite paramilitary fighters in pickup trucks raced through the city carrying goods that appeared to have been looted from homes and government offices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>The vehicles were crammed with refrigerators, air conditioners, computer printers, and furniture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>A young militia fighter rode on a red bicycle, gleefully shouting: "I always dreamed of having a bike like this as a kid."</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Brigadier General Maan, the main spokesman for the government forces, said police were stopping vehicles that appeared to have stolen items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>"We are doing our best to impose the law."</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Passions were running high among the Shi'ite militia groups before the assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Islamic State beheaded people and carried out other atrocities in the lands it conquered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>In particular, the militias wanted revenge for Islamic State's killing in June of hundreds of Iraqi soldiers captured from Camp Speicher, a base near Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>It was an event that came to symbolize the Sunni jihadists' barbarism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Despite Baghdad's efforts to rein in the paramilitaries, the fingerprints of the Shi'ite militias - and of Iran itself - were all over the operation's final hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>On Wednesday, as Tikrit fell, militiamen were racing to stencil their names on houses in order to take credit for the victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>An Iranian fighter, with a Kalashnikov rifle slung over his shoulder and a picture of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pinned to his chest, bragging about Tehran's role in the campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>"I am proud to participate in the battle to liberate Tikrit," said the man, who called himself Sheik Dawood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>"Iran and Iraq are one state now."</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>On the edge of Tikrit in the hours after the city's fall, a Shi'ite paramilitary group drove in a convoy past several police cars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>The militiamen had strung the corpse of a suspected Islamic State fighter from the back of a white Toyota pickup truck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>The cable dragging the man snapped, and the vehicle stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>The men got out to retie the bullet-riddled corpse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>As they fastened the cable tighter to the body, a song about their victory over Islamic State played on the truck's stereo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Then they sped off, the corpse kicking up a cloud of dust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>The policemen standing nearby did nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>On Wednesday afternoon, Reuters saw two suspected Islamic State detainees - identified as an Egyptian and a Sudanese national - in a room in a government building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>The Egyptian and the Sudanese were then taken outside by police intelligence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Word spread that the two suspected Islamic State prisoners were being escorted out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Federal policemen, who had lost an officer named Colonel Imad the previous day in a bombing, flocked around the detainees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>The interior ministry spokesman, Brigadier Maan, said the Egyptian had stabbed an Iraqi police officer, which explains the anger against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Reuters couldn't verify that claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>The two prisoners were put in the back of a pickup truck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>As the vehicle tried to leave, the crowd blocked it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>The federal policemen started shouting to the intelligence officers: Hand over the men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>The intelligence officers tried to shield the prisoners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>One pulled a sidearm as the federal police began swinging their fists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>The mob was screaming: "We want to avenge our Lieutenant Colonel."</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Shi'ite paramilitary men swarmed the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>The street filled with more than 20 federal police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Gunfire erupted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Bullets ricocheted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>At least one of the Shi'ite fighters was wounded, and began bleeding from the leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>The pickup truck tried to back up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>People in the mob grabbed one of the prisoners from the truck, the Egyptian, and pulled him out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>The Egyptian sat silently at the feet of two big policemen in their twenties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>His eyes filled with fear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>He was surrounded by a few dozen people, a mix of federal police and Shi'ite militiamen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>"He is Daesh, and we should take revenge for Colonel Imad," the two federal police officers yelled, using a derogatory Arabic term for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>One of the policemen held a black-handled knife with a four-to-five-inch blade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>The other gripped a folding knife, with a three-inch blade and a brown handle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>They waved their knives in the air, to cheers from the crowd, and chanted: "We will slaughter him. We will take revenge for Colonel Imad. We will slaughter him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>The policemen laid the Egyptian's head over the curb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>Then one of the police pushed the other out of the way and he swung his whole body down, landing the knife into the Egyptian's neck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>The cop lifted the knife and thrust the blade in the Egyptian's neck a second time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Blood gushed out, staining the boots of the cheering onlookers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>The killer started to saw through the neck, but it was slow-going.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>He lifted the blade again and slammed it into the Egyptian's neck another four times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Then he sawed back and forth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Their fellow policemen chanted: "We took revenge for Colonel Imad."</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>The killer lifted himself up the street pole next to the dying man so he could address his comrades: "Colonel Imad was a brave man. Colonel Imad didn't deserve to die at the hands of dirty Daesh. This is a message to Colonel Imad's family don't be sad, raise your heads."</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>Then he shouted: "Let's tie the body to the pole so everyone can see. Bring a cable. Bring a cable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>His friend with the folding knife kept trying to stab the Egyptian, with no success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>He cried out: "I need a sharp knife. I want to behead this dirty Daesh."</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>Finally the men found a cable, fastened it to the dead man's feet and dangled him from the pole.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>One policeman grew upset at the spectacle and shouted: "There are dozens of media here. This is not the suitable time. Why do you want to embarrass us?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>The mob ignored him and continued trying to hoist the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>White bone stuck out from his slashed neck, his head flopped from side to side, and the blood continued to gush forth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>(Reported by Reuters correspondents in Tikrit whose names have been withheld for security reasons, and by Ned Parker in Baghdad. Written by Ned Parker. Edited by Michael Williams.)</td></tr>
