<h3>Ryanair forced to admit it is not considering trans-Atlantic flights after all</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>"European consumers want lower cost travel to the USA and the same for Americans coming to Europe. We see it as a logical development in the European market," a spokesman said on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"The business plan is there but it's dependent on attaining viable long haul aircraft and we estimate that's 4 to 5 years away."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, has long spoken about his desire for Ryanair to carry passengers across the Atlantic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, the company has struggled to find a way to make it pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Other companies have learned the hard way of launching rock-bottom fares to the States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Freddie Laker launched low-cost flights to the US in 1977, only for Laker Airways to go bust five years later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Norwegian Airlines started offering budget tickets between London and New York last summer, though the achievement was marred by the carrier falling to an annual loss for the first time in eight years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Others to have tried cheap flights to the States include Zoom Airlines, which ceased operations in 2008, and Icelandic carrier Wow Air, which will later this year launch 99 tickets from London Gatwick to two US cities with a stopover in Reykjavik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Ryanair is Europe's largest budget carrier with 86.4m passengers last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>It has embarked on an ambitious plan to increase its traffic to 150m passengers by 2024 and Mr O'Leary is focusing on a cuddly 'new Ryanair experience'.</td></tr>

<h3>Yahoo Inc leaving China in new cost-cutting move, affecting as many as 300 jobs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The company said Thursday the Beijing office's functions would be consolidated in other locations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It gave no details of how many people would lose their jobs but said they would be "treated with respect and fairness."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Sunnyvale, California-based company has cut jobs elsewhere in a sweeping corporate overhaul as it tries to catch up with Internet users who have shifted to using smartphones and tablets instead of laptop and desktop computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Yahoo had about 12,500 workers worldwide at the end of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While the company didn't say how many would be affected in China, it employed 200 to 300 people there, a person with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Yahoo turned over control of its China operations to its partner Alibaba Group in 2005 as part of a corporate tie-up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Yahoo stopped offering services in China in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Yahoo's profit for the quarter ending in December fell 52% from a year earlier while revenue dipped 1%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yahoo is looking for new ways to trim expenses as it comes under pressure from investors, such as Starboard Value LP, who have called for cost-saving measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer said in January the company has focused on efficiency by keeping its employee numbers little changed even as it invested in products and made acquisitions that added staff at the portal, whose revenue growth has stalled since 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"An R&D facility like this is a huge cost, and for a company as weak as Yahoo is now, it doesn't make sense," said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research in Shanghai.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Yahoo doesn't have significance in China. Yahoo can't really recruit top people and Chinese firms are not going to advertise on Yahoo."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>For Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, the exit closes a chapter on a sometimes difficult history in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Executives came under criticism from human-rights activists and U.S. lawmakers after the company turned over information to the Chinese government on journalist Shi Tao, who was later sentenced to 10 years in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Yahoo sold its Chinese operations to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last month, Yahoo cut about 1% of its workforce, or about 125 people, including editorial staff in Canada.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The company also closed its office in Amman, Jordan, and eliminated about 400 positions at its site in Bangalore, India, in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Yahoo shares have gained 13% in the past year, buoyed in part by the company's stake of about 15% in Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In January, Mayer unveiled plans for Yahoo to spin off its Alibaba holdings, which are valued at more than US$32 billion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The closing of the China office wasn't related to any government concerns, said the person familiar with the plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The move was reported earlier by the South China Morning Post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Yahoo's move is the latest in a series of retrenchments by U.S. technology companies operating in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Last month, gamemaker Zynga Inc. said it will close its Beijing office, terminating 71 employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Microsoft Corp. said in December it was shutting phone factories in Beijing and Dongguan as part of a consolidation of its Asia manufacturing in Vietnam.</td></tr>
