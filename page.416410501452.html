<h3>Egypt's ousted president Morsi jailed for 20 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cairo (AFP) - An Egyptian court Tuesday sentenced ousted president Mohamed Morsi to 20 years in prison for abuses against protesters but acquitted the Islamist leader of charges carrying a possible death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Morsi was convicted of ordering the arrest and torture of demonstrators involved in clashes in 2012 when he was president, in a verdict Amnesty International denounced as a "travesty of justice".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fourteen others were convicted of the same charges, with most also sentenced by the Cairo court to 20 years in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It acquitted the defendants of inciting murder in connection with the deaths of a journalist and two protesters during the December 5, 2012 clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Morsi, dressed in a white prison uniform and standing in a soundproof cage, raised his fists when the verdict was announced, an AFP correspondent reported from the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Defence lawyers said they would appeal the convictions while rights groups voiced alarm at the ruling, the first in a series of trials Morsi is facing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This verdict shatters any remaining illusion of independence and impartiality in Egypt's criminal justice system," said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty's deputy Middle East and North Africa director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She called for a full retrial or the ex-president's release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Egypt's first freely elected leader, Morsi came to power following the 2011 ouster of longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But after just a year in power, Morsi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass street protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Other Brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and Tuesday's decision to acquit Morsi on the incitement to murder charge left some surprised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"We were expecting them to be convicted of murder," Ramy Ghanem, a lawyer for an anti-Morsi protester who was wounded in the clashes, told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"But the sentences are not bad. We were expecting life in prison, but then 20 years is not very different," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called "unprecedented in recent history".</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The Muslim Brotherhood condemned Tuesday's verdict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The illegitimate powers are trying to impose their tyranny through invalid sentences. This oppression will backfire as the revolution and public anger continue," it said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Brotherhood had called for pro-Morsi protests on Tuesday but there were no reports of major rallies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The movement has failed to mobilise supporters for several months following the government crackdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty, including on a charge of spying for foreign powers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Sisi has vowed to "eradicate" the Brotherhood, an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between Mubarak's fall and Morsi's presidential election victory in May 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The authorities designated it a "terrorist group" in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The crackdown has sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups, who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Sisi was elected president in May last year, but he faced no serious challengers and -- in a country where the army has held the reins of power for decades -- his victory dashed the hopes of pro-democracy protesters who ousted Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Sisi's regime is popular among many Egyptians tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But Sisi has been accused of repression and his crackdown has also targeted secular and liberal activists who spearheaded the uprising against Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>In November, a court dropped murder charges against Mubarak in his own trial over the deaths of hundreds of protesters in 2011.</td></tr>
