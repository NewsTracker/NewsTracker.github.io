<h3>Just like home: Dayton beats Providence 66-53 in tournament (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Dyshawn Pierre scored 20 points and the Flyers rode a loud home-state advantage to another NCAA Tournament victory, beating Providence 66-53 Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The 11th-seeded Flyers (27-8) will face Oklahoma on Sunday night in the East Region, with a chance to reach the round of 16 for the second straight season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Sixth-seeded Providence (22-12) could not overcome early foul trouble on Big East player of the year Kris Dunn or a Dayton team buoyed by a legion of fans that made the 80-mile trip to Columbus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''It was powerful,'' Dayton coach Archie Miller said of the support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''Our fans continue to be on front and center stage right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dunn finished with 11 points before fouling out for Providence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>LaDontae Henton, the Big East's leading scorer, had 18 points and 11 rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dayton was playing its fifth game in eight days after reaching the final of the Atlantic 10 Tournament on Sunday in New York, then winning a First Four game against Boise State on its home court Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''We feel fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>We have a great opportunity in front of us now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>We're not focusing on the games we played.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>We're focusing on the game we got left,'' said Pierre, who also had nine rebounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sibert, who made the key late 3 that helped Dayton rally to beat Boise, scored 15 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Flyers have been the busiest team in the country lately, so they might not have minded the 10:53 ET tip-off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Anything to get a little extra rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Though both teams played as if it was past their bedtimes in the first 11 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>With nine minutes left in the first half, Dayton was up 9-5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It didn't help Providence that Dunn picked up two fouls in the first five minutes and took a seat for a while.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Things picked up in the final eight minutes, with Henton and Sibert trading late 3s to send Dayton to the break with a 28-25 lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Dayton stretched its lead to 44-35 with 10:21 left when Kyle Davis and Pierre hit back-to-back 3s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Providence chipped away, but Sibert responded with another 3 to make it 47-41 with 6:08 left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Flyers fan decked out in red packed Nationwide Arena and had ''Let's Go Flyers!'' ringing through the rafters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''It was like a home game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>We had a great crowd again - and we needed it,'' Sibert said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Providence coach Ed Cooley said on Thursday he didn't mind playing a virtual road game, and that's what he got.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Providence shot seven free throws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Dayton shot 30.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>''It was a neutral site,'' Cooley said, trying to avoid making any excuse for his team's sloppy play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The place rocked when Pierre swished another 3 with 4:28 left to make it 50-42.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It is doubtful Ohio State would have had any more of an advantage in Columbus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Then Cooley got hit with a technical during a timeout, after his chair fell over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Providence assistants pleaded with officials that it was a harmless accident, but they couldn't talk Cooley out of the T.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Cooley said he was trying to fire up his team and he didn't even notice the chair hit the hardwood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>''But I'm just trying to coach my team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>That's what that was about,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Officials declined to speak directly to a pool reporter but through Northeastern athletic director Peter Roby, who was acting as a spokesman, they said Cooley threw the chair out of the huddle and it precipitated a call for unsportsmanlike conduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>NCAA coordinator of officials John Adams released a statement supporting the call and citing, Rule 10, Section 3, Article 2 on bench personnel committing unsportsmanlike acts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Pierre put it away with 1:59 left, spinning free inside, getting fouled and letting out a scream before completing the three-point play to make it 56-42.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Coach Archie Miller, the brother of Arizona coach Sean Miller, led the Flyers to the Elite Eight last year and is now 5-1 in NCAA tournament games - all as an 11 seed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>... Henton said Providence's rough starts had nothing to do with the late tip-off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''Both teams had to suit up at the same time,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Dayton moves on to face the third-seeded Sooners in what will be its sixth game in 10 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Providence is done after its first NCAA Tournament game for the second straight season.</td></tr>
