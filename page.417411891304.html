<h3>Ukraine names Georgia's Saakashvili as governor of Black Sea hotspot</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KIEV, May 31 (Reuters) - Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko has appointed former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to be governor of Ukraine's southern Odessa region, in a surprise move that is certain to raise hackles in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>President Poroshenko made the announcement on Saturday, standing alongside Saakashvili at a ceremony in Odessa, where he described him as "a great friend of Ukraine".</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He granted Saakashvili Ukrainian citizenship to facilitate the move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The security of the Black Sea city of Odessa and its surrounding region has become increasingly worrisome for Ukrainians since a separatist conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine following Russia's annexation of Crimea further along the coast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Saakashvili replaces Ihor Palytsia, a businessman who was appointed governor in May last year after more than 40 people, most of them pro-Russian sympathisers, died in a fire in the port city during a confrontation with pro-Western demonstrators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Poroshenko, who is pursuing a course of European integration to take his country out of the Russian orbit, has appointed several non-Ukrainian nationals to government posts including the finance ministry where U.S.-born Natalia Yaresko has taken over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But this is the first non Ukrainian by birth to be named to head what is in effect a provincial government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Saakashvili is widely credited with carrying out radical reforms in Georgia and cracking down on corruption during his term in office from 2004-2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the present Georgian leadership has accused him of abuse of power and has asked for his extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He denies any wrongdoing and says charges against him are politically motivated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Like Poroshenko, Saakashvili, whose country fought a brief war with Russia in August 2008, is a strong proponent of NATO and European Union membership for his native Georgia and for Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His appointment drew immediate derision in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev tweeted: "Saakashvili - head of Odessa region. The Chapiteau show goes on. Sad Ukraine...".</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The 'chapiteau show' is a Russia way of referring to circus routines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Poroshenko expressed confidence that Saaksahvili would bring discipline and carry out much-needed reforms in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The people of Odessa should soon feel that their living standards have been raised," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Separately in Ukraine, Kiev's military reported on Sunday that one serviceman had been killed and another wounded in attacks by separatists in the past 24 hours which violated a February ceasefire.</td></tr>
