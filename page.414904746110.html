<h3>Liberia to end Ebola curfew, open land border crossings</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The new orders from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, which take effect Sunday, offer another sign that normal life is resuming in the West African nation as officials work toward eradicating the disease entirely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Once the center of the worst Ebola outbreak in history, Liberia has recorded more than 9,000 confirmed, suspected and probable cases and 3,900 deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, the most recent update from the World Health Organization reported only two cases in the previous week, and schools began reopening earlier this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Friday's statement said Sirleaf made her decision about the curfew and borders "on the advice of the National Security Council of Liberia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The curfew was imposed last August when the epidemic was raging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It originally lasted from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., though officials later pushed the start time back to midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The statement said Sirleaf had ordered that "the country's main borders" be opened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That includes the borders with Sierra Leone and Guinea, but it wasn't immediately clear if the border with Ivory Coast would be reopened, because Ivory Coast closed its borders in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sierra Leone recorded 74 new cases in the latest WHO update and transmission remains widespread there, while Guinea recorded 52 cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sirleaf's announcement comes as she prepares to visit the White House next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a statement, the White House said President Barack Obama and Sirleaf would discuss the current Ebola response and the region's economic recovery plans during their Feb. 27 meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The United States is preparing to withdraw most of the nearly 3,000 troops dispatched to West Africa last year to help combat the outbreak.</td></tr>

<h3>Man charged in veteran attack now charged in triple homicide</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police said Friday they have charged 59-year-old Ian Bush in the deaths of a retired judge, his wife and their neighbor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Earlier in the day, Bush was found fit to stand trial in the Dec. 18 attack on Ernest Cote, a D-Day veteran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bush allegedly put a plastic bag over Cote's head while robbing his home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The ruling came after Bush went through a 20-day psychiatric assessment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 2007 triple murder " the three victims were found inside an Ottawa condominium " had stumped police for years until they made a connection following the attack on Cote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Police say there is DNA evidence.</td></tr>
