<h3>Survivor Producer Guilty Of Killing Wife</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bruce Beresford-Redman was sentenced to 12 years in prison by Judge Victor Manuel Echeverria Tun in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The one-time Survivor producer was on vacation at a beach resort in the Mexican city to attempt to repair his marriage after his wife, Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman, had learned he had cheated on her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Also present were the couple's two children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The woman's body was found in a sewer cistern about 75 yards (68 metres) from the hotel room the family were staying in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Beresford-Redman, who is also credited as co-creator and executive producer of MTV's Pimp My Ride, has maintained his innocence throughout the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Burgos family lawyer, Alison Triessl, said: "It has been nearly five years since they lost their beloved sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Not a day goes by that they don't miss her terribly and nothing will bring her back, but they can finally say that she has received the justice she deserved."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The US extradited Beresford-Redman to Mexico in 2012, and the Emmy-nominated producer was ordered to stand trial on a murder charge shortly after his arrival in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Part of the evidence in the case included statements from hotel guests who said they heard loud arguing and cries of distress coming from the couple's room on the night the 42-year-old victim went missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The producer's lawyers maintained the noises came from Beresford-Redman and his children playing loud games throughout the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>When Beresford-Redman reported his wife missing he told police she had failed to return to the hotel after going shopping alone the day before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He argued that there was no forensic evidence proving he had killed his wife and he now plans to launch an appeal.</td></tr>
