<h3>Speech fallout could determine Netanyahu?s fate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a joint meeting of Congress Tuesday in the Capitol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>JERUSALEM - With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing a tough re-election fight in two weeks, the U.S. Congress has handed him an unprecedented boost with its effusive welcome to a message that resonates at home: Iran cannot be trusted as a threshold nuclear state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Which way it goes for Netanyahu may hinge on whether Israel is in some perceptible way punished by the White House for its leader's extraordinary offensive against a U.S. president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If he is seen as having bravely spoken truth to power and escaped consequences, the episode will likely help him at the polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>That could deeply affect the Middle East for years to come on issues far beyond Iran, most notably the conflict with the Palestinians, which some consider even more important than the nature of any future deal on Iran's nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At home and abroad, Netanyahu is seen by many as a leading obstacle to peace with the Palestinians and perhaps the Arab world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And his insistence on continuing Jewish settlement of the occupied West Bank has many fearing Israel will never be able to extricate itself from the territory and its millions of Palestinians - with or without peace - destroying its character as a Jewish state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>For this and other reasons, Netanyahu has found himself at increasingly toxic loggerheads with the country's elites - from the security establishment to academics, journalists, cultural figures and much of the business world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This has been recently compounded by scandals involving his expenses, and rage from middle-class Israelis who struggle to make ends meet and can no longer afford to buy homes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Polls show Netanyahu's Likud party slightly trailing the Zionist Union, which is the main grouping of the center-left opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the highly fractured political environment, it seems plausible that the union's head, Isaac Herzog, may be given a first chance to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat Knesset after the March 17 vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under these circumstances, while Netanyahu's speech was delivered to the U.S. Congress, his primary audience may well have been Israel's voters half a world away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In a comedy show that aired just before the speech, a mock Netanyahu was portrayed filling out U.S. immigration forms on the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Under "reason for visit" he declared: "one or two seats" in parliament.</td></tr>
