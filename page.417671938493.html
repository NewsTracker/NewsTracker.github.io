<h3>Congress considering repeal of meat labeling law</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - House Republicans are hoping to repeal a law requiring country-of-origin labels on packages of meat to avoid costly trade retaliation from Canada and Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The World Trade Organization ruled against the law last month, saying the labels that say where animals were born, raised and slaughtered are discriminatory toward the two U.S. border countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Canada and Mexico have said they will now ask the WTO for permission to raise tariffs on U.S. goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The House on Wednesday began debate on legislation that would repeal the law for beef, pork and poultry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A vote was expected later in the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The labels tell consumers what countries the meat is from: for example, "born in Canada, raised and slaughtered in the United States" or "born, raised and slaughtered in the United States."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The WTO ruled against the labels last year and then denied a U.S. appeal last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Obama administration has already revised the labels once to try to comply with previous WTO rulings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has said it's now up to Congress to change the law to avoid retaliation - such as extra tariffs - from the two neighbor countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The law was initially written at the behest of northern U.S. ranchers who compete with the Canadian cattle industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It also was backed by consumer advocates who say it helps shoppers know where their food comes from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The supporters have called on the U.S. government to negotiate with Canada and Mexico to find labels acceptable to all countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, said a repeal would be premature, adding: "Our people deserve a right to know where their food is produced and where it comes from."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Many in the U.S. meat industry - including meat processors who buy animals from abroad - have called for a repeal of the law, which they have fought for years, including unsuccessfully in federal court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, R-Texas, has backed the meat industry's call for repeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Although some consumers desire (country-of-origin labeling) information, there is no evidence to conclude that this mandatory labeling translates into market-measurable increases in consumer demand for beef, pork or chicken," Conaway said on the House floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The bill would go beyond just the muscle cuts of red meat that were covered under the WTO case, also repealing country-of-origin labeling for poultry, ground beef and ground pork.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The legislation would leave in place country-of-origin labeling requirements for several other commodities, including lamb, venison, seafood, fruits and vegetables and some nuts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Canada and Mexico have opposed the law because it causes their animals to be segregated from those of U.S. origin - a costly process that has forced some U.S. companies to stop buying exports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The two countries have said that if they are allowed by the WTO, they may retaliate against a variety of U.S. products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Their list includes some produce, packaged foods and non-agricultural goods such as mattresses, wooden furniture and jewelry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Congress required the labels in 2002 and 2008 farm laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The original labels were less specific, saying a product was a "product of U.S." or "product of U.S. and Canada."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>WTO rejected those labels in 2012, and USDA tried again with the more detailed labels a year later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The WTO rejected those revised rules last year, and the United States filed one last appeal, rejected in May by the WTO.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>On the Senate side, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas also has said he will move quickly to respond to the WTO ruling, but he has yet to introduce a bill.</td></tr>
