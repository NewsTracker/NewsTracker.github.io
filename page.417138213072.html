<tr><td>3</td><td>"I came to Cannes 50 years ago with a movie called 'Alfie.' 'Alfie' won a prize and I didn't, so I never came back. I'm not going all that way for nothing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In "the poster for the movie it's us two old guys in a swimming pool looking at a beautiful girl with no clothes on and I think that describes 'Youth.' We're just looking at what we lost and what we're never going to get again. And it's very sad. The poster makes me cry."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"She knighted me once ... and I nearly got into trouble because she said ... 'I have a feeling you have been doing what you do for a very long time.' And I almost said: 'And so have you.' Michael, keep your mouth shut - you're about to lose your knighthood."</td></tr>
