<h3>Fast Retailing vows to stop abuses at garment factories</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Japanese fashion chain said Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2015 it will expand monitoring of factories operated by its suppliers following complaints over labor violations and other problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company plans to have a pilot program involving 30 percent of the fabrics used in Uniqlo clothing in place by the end of March, and to expand it to all of its textile suppliers by the end of March 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>TOKYO (AP) - Japanese fashion empire Fast Retailing Co. says it will expand monitoring of its suppliers following complaints over labor violations and other problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Yukihiro Nitta, who is in charge of corporate social responsibility at the fashion giant, said Wednesday the company's oversight would extend to the fabric manufacturers who supply the garment companies that make clothes for Fast Retailing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The company plans to have a pilot program involving 30 percent of the fabrics used in Uniqlo clothing in place by the end of March, and to expand it to all of its textile suppliers by March 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tadashi Yanai, the founder of Fast Retailing, is reported to be the richest man in Japan, with wealth estimated by business magazine Forbes at $17.8 billion as of April 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He has parlayed the men's clothing store his father started in a western Japanese mining town into a global garment empire employing more than 30,400 workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But the company's low-cost, high fashion production model faces is challenged by rising wages in China, obliging it to operate in lower-cost countries such as Cambodia and Bangladesh, where managing conditions at factories could prove more daunting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Yanai has set a goal of generating 5 trillion yen ($42 billion) in annual sales by 2020, seeking to surpass rivals like Gap Inc. and Spain's Inditex SA, which owns the Zara brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The company earlier announced broad plans to tighten controls on working hours and other conditions for workers at factories that are mostly in developing countries such as China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>That followed a report by labor rights groups detailing specific problems at two factories in southern China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Fast Retailing said it has taken specific measures with those suppliers to ensure working hours, air quality, temperatures and other working conditions will meet its standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The company said it also will increase surprise audits of indirect suppliers such as textile makers and conduct training on labor rights for workers and managers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"We believe that respect for human rights and ensuring fair working conditions are top priorities for the entire industry, and not just Fast Retailing," said Nitta, the corporate social responsibility executive.</td></tr>

<h3>Al-Jazeera producer hopes to be cleared in Egypt retrial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Baher Mohammed, 31, was initially sentenced to 10 years before an appeals court ordered a retrial for him and colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Peter Greste.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The three were initially convicted of terrorism-related charges in a trial widely derided as political by rights groups and fellow journalists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Greste, an Australian, was deported home on Feb. 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Fahmy, a dual Egyptian-Canadian national, dropped his Egyptian citizenship at the nudging of Egyptian security officials who told him it was the only way he would benefit from a new law that allows foreigners to be deported during their trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He and Mohammed were released Friday, but must report each day to the local police station until their new trial begins Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I am just optimistic but I decided not to (have) any expectations. I decided to live the present time, to enjoy my limited freedom. I am happy with it," Mohammed said at his home in a Cairo suburb, where he has been reunited with his wife, his three kids, his parents and his Caucasian Shepherd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mohammed learned his wife was pregnant with their third child two weeks after he was arrested at his house in the middle of the night in December 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Security forces shot the dog, then a puppy, as they stormed his house and searched it, confiscating equipment and money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Now his newborn son Haroun is six months old and his dog Gatsby's leg has healed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I missed six months of (Haroun's) life. Can you imagine? And I can't get those six months back," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Only the day before yesterday I started to make him smile and that was amazing. Finally I am building a relationship with him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mohammed said he spent 411 days in three different prisons in Egypt, including a maximum security facility where he had to sleep on a damp cement floor in a cell six and a half feet wide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>During his time behind bars Mohammed put together a nightly variety show of sorts with other inmates that included commentary on current events, reading poetry and singing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>During some of the mock shows he and Fahmy grilled senior Islamist politicians who had been detained after the 2013 military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mohammed said his younger kids, Hazem, 5, and Fairouz, 4, would come with their mother to visit him once a week, after he was removed from the maximum security prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But they never knew their father was imprisoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They always thought he was at work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Every time I try to go open the door, they cry. They think I am leaving, going to work," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>So he hasn't left his family since being released on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Mohammed expressed gratitude at the international campaign by rights groups and fellow journalists calling for his release, saying it gave him strength and had probably played a key role in authorities granting him a new trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>It's a campaign he hopes to join once his own struggle is over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Even if they set me and Fahmy free, freedom of expression will remain behind bars because there are many other Egyptian journalists still behind bars," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"After I saw this amazing unity of the journalist community supporting us and freedom of the press, it is my responsibility to keep this pressure to help immediately call for the release of each single journalist."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There are at least nine other journalists in detention in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Committee to Protect Journalists listed Egypt in 2014 as one of the 10 worst jailers of journalists around the world, along with China, Iran, Turkey and Ethiopia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>One reporter, freelance photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid, has been in detention for over 550 days without charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>His detention was renewed indefinitely on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The initial trial of the Al-Jazeera English reporters opened last February, nearly two months after the three were arrested and charged with aiding Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which is now officially branded a terrorist group and has been the target of a sweeping crackdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Rights groups described the trial as a sham, saying the court produced no evidence to support the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The journalists and their network said they were caught in a political dispute between Egypt and Qatar, which sponsors Al-Jazeera and had been a strong backer of Morsi during his divisive year in power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mohammed said he was hopeful that the new panel of judges would free him and his colleagues based on the appeals court finding that the evidence presented by prosecutors was flawed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"After the first trial I decided to give up any expectations because when ... they don't come true, it harms you inside. So I decided to give up dreaming as well."</td></tr>
