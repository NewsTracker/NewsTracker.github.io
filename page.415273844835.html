<h3>Islamic State militants attack Christian villages in Syria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BEIRUT -- Islamic State militants attacked a string of predominantly Christian villages in northeastern Syria on Saturday, touching off heavy clashes with Kurdish militiamen and their local allies, activists said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The attack began around dawn and targeted at least three villages near the town of Tal Tamr along the Khabur River in Hassakeh province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Islamic State group kidnapped more than 220 Assyrian Christians from the same area last month after overrunning several farming communities on the southern bank of the river.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The fighting Saturday was focused in villages on the northern bank of the river as the militants press to capture Tal Tamr, a strategic crossroads some 35 kilometres from the city of Hassakeh, said Osama Edwards, director of the Assyrian Network for Human Rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The battles are now very intensive, very violent," said Edwards, who is based in Sweden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Tal Tamr is the main goal of the Islamic State, to give them the corridor to the eastern border to Iraq."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the fighting around Tal Tamr, which it said was coming under Islamic State artillery fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Observatory director Rami Abdurrahman says the Islamic State extremists initially made gains before Kurdish fighters backed by local Assyrian militiamen pushed them back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Observatory said at least eight militants were killed in the fighting and an unknown number of Kurds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Assyrians are an indigenous Christian people who trace their roots back to ancient Mesopotamia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Also Saturday, Syrian state media said government airstrikes this week in the central province of Hama killed a local leader of the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It identified the slain militant as Deib Hdeijan al-Otaibi, also known as Abi Ammar al-Jazrawi, and said a convoy of vehicles was also destroyed in the air raids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Observatory director Abdurrahman also said al-Jazrawi had been killed, along with at least 25 other Islamic State fighters.</td></tr>
