<h3>Kirk makes par putt at 18 to win Colonial; Spieth 2nd again (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- As Chris Kirk waited to putt on the 18th green, Jordan Spieth was watching nearby in anticipation of a possible playoff at Colonial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Kirk was also expecting a playoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He just thought it would be with playing partner Brandt Snedeker and not Spieth, the local Masters champion who was within one stroke of Kirk's lead after draining a 20-foot birdie at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>18 when finishing two groups earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In the end, there were no extra holes Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Kirk got the plaid jacket that goes to the winner at Hogan's Alley, and Spieth finished as a runner-up in Texas for the third time this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>After an errant tee shot at the last hole, Kirk made with a clutch 7-foot par putt for his fourth PGA Tour victory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Snedeker's 12-foot birdie try to tie the lead had just slid by the cup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''I had the mentality I was getting ready to get up and make that putt to get into a playoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That was what I thought,'' Kirk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''Close friends with Brandt and play a lot of golf with him, and he doesn't miss very many of those putts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His closing 4-under 66 got Kirk to 12-under 268, a stroke ahead of Snedeker (67), Spieth (65) and Jason Bohn, whose final-round 63 included six birdies in a row on the front nine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Spieth, the 21-year-old Masters champion from Dallas, was making a bid to win the first of consecutive tournaments at home in the North Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Just like the rest of the week, Spieth got a rousing ovation when he got to the 18th green.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It got even wilder after he sank the long birdie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''I wanted to give them something to cheer about,'' Spieth said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Spieth, whose near-birdie at the par-3 16th hole Sunday became a bogey instead, had consecutive runner-up finishes in his home state before winning last month at Augusta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He finished behind fellow Texan Jimmy Walker at San Antonio and lost in a three-man playoff at Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>At Colonial, Spieth made a birdie at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>18 to end the first round with a 64 and in a four-way tie for the lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But he shot 73 in the second round Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The PGA Tour is next at the Byron Nelson Championship in Irving, where Spieth twice made the cut as a teenage amateur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''I can look back at the runner-up finishes this year, and they were normally good weeks the next week, so I can take confidence into that,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>After Kirk hooked his tee shot at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>18 into the left rough, Bohn and Spieth went to the nearby No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>1 tee to hit a few balls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Spieth had made his final putt only a few minutes earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Bohn finished more than an hour before that, when a 28-footer lipped the cup and left him lifting the putter over his head in frustration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''I thought it was in, that's why I started running,'' Bohn said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Kirk hit his approach from 155 yards over the green.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Snedeker, after a similar tee shot, put his in position for a possible birdie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''I wanted to get myself in contention to give myself a chance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>I did that,'' said Snedeker, whose six birdies all came in the first 11 holes, when he also had two bogeys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>After Saturday's best round with a 65, Kirk started the final round with an eagle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>His only bogey came after hitting his drive at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>7 into the rough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The $1.17 million check will be plenty to cover the cost of the new home he is buying close to the University of Georgia, where as a senior in 2007 he won the Hogan Award given by Colonial to the nation's top college player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Kevin Na, the outright leader after the second and third rounds, shot 72 and finished in an eight-way tie for 10th at 9 under.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He was among the quartet tied for the first-round lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A 54-hole leader hasn't won Colonial since Phil Mickelson in 2008.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>''The back nine, I gave myself some chance to make birdie, and I just made nothing,'' Na said.</td></tr>
