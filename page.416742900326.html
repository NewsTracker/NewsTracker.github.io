<h3>Israel's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman snubs Netanyahu coalition invite</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tel Aviv, Israel: Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced on Monday that he will not join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, dealing a blow to the incumbent's emerging coalition in the 11th hour of negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We are going to serve the people from the opposition," he said of his six-seat hardline right-wing Israel Beiteinu party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Defying predictions, Mr Netanyahu's right-wing, nationalist Likud won 30 seats in the March 17 election, paving the way for him to serve a fourth term in office as premier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The incumbent must present his government by midnight on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Lieberman's ultra-nationalist Beiteinu has long been considered a natural ally for Mr Netanyahu's Likud party in coalition negotiations, but Mr Lieberman's rejection means Mr Netanyahu may be reduced to a slim majority of 61 seats in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Lieberman told reporters in Jerusalem that he will also resign from his post as foreign minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Netanyahu's Likud party signed its first two coalition agreements on Wednesday last week, with Kulanu and United Torah Judaism (UTJ).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Lieberman cited promises made in those agreements as grounds for not joining the coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The coalition Mr Netanyahu was building with two ultra-Orthodox parties, another right-wing party and the centre-right Kulanu party of finance minister-designate Moshe Kahlon "is not to our taste, to say the least", Mr Lieberman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"This government has no intention of uprooting Hamas," he said of the Islamist Palestinian movement in de facto control of the Gaza Strip, mentioning one reason of his dissatisfaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The next Netanyahu government would not be a nationalist one, "but the personification of opportunism", he charged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>According to recent local media reports, Mr Lieberman holds a grudge against Mr Netanyahu, blaming him for an ongoing police investigation into allegations of corruption by senior members of his party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Likud is also negotiating with another ultra-Orthodox party, Shas (seven seats) and with the pro-settler, right-wing Jewish Home (eight seats).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Netanyahu still has a good chance of presenting his fourth government by the deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But if he fails, President Reuven Rivlin can appoint another lawmaker to the task of forming a government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>That would then likely be Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As part of the agreement signed last week with UTJ, a social reform program introduced with much fanfare during the previous government, will be cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The program had included criminal sanctions for ultra-Orthodox Torah students who refuse to report for compulsory military service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>It had also included a cancellation of other privileges and financial benefits for the ultra-Orthodox population in Israel.</td></tr>
