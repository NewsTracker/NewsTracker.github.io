<h3>Blue Jays bats pound Orioles pitching</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Blue Jays catcher Dioner Navarro hits a two-run double during first inning MLB action against the Orioles in Baltimore on Friday, April 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>BALTIMORE - It was a dark and gloomy afternoon on the shores of Chesapeake Bay Friday, matching perfectly the mood that the Blue Jays imposed on the Baltimore baseball scene in the Orioles' home opener.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Blue Jays offence that didn't operate at anywhere near full throttle in winning two of three at Yankee Stadium earlier in the week, took Maryland by storm, pounding out 16 hits in a relentless 12-5 drubbing of the Orioles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Every Blue Jay starter save for Edwin Encarnacion had a hit in the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Jose Reyes and Jose Bautista each had three hits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>For Bautista, who came into the game hitless in his first three games, he had a double, two singles, a walk and scored four times before leaving the game in the seventh inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Josh Donaldson and Dioner Navarro each drove in three runs as the Jays pounded out seven doubles and seven singles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This was all a pleasant little gift for starter Mark Buehrle who looked like he might have been vulnerable, especially in the erly part of the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>As usual, he steadied himself to toss six innings, allowing just two runs on eight hits and two walks for his first win of the year.</td></tr>
