<h3>Egypt police raid radio station, detain rights advocate</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - The head of an Egyptian human rights organization said Saturday he is being held in a central Cairo police station following a police raid on the group's online radio station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ahmed Samih, director of the Andalus Institute for Tolerance and Anti-Violence Studies, says police told him he is under investigation for broadcasting without a license on the web radio platform Horytna.</td></tr>
