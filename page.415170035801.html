<h3>Egypt court ruling halts parliamentary election: judicial sources</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt has been without a parliament since June 2012, when a court dissolved the democratically elected main chamber, reversing a major accomplishment of the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>This delay prolongs a period in which President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has wielded sole legislative authority and slows Egypt's progress towards democracy since its first freely elected president was ousted by the army in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The decision by Egypt's Administrative Court came as expected after a ruling on Sunday by the Supreme Constitutional Court against an article on voting districts in an election law which heralded a likely delay to the poll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The first phase of voting was due to begin on March 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The spokesman for the High Election Committee, which said on Sunday it was working on a new timetable, told Reuters on Tuesday a new date would be set after the law had been amended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sisi directed his government to change the law within one month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Analysts say it could be several months before elections were held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>According to one expert, Sunday's ruling requires the government to merge or create new voting districts so that each contains an equal number of voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"If we assume the legal committee finishes this work within one month, a new period for nominations will have to be opened, which will delay us about three months," Hassan Nafaa, a professor of political science at Cairo University, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The election is the final step in a political road map the army announced in July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Egypt's leaders say the election shows their commitment to democracy but critics say Sisi, who as army chief toppled his predecessor, has undermined freedoms gained after the Arab Spring revolt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The final result is the same: no parliament, and the continuation of the executive enjoying legislative authority without any checks or balances," wrote H.A. Hellyer, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, following Sunday's ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Egypt is trying to burnish its image in the run-up to an investors' summit later this month which the government sees as key to turning around an economy battered by four years of political turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ahmed Imam, member of the opposition Strong Egypt party which had announced it would boycott the election because it lacked credibility given a clampdown on political freedoms, said changes to the voting districts alone would not result in a fairer election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Imam said that in order for the elections to be fair, no party should be excluded from running, the state should be neutral throughout and party lists, rather than individual candidates, should take precedence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Without these basic changes, whether the election is held now, a month or three months from now, the situation for us won't have changed."</td></tr>

<h3>Volcano Villarrica erupts in southern Chile, villages evacuated</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The volcano, located near the popular tourist resort of Pucon around 750 km (460 miles) south of the capital Santiago, is one of South America's most active.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It last erupted in 2000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>A column of ash and rock particles shot up to 3 km (nearly 2 miles) into the sky at around 3 a.m. (0600 GMT).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>However, the initial violent eruption was short-lived, and geologists said a major lava flow was unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Over 4,000 people were evacuated overnight as a preventive measure, said Interior Minister Rodrigo Penailillo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Most have since returned to their homes, but the government said an exclusion zone would remain in place until Wednesday for a 10km radius around the mountain, affecting around 400 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Villarica volcano erupts near Pucon, Chile, early Tuesday, March 3, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ash from the volcano was well under the flight paths used by commercial airliners, and flights were unaffected, said Juan Carlos Rojas, air transit head at the government's civil aeronautics division.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Chilean President Michelle Bachelet traveled to the affected region and pledged money to help farmers, already hit by drought after one of the driest winters since records began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The area relies largely on agriculture, paper production and tourism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mines in the top copper exporter are mostly located far to the north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Chile, situated on the so-called Pacific Rim of Fire, has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In 2011, the eruption of Puyehue sent an ash cloud into the atmosphere that disrupted flights in neighboring Argentina for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Villarrica national park in the Los Rios region of Chile is a scenic area of lakes, temperate rainforest and volcanoes that is one of Chile's top tourist attractions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Pucon serves as a center for hotels and adventure tourism, including dozens who normally climb snowcapped Villarrica every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But most tourists had left by Tuesday morning and there were few people around, said British holidaymaker Edward Reilley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The volcano is quiet now, very calm. You wouldn't know anything had happened," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Locals didn't seem worried, he added.</td></tr>
