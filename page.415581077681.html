<h3>Yahoo bets on TV-style comedies to grow its video business</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Mayer, on the job for 18 months after leaving Google, had just fired chief operating officer Henrique de Castro, whose purview had included Yahoo Screen, the digital-video service with a potpourri of content including Saturday Night Live"clips and short-form original comedies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company's U.S. video audience at that point was at 44.9 million unique monthly desktop users, up 2.7% from the year before, according to comScore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It wasn't exactly languishing -- but Wall Street was champing at the bit for Yahoo to show growth in the fast-growing video sector, as overall ad revenue continued to stagnate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>So Mayer turned to chief marketing officer Kathy Savitt, putting her in charge of all media, including the company's video strategy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Together, they came up with a plan: Go bigger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Instead of bite-size, webisodic scripted material, they decided Yahoo needed to get into TV-style shows -- with budgets in the high six figures per episode, according to estimates -- to attract more viewers and ad dollars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Last spring, the company ordered two half-hour comedies, Sin City Saints, about a fictional NBA team in Las Vegas, from Mike Tollin (Smallville, One Tree Hill) and Mandalay Sports Media; and Other Space, a spoof on the sci-fi genre from Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Freaks & Geeks).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It unveiled them with fanfare in New York to a Madison Avenue crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Then in June, Yahoo announced it was rescuing Community, cut by NBC after five seasons, for at least one more run online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>(Unfortunately, the episodes are not currently available in Canada.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Savitt says that Yahoo selected premium projects from targeted storytellers to anchor the new strategy: "We thought they could drive big audiences," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While Community's ratings had made it a dicey broadcast proposition, its core of devoted fans seems to fit Yahoo's plan perfectly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>How perfectly will be determined this week, but it won't be flying solo for long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Sin City Saints debuts March 23, with Other Space touching down a few weeks later, on April 14.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The original shows are one of the three central planks in Yahoo's video push.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The others are live programming -- chiefly comprised of daily concert webcasts through a pact with Live Nation Entertainment that kicked off last summer -- and targeted video series tied to Yahoo's personality-driven digital magazine sites, which cover topics including news, food, technology, travel and beauty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Katie Couric, Mayer's splashy hire as Yahoo global news anchor, with a reported US$5 million annual salary, has been a standout in delivering strong video numbers, according to the company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Couric, who exited her ABC-syndicated talk show Katie in June, has generated more than 65 million video views to date with live and on-demand interviews, with subjects ranging from Larry David to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>In the fourth quarter of 2014, Couric drew 32 million views, and is averaging more than 1 million live streams per episode -- with some generating 3-4 million each, according to Yahoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The live concerts, Couric webcasts and other events "are big, television-trouncing events for us," Savitt says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But in aggregate, Yahoo's numbers are smaller than the total views of top YouTube channels, given the companies' differing content strategies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Overall, YouTube had 155.9 million unique monthly U.S. desktop video users in January 2015, which was 2.6 times Yahoo's audience of 60.4 million, according to comScore.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>At the channel level, look at YouTube's PewDiePie: The Swedish gamer, with a following of 35.4 million users on the Google-owned site, garners more than 300 million views monthly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Meanwhile, Disney's Maker Studios multichannel network generates some 11 billion views per month on YouTube.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>On the news front, daily news show The Young Turks generates 65 million views from 27.5 million unique viewers every single month on YouTube -- more than Couric's numbers, as they stand today -- even though individual episodes draw fewer than 100,000 views apiece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Rounding out the Yahoo Screen menu is licensed content from Broadway Video's SNL, Comedy Central, Vevo, BuzzFeed, Conde Nast, Warner Music Group and the NFL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>And last week, ABC and Yahoo said they were expanding their partnership to include a daily segment on Good Morning America built around Yahoo personalities; broader distribution of clips from ABC shows; and special programming contributed by Couric.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Exactly how Community and the rest of Yahoo's revamped video programming schedule will contribute to the bottom line -- if at all -- remains to be seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In any case, analysts say Yahoo had no choice but to move forward more decisively in the video space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"They need to raise the bar in terms of what they're spending on video," Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"They've said, 'Yeah, we need more content. Yeah, we hired Katie Couric' ... but it still hasn't produced anything meaningful. They need a portfolio that's at least B+ programming."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Financially, Yahoo has been treading water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In the fourth quarter of 2014, total revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs was $1.18 billion, flat from the year earlier and slightly below Wall Street expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Adjusted earnings of $409 million were down 4% from the year prior, but higher than analyst estimates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Yahoo's display-ad pricing has been down 20% or more for three straight quarters, according to Pyykkonen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The company will be under even more pressure to show investors growth after it is fully divested from Alibaba Group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Yahoo plans to sell its 15.4% remaining stake in Alibaba, valued at about $40 billion, in the fourth quarter of 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It originally invested $1 billion in the Chinese e-commerce company in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>After it unloads Alibaba stock, which has represented a big portion of Yahoo's market value, the metrics of profit and loss will become more urgent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"The time is soon coming where operating results will matter once again," Pivotal Research senior analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a January research note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But even with $10.2 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of 2014, Yahoo has been cautious about its expansion into original online video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Its biggest deal to date in the Internet video space: the acquisition last fall of BrightRoll, a programmatic video-advertising platform, for $640 million in cash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>"I don't think Marissa Mayer's going to be breaking the bank on video content," says Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>"They're wading into it gradually to get their feet wet to see how it goes. You're probably going to not see multiple A-list actors in their shows."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>It's not the first time Yahoo has tried to make a serious run at entertainment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>In 2004, then-CEO Terry Semel, a former Warner Bros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>exec, hired Lloyd Braun, who was chairman of ABC Entertainment Television Group at the time, to cut Hollywood deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>But Braun left after two years, and Yahoo ultimately retreated from its premium-content strategy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>In 2007, Netflix launched its first subscription streaming-video service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Yahoo still has no SVOD plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>"You can't rewrite history, but Yahoo had an opportunity to capture a bigger share in this market before other people," Pyykkonen says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Under Mayer, in the past two years, Yahoo made unsuccessful bids for Hulu -- whose owners Disney, 21st Century Fox and NBCUniversal -- ultimately decided to hang on to the Internet TV company, as well as video-hosting site Dailymotion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>One of Yahoo's key challenges in pushing viewers toward Community, Sin City Saints and Other Space is that generally, people don't associate the company with video entertainment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>The site's most popular features are news and sports, email and search.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Its video lineup largely has consisted of shortform on-demand clips.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>But the company suggests that the perception is changing, claiming that users stay an average of 26 minutes per session on the Yahoo Live channel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Still, it's a crowded and noisy market, and Yahoo has to compete not only with online rivals like YouTube, AOL, Netflix and Hulu, but with broadcast and cable networks for viewers' time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>And there's the fact that in Internet years, Yahoo is ancient, having just celebrated its 20th anniversary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>It was officially incorporated March 1, 1994, as a search engine created by two Stanford U.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>grad students, Jerry Yang and David Filo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>The geeky origin of the name: It's an acronym of "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle."</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Today, the company has undeniable reach, but it trails the likes of YouTube in terms of cachet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>"Yahoo still has a very sizable audience that brands want to tap into, and it's smart for them to place these bets on video content," says Scott Marsden, senior VP of media for ad agency DigitasLBi, part of Publicis Groupe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>"But Yahoo is an older brand. YouTube is obviously the behemoth in the marketplace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>Indeed, Yahoo last year was looking to beef up its video arsenal by poaching YouTube stars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Savitt and her team approached several of the site's big names, offering them a more favourable ad-revenue split than YouTube's standard 55% cut, according to industry sources (though YouTube's top content providers generally negotiate better terms).</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>But that effort fizzled; creators saw YouTube as having a far bigger reach in video than Yahoo, and they weren't interested in abandoning their fanbases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Savitt, 51, joined Yahoo in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>She was founder and CEO of Lockerz, a rewards-based e-commerce startup aimed at teens, and before that, was chief marketing officer at retailer American Eagle Outfitters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>She says Yahoo's new lineup of original comedies is targeted at the 18-34 demo -- the one that grabs the attention of advertisers -- as opposed to YouTube, which is a teen magnet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>"I'm a big Community fan," she says, "but at my age, I'm older than the average viewer of that show. Sin City Saints is young and irreverent, and Other Space has a hip, uber-talented cast" that includes Mystery Science Theater 3000's Joel Hodgson and Trace Beaulieu and House of Lies' Eugene Cordero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Sin City Saints' Tollin, who's repped by CAA, says he jumped at the chance to bring the project to Yahoo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>The half-hour show, about a tech businessman who owns a pro basketball expansion team in Vegas, debuts next week, with all eight episodes available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>(Other Space, too, bow with eight bingeable episodes.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>"The exciting part is, it's reaching a new audience in new ways," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>"And there's a little more creative freedom. ... Yahoo gave us the opportunity to tell what are real stories in a real world, even though (the show is) fictional."</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>In moving to higher-end series, Yahoo's previous shortform strategy has fallen by the wayside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Those efforts included such originals as Burning Love, a parody of reality dating shows that was popular enough that cabler E!</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>picked it up, as well as Tiny Commando, about a four-inch-high Navy SEAL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>"It was more challenging in the shortform (format) to attract an audience we could develop over time," Savitt explains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Savitt says Yahoo will use the website's personalization technology, which recommends videos to users based on factors including their prior activity on Yahoo and social media, to help hook viewers into the new shows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>For example, if you've visited Yahoo Sports' basketball sections, you're likely to see promos for "Sin City Saints" on Yahoo Screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>The company also expects to create custom content that drives users toward the originals from its homepage and different content channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>"Our goal is to guide our billion-plus users per month to the showrunners' fantastic (content), Savitt says. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>Yahoo also will run marketing campaigns on other Internet sites and other media, including promo spots for Community and the Live Nation concert series in movie theatres through NCM Media Networks' FirstLook preshow program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>It's too soon to tell how the company's foray into pricier, scripted programming will play out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>"Everyone is waiting to see the quality of the content and the quality of the consumer experience around the content," says David Lang, chief content officer at ad agency Mindshare North America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>But Lang gives Yahoo credit for trying to separate itself from the rest of the pack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>"A lot of people didn't understand what Yahoo was about anymore, and Yahoo is now saying, these big high-quality originals are part of our strategy," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>"They're up at the plate and swinging the bat. The past couple of years, they haven't taken any big swings."</td></tr>

<h3>AP reporter in Yemen: Flight cancelled for warfare</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Forces loyal to Saleh stormed a section of the international airport in the southern port city of Aden on Thursday, triggering heavy gunbattles with security forces loyal to the current president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The fighting forced the closure of the facility and passengers on a flight to Cairo were scuttled off the plane and into the terminal building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>General view of the Aden International Airport during heavy gunbattles between a unit of police commandos loyal to longtime autocratic former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and security forces loyal to the current president, in Aden, Yemen, Thursday, March 19, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Men stranded at the Aden International Airport, wait as heavy gunbattles between a unit of police commandos loyal to longtime autocratic former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and security forces loyal to the current president, erupted in Aden, Yemen, Thursday, March 19, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A Yemeni man wears a gas mask that he looted from a base that belonged to police special forces loyal to ousted longtime autocratic President Ali Abdullah Saleh, as he walks around outside the base in Aden, Yemen, Thursday, March 19, 2015.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>A Yemeni man holds a police shield that he looted from a base that belonged to police special forces loyal to ousted longtime autocratic President Ali Abdullah Saleh, as he stands on a street outside the base in Aden, Yemen, Thursday, March 19, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Forces loyal to former President Saleh stormed the international airport in the southern port city of Aden on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Later, the troops and militiamen loyal to the current President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi completely retook the airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They then stormed the nearby base of the pro-Saleh police special forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>ADEN, Yemen (AP) - There were some brief bursts of gunfire in the distance as we boarded the bus from the terminal to our plane on the tarmac in the airport of the Yemeni city of Aden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>No one paid much attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tensions had been growing in the city for weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>One of my fellow passengers greeted the noise with a hearty laugh and shouted "Erhebou!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>- Yemeni Arabic for "Hello there!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I took my window seat, 14F, and got out my Arabic novel for the flight to Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>For the next 20 minutes, passengers argued with crew over seating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"If people sit wherever they please, then we should not be issued with seat numbers," a young Yemeni woman speaking English lectured a flight attendant who wanted her to take a seat other than the one she was assigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Finally, everyone was seated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Then the captain's voice came over the intercom: "Will passengers please leave the aircraft immediately."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>No one moved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"Will passengers please leave the aircraft, the airport has been closed," he said, more commanding this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Many still did not leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"You must disembark now," a flight attendant barked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>As I and the around 150 other passengers left the aircraft and made our way back to the terminal, it became clear why.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Bursts of heavy machine gunfire and explosions were frequent and near.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Watching from the departure hall, we saw two armored pickup trucks mounted with machine guns speed onto the tarmac and open fire at targets somewhere to the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>These were police special forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh who had stormed the airport, trying to capture control from militiamen and troops loyal to the current president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>We were caught in what would become an hours-long battle, part of the bigger conflict tearing apart this chaotic, impoverished nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Hadi had fled to Aden weeks earlier from Sanaa, which had been under house arrest by Shiite rebels known as Houthis who took over the capital and much of the north of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Aden - Yemen's second most important city and its economic hub - was once the capital of an independent South Yemen and, as Hadi is a southerner, it is full of his supporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Other members of his government, including Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subeihi, also fled to Aden and they made it their de facto government capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Saleh, the country's longtime autocratic president who was ousted by a 2011 popular uprising, still retains loyalists around the country, and he has allied with the Houthis against Hadi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>From the large windows of the Aden airport departure hall, we watched the battle unfold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Some of the passengers pressed to the glass to watch intently, others sat in the seats as if at a theater.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Besides our plane, there was another aircraft out on the tarmac, a Boeing 747 that I learned later was the presidential plane, flown in September from Sanaa to here, where Hadi thought it would be safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>By the end of fighting, it would be damaged by gunfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>After an hour of shelling and gunfire, a convoy of a car and several pickup truckloads of pro-Hadi fighters - a mix of soldiers and militiamen - swept onto the tarmac.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Out of the car stepped Defense Minister al-Subeihi in camouflage fatigues with an assault rifle slung over his shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>I could see him arguing with airport officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He then left, and I could hear the battle intensify, with tank-fire clearly audible and what sounded like mortars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>I didn't know what to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>My bag was in the plane's belly, no way to extract it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Staying at the airport was not an option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The pro-Saleh forces are among the best trained and equipped in Yemen, and they wanted to take the airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Decision made: I had better move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>By this time, most of the 150 passengers from my flight had left and had made it to the airport hotel across the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>I knew that was a walk of about 100 meters (yards).</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>What I didn't know was that that short stretch through the parking lot was now in full sight of those battling it out with assault rifles and RPGs down the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>I put my head out of the airport's gate and I could hear gunfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Not too close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>So I speed-walked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The gunfire became more intense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>It dawned on me that pro-Hadi militiamen were on my right too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>So I was in the crossfire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>I took shelter behind a car, joined by a man also trying to reach safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>The gunfire got louder and closer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Safer to run back to the airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>So I ran back in bursts of sprints to the next car or tree until I was safely back in the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>There, a militiaman with an RPG rifle was taking shelter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Panting from my unscheduled workout, I called my office in Cairo to report on the gunbattle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Fighting subsided about 10 minutes later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Three airport officials offered to give me a lift in their rickety 1970s-era Japanese car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>The driver had to take us closer to the battle, now revving back up to full throttle again, before he could make a right out of the airport road.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>I kept my head down and hoped for the best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Later, the pro-Hadi troops and militiamen completely retook the airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>When word got out that that base had fallen, the looting began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>Hundreds of militiamen and civilians - men and young children - descended on the base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>When I arrived there in the late afternoon, the area outside the base's gate resembled a Sunday outdoor market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>But this wasn't selling farm-fresh produce or home-baked cookies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Everyone was emerging from the base with something and, often, trying to sell it on the spot: window and door frames, water tanks, brand new rocket-propelled grenades in sealed plastic bags, ammunition boxes of all sizes, ceiling fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Those who weren't selling were loading their booty on vehicles causing a massive traffic jam outside the base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Children and young teens sagged under the weight of what they carried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>Riot police helmets, green combat helmets, see-through police shields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Two World War II-era tanks rumbled on the street outside, belching out black exhaust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>These were the tanks of the pro-Hadi militiamen, who had been joined by civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>One old man lay on a mattress on top of a tank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Others chewed qat, the Yemenis' favorite drug.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>One woman rode atop a tank, wearing a traditional all-black robe and face veil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>She waved the black, white, red and blue flag of once-independent South Yemen.</td></tr>
