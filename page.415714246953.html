<h3>Islamic State claims suicide bombing in Libya's Benghazi</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a separate incident in Libya's second-largest city, where army forces are fighting Islamist militants, a rocket hit a residential building, killing a 17-year old girl and another person, medics said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Three others were wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was unclear who fired the rocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Islamic State claimed responsibility for the checkpoint suicide bombing in a statement posted on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The violence in Benghazi typifies chaos in Libya where two rival governments and parliaments allied to armed factions are competing for power four years after the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Militants claiming affiliation to Islamic State, the group that controls much of Syria and Iraq, have exploited the turmoil by expanding in several parts of the oil producer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The militants have in recent weeks claimed several high-profile attacks such as the storming of the Corinthia luxury hotel in Tripoli, killing five foreigners and the beheading of 21 Egyptian Copts on a beach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A car laden with explosives drove into an army checkpoint in the Lithi district of Benghazi, where army officials say Islamist militants are holed up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Five of those killed were soldiers, the other two civilians, army officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Later in the evening, war planes took off from Benghazi airport and attacked suspected Islamist positions, said Naser al-Hasi, a spokesman for the military base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Benghazi is suffering heavy clashes almost daily between Islamist fighters and forces of the internationally recognised government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The port has been closed for more than four months, disrupting wheat and food imports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The latest violence came after Islamist militant group Ansar al-Sharia said in a statement a senior commander, Mohamed al-Areibi, had been killed in Benghazi on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Libya's official government has been based in the east since a rival faction seized the capital in Tripoli in August, reinstating a previous assembly challenging the elected assembly also based in the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Both governments rely on former rebels who helped topple Gaddafi and are now caught in a power struggle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In Benghazi the official government of Premier Abdullah al-Thinni has allied itself with general Khalifa Haftar who in May started his own fight against Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The alliance started a new offensive in October to control the city and fighting continues.</td></tr>
