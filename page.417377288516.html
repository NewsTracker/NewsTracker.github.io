<h3>Falcons LB Shembo waived after animal cruelty charge (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FILE - This June 15, 2014, file photo, Atlanta Falcons linebacker Prince Shembo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>(AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons waived linebacker Prince Shembo on Friday, shortly after he was charged with aggravated animal cruelty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Police in suburban Gwinnett County said Shembo was charged after his then-girlfriend's dog died from blunt force trauma last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Falcons moved quickly to cut ties with the player.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''We are aware of the charges that have been filed against Prince Shembo,'' the team said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>''We are extremely disappointed that one of our players is involved in something like this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The case was especially sensitive to a franchise that lost star quarterback Michael Vick after he was charged with running a dogfighting ring in 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Vick wound up serving federal prison time and never played again for the Falcons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Denicia Williams called police on April 19 to report that her ex-boyfriend had killed her dog, police said in a news release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Williams told investigators she had taken her Yorkie, Dior, to Shembo's apartment on April 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>At some point, she left the 6-foot-2, 254-pound Shembo alone with the dog, and when she found the dog later he was unresponsive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Williams took the animal to an animal hospital where he died shortly afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Shembo told her over the phone the next day that he had kicked the dog, and she ended their relationship, Williams told police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Shembo surrendered at the Gwinnett County jail Friday night and his bond was set at $16,700 according to county records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Attorney Jerry Froelich told reporters that Shembo said he was putting the dog in its cage and he kicked it after it bit his hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''When you're a small dog it doesn't take much with the size he is,'' Froelich said, adding that the dog's death was accidental.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Shembo, 23, was a fourth-round pick in 2014 out of Notre Dame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He got significant time at inside linebacker as a rookie, playing in all 16 games with three starts and making 59 tackles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>New coach Dan Quinn planned to move Shembo to outside linebacker and give him a shot at a regular role in the pass rush rotation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Now, the Falcons will have to come up with another option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>A necropsy on the dog's body was done April 21 and tissue samples were sent to the University of Georgia for further testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Police got the final results on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>While waiting for those results, a police investigator spoke to Shembo several times by phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Police decided to take out a warrant for Shembo's arrest because of inconsistencies in his account of what happened and because of the necropsy results, the release said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The dog suffered extensive injuries, including a fractured rib, abdominal hemorrhage, head trauma, eye injuries and extensive bruising in the muscles of his front leg and shoulders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Police said an investigator contacted the Falcons to let them know about the warrant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Froelich said he hadn't seen the police report as of Friday night.</td></tr>
