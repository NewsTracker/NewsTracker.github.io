<h3>NFL DRAFT: Jets grab QB Petty in trade (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CHICAGO (AP) -- Quarterbacks Bryce Petty and Brett Hundley found their way into the NFL on Day 3 of the draft Saturday - heading to entirely different circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Baylor's Petty went to the New York Jets, who've had inconsistency at the position for years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>UCLA's Hundley will journey to Green Bay, where hardly anyone can remember the last time the Packers had questions behind center.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Jets made an early splash in the fourth round after a night of contemplating who remained on the board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>New York moved up one spot in a deal with Jacksonville to get the prolific passer who operated a spread offense in college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Petty will have plenty to learn in the pros, and will have Geno Smith, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Matt Simms ahead on the depth chart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the Jets have not truly been set at quarterback since the days of Chad Pennington, and new coach Todd Bowles has no ties to the other QBs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As for the big transition, Petty was confident he can do it smoothly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''What I was asked to do in college, it was different, but it's not because I couldn't do a pro-style offense or West Coast offense or whatever,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hundley, who went in the first round of some mock drafts, instead had to wait until No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>147 overall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His next stop is Lambeau Field, hardly a quarterbacking abyss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''I think Green Bay is the perfect organization to learn as much as possible, and they have the best coaches to help me do that,'' Hundley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Another quarterback went in the fourth round - well a former QB, Blake Bell of Oklahoma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The ''Belldozer'' is now a tight end and wound up San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''In your eyes, you're kind of just, 'Hey, I played quarterback before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>So, it's I can see the coverage, man, zone, what the corner's doing, linebackers, D-ends, stuff like that,' '' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tennessee began the fourth round by taking defensive tackle Angelo Blackson of Auburn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>His partner at the position with the Tigers, Gabe Wright, went to Detroit soon after.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Cincinnati chose cornerback Josh Shaw of Southern California, who had a 10-game suspension when he lied to school officials about how he sprained his ankles in a preseason fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Shaw jumped 20 feet from a balcony following an argument with his girlfriend in late August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>He then made up an elaborate story about saving his nephew from drowning in a swimming pool.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''I know that I'm selected in the fourth round primarily because of that incident and me lying,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The first player drafted from Navy in 20 years, long snapper Joe Cardona, went 186th to New England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He was the only player at that position at the combine in February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>''Right now I'm prepared to be the best football player I can be for the New England Patriots, and the best naval officer I can be,'' Cardona said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''Whatever duty I'm doing at the time I'm doing it, I'm just prepared to do my best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The last Middie selected was tight end Kevin Hickman by Detroit in the sixth round.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>One spot earlier, the first kicker was chosen, punter Bradley Pinion of Clemson going to San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>He will try to unseat veteran Andy Lee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>''Andy's been in the league a long time and he's a great punter,'' Pinion said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>''There's a reason he's been in the league 10 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>UAB, which has disbanded its football program, had two players selected: WR J.J. Nelson to Arizona in the fifth round, TE Kennard Backman to Green Bay in Round 6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Florida State All-America TE Nick O'Leary, the grandson of Jack Nicklaus, wound up with Buffalo in the sixth, and, fittingly on Saturday, A.J. Derby, tight end from Arkansas, went to New England.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The final pick of the shortest seven-round draft at 13 hours, 45 minutes, is dubbed ''Mr. Irrelevant.'' The, uh, honor went to Louisville tight end Gerald Christian, who was selected by Arizona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In all, 24 trades were made, including two transactions involving the last tradable pick, No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>249. That wound up with Atlanta, which grabbed San Jose State safety Akeem King before the compensatory picks began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>ACC schools Florida State (11) and Louisville (10) led the way in total picks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Florida was next with eight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The three big Florida schools had 26 players chosen, with Miami adding in seven.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>But the SEC had the most players taken with 54, followed by the ACC with 47.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Among the major schools with no selections were North Carolina, North Carolina State, Syracuse, Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Colorado, Arizona and California.</td></tr>
