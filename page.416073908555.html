<h3>Things to know about Apple's new photo-storage service</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The update will bring a new Photos app for Mac computers and launch an online photo-storage service called iCloud Photo Library.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The service lets you sync photos among various personal computers and mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It also saves storage space by moving full-resolution versions online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>- To get it, go to the Mac App Store and check for updates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You'll need the new version of the Mac operating system, 10.10.3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>On phones and tablets, you need at least version 8.0 of iOS, though 8.2 is recommended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>You can also access your photos on Windows computers with Apple's free iCloud for Windows software.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>(Sorry, it's not available for Android.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>- If you don't see prompts to turn on iCloud Photo Library, go to "Preferences" on the Mac Photos app and check "iCloud Photo Library."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On iPhones and iPads, go to "Photos & Camera" in the settings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In both cases, choose the option to optimize storage to save space on your device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>- Why optimize?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>That will always keep the full-resolution version online, and what you see on your device will depend on how much space you have left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If it's running low, the Photos software will replace full-resolution images with smaller files, particularly for older shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>They will be fine to view on that device, but you might notice degradation when you zoom or crop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>As long as you're online, the software will download originals automatically when you need them, such as for printing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>- Photos on the Mac gives you the option to store photos and videos in folders, but the preferred way is for Photos to import copies into its library.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>You need to keep this default option for iCloud Photo Library to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But you will lose control over organization, as Photos takes over managing that for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>- The 5 gigabytes of free storage on iCloud won't get you far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>You can get a total of 20 gigabytes for $1 a month, 200 GB for $4, 500 GB for $10 and 1 terabyte for $20.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>- When you delete a photo on one device, it will delete across all of your others as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But, the new Photos app gives you a warning first and then about a month to retrieve the image from iCloud.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Previously, photos deleted from iPhones and iPads disappeared immediately - bad for parents with small children who like to haphazardly delete things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>- If you change your mind and want to stop using iCloud Photo Library, you'll be able to retrieve all your originals first.</td></tr>
