<h3>Deaths rise, aid flown in after Nepal quake: Things to Know</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The death toll climbed above 3,300 on Monday, two days after a magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck central Nepal and surrounding regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>How much higher the death toll would rise depends on the state of remote Himalayan villages that rescue workers were still trying to reach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Many of the roads are believed to be cut off by landslides, making it likely that some of these communities can only be reached by helicopter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The earthquake hit the capital, Kathmandu, but its impact spread far beyond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At least 18 people died on the slopes of Mount Everest, where avalanches buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Another 61 people were killed in neighboring India, and China reported 20 people dead in Tibet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Nearly 100 aftershocks, including a magnitude-6.7 temblor Sunday, have hindered rescue efforts and terrorized residents sleeping in open squares and parks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kathmandu is full of small, poorly constructed brick apartment buildings, and the quake destroyed swaths of the oldest neighborhoods, even as more modern structures stood firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Most areas were without power and water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The quake was the worst to hit Nepal in at least 80 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Nepal's worst recorded earthquake in 1934 measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The first aid flights began delivering supplies Sunday after Kathmandu's airport reopened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tents and water were being handed out Monday at 10 locations in Kathmandu, district chief administrator Ek Narayan Aryal said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The United Nations said hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded and running out of emergency supplies and space to store corpses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most shops in the capital were closed after the government declared a weeklong period of recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Only fruit vendors and pharmacies seemed to be doing business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The first nations to respond were Nepal's neighbors - India, China and Pakistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The United States, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Germany, France, Poland, Italy, Israel and Singapore also sent aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The quake unleashed a devastating avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Some warned that dozens of people may still be missing and were almost certainly dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The first group of survivors from the avalanche were flown to Kathmandu on Sunday and taken to hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>None appeared to have life-threatening injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The avalanche struck near one of the famed mountain's most dangerous spots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>It swept down between the Khumbu Icefall and the base camp used by international climbing expeditions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>There were unverified reports of avalanches on other parts of the mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Facebook postings by climbers suggested that some people may have been buried in their tents when the avalanche hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Climbers and their support teams were leaving the base camp Saturday looking for safer locations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>WHAT HAPPENED?</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said the quake happened on what is known as a "thrust fault."</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>That describes the situation when one piece of the Earth's crust is moving beneath another piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In this case, it's the Indian plate that is moving north at 45 millimeters (1.7 inches) a year under the Eurasian plate to the north, Earle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>It's a different type of earthquake than the one that caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"This is what builds the Himalayan mountain range," Earle said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The region and particular fault has a history of damaging earthquakes, including four temblors with magnitudes greater than 6.0 in the past 100 years, Earle said, warning that landslides are a particular worry now, given the steep slopes in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>HOW PREPARED IS NEPAL TO COPE WITH SUCH A DISASTER?</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Nepal is a relatively poor country without extensive resources despites its rich cultural heritage and spectacular mountain scenery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It has been plagued by instability in recent years, and general strikes have recently brought chaotic scenes to Kathmandu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Nepal's constitution was supposed to have been written by the Constituent Assembly that was elected in 2008, following the end of a 10-year Maoist insurgency and the overthrow of the centuries-old monarchy, but the assembly was hampered by infighting and never finished its work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The current assembly was chosen in 2013, but has faced the same problem.</td></tr>

<tr><td>43</td><td>Locals read morning edition of a newspaper as they stand in the middle of a street in Kathmandu, Nepal, Monday, April 27, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Nepalese queue at a gas station in Kathmandu, Nepal, Monday, April 27, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>The city is still experiencing a series of aftershocks following a massive earthquake on Saturday.</td></tr>
