<tr><td>4</td><td>YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) - With radical Islamic insurgents on its doorstep, Cameroon is trying to head off unrest at home by quelling any signs of the extremism that has roiled neighboring Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the country is also mobilizing soft power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The government sponsored a conference this week where Islamic and Christian leaders discussed promoting religious tolerance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Earlier this month, Cameroon announced $8 million in grants for young people who start businesses in the north, the country's poorest region and the one where most Muslims live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Boko Haram insurgents have been fighting the Nigerian government for six years in the hopes of creating an Islamic state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>With their own security threatened, Cameroon, Chad and Niger are now attacking the militants inside Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Military operations alone cannot defeat Boko Haram, says Bridgit Ndemba, a sociologist at the University of Yaounde, in the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"As far as ideology is concerned, fighting it will take a lot of time because we cannot fight ideology with war weapons," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cameroon - where about 20 percent of the population is Muslim, 40 percent is Christian and the rest hold indigenous beliefs - has a long history of tolerance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Ndemba says high youth unemployment and poverty in Cameroon's north could leave young people vulnerable to recruitment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Already the influence of Boko Haram can be felt in Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Some mosques in the northern regions are calling for Shariah law, according to Souleyman Abba, a cleric and member of Cameroon's Islamic Cultural Association, which helped organize the conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Muslim students and clerics are offered scholarships to study in Arab countries, raising fears they may return with extremist beliefs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Even at the conference itself, there was friction.</td></tr>
