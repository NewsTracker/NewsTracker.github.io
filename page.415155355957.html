<h3>Netanyahu says Iran deal could threaten Israel's existence</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israel's leader has praised president Barack Obama and defended the reasons for his visit to the United States, warning the nuclear deal the country is negotiating with Iran could threaten Israel's survival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu received a standing ovation from 16,000 people at the pro-Israel AIPAC conference ahead of his address to the US Congress tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In a preview of his planned speech, Mr Netanyahu voiced fears that talks between Iran and world powers would allow Tehran to become a nuclear-armed state and said this must not happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"As prime minister of Israel, I have a moral obligation to speak up in the face of these dangers while there's still time to avert them," Mr Netanyahu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the same time, Mr Netanyahu sought to ease US-Israeli tensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He said the relationship between his country and the US was "stronger than ever" and would continue to improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the office that he holds. I have great respect for both," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I deeply appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel: Security cooperation, intelligence sharing, support in the UN and much more."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>US secretary of state John Kerry has quietly cautioned Israel not to undercut Iran nuclear negotiations that resumed on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Israel's security is absolutely at the forefront of all of our minds, but frankly so is the security of all of the other countries in the region. So is our security," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The White House said on Monday Mr Netanyahu's address was unlikely to complicate ongoing nuclear talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It shouldn't, and it's because the international community is united as we continue to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the international community's concerns with Iran's nuclear program," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earlier, US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power reinforced to AIPAC that the US would not allow a nuclear-armed Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>US national security adviser Susan Rice warned US politicians on Monday not to seek new sanctions against Iran while it was in talks with world powers on curbing its nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She said such intervention could ruin the diplomacy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>However, the long-strained personal relationship between Mr Obama and Mr Netanyahu has sunk to a new low over the Israeli leader's planned speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Mr Netanyahu is expected to press US politicians to block a deal with Iran that he contends would endanger Israel's existence but which Mr Obama's aides believe could be a signature foreign policy achievement for the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The invitation to Mr Netanyahu was orchestrated by Republican congressional leaders with the Israeli ambassador without advance word to the White House, a breach of protocol that infuriated the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The White House denied it would curb US aid to Israel in response to Mr Netanyahu's bid to scuttle negotiations with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Israeli media has suggested the Obama administration could trim some of the roughly $US130 billion in existing aid and drag its feet on requests for more help with programs like the Magic Wand missile intercept system and the Arrow 3 weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"The report is false," nation security spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Obama has said he would not meet with Mr Netanyahu during this visit on the grounds that doing so just two weeks before Israeli elections could be seen as interfering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The partisan nature of this dispute has turned this into the worst rift in decades between the US and Israel, which normally navigates carefully between Republicans and Democrats in Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Washington and some allies, notably Israel, suspect Iran has used its civilian nuclear program as a cover to develop a nuclear weapons capability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Iran denies this, saying its program is for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Obama said on Monday that Iran should commit to a verifiable freeze of at least 10 years on its nuclear activity for a landmark atomic deal to be reached, but said the odds were still against sealing a final agreement.</td></tr>

<h3>Canadian pastor missing after aid trip to North Korea</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Reverend Hyeon Soo Lim, 60, has made hundreds of trips to North Korea, where he helps oversee a nursing home, a nursery and an orphanage in the Rajin region, said Lisa Pak, a spokeswoman for the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in suburban Toronto.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>North Korea and China have clamped down on Christian groups in the last year, and several American Christians have been detained by North Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Pak said they have not heard from Lim since Jan. 31 but were not initially worried because he is an experienced traveler and knows the country well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They also thought he could be caught up by North Korea's quarantine of foreign travelers who may have been exposed to Ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>North Korea ended the quarantine program on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is not an unusual trip for him ... he's not a tourist who got lost, he speaks Korean, he's been there many times," said Pak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We didn't want to cause unnecessary hysteria, just make sure he is OK. He's very non-political; he just wants to help the people."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 3,000-member church, where Lim has been head pastor for 28 years, has done humanitarian work in North Korea since about 1997, Pak said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lim immigrated to Canada from South Korea in 1986 and has a wife and grown son, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Lim left Toronto on Jan. 27, flew to South Korea, and planned to visit China and North Korea during his trip, Pak said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>After hearing from Lim on Jan. 31, the church expected him to be out of contact until Feb. 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>When he did not contact the church, it waited another 21 days to allow for a possible Ebola quarantine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Canadian government said consular officials are in contact with Lim's family members and have offered consular assistance but declined to comment on Lim's situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Ottawa advises against all travel to North Korea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The North Korean government takes a hard line against proselytizing, seeing religion as a threat to the Kim family, which has ruled it since the end of World War Two and been portrayed as demigods in state propaganda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A U.N. report this year cited estimates that between 200,000 and 400,000 of North Korea's 24 million people are Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The number is impossible to verify because most Christians cannot worship openly.</td></tr>
