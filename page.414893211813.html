<h3>DUP steps up its legal threat to BBC over TV debates</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The party has issued a pre-action letter threatening a judicial review of the decision by the broadcaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ahead of crunch talks with BBC bosses next week, DUP leader Peter Robinson slammed their stance as "unlawful and irrational" and in breach of their own duties of impartiality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Plans by the four main broadcasters - the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky - envisage two debates featuring the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru and the Greens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But parties from Northern Ireland have been left out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Referring to Plaid Cymru, the First Minister argued: "If a regional party with three MPs is in the televised general election debates, then another regional party with eight MPs and more votes should be there too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This election is unlike any election in over a generation. Many commentators predict the DUP will hold the balance of power in the next Parliament. Since we will play a central role after the election then it is right that we play a full role in the pre-election debates."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The solicitor's letter sent to the BBC said the fact that UK residents outside Northern Ireland cannot vote for the DUP does not mean the party is irrelevant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It said UK viewers should have an opportunity to see the party that might hold the balance of power performing "on the national stage, in debate with national leaders".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>And it argued that the inclusion of Ukip - which has only one MLA, David McNarry - but not the DUP, which has 38 MLAs, in the combined debates is unfair to voters in Northern Ireland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Viewers would have the opportunity to see Ukip perform head to head with the main parties but not the DUP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>This would mislead people on the respective importance of these parties "in terms of seats in Parliament and therefore influence on the political landscape", the letter said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It went on: "We hope that the BBC will agree to the DUP's inclusion, thereby avoiding the need for any legal proceedings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The BBC said it was aware of the DUP letter, but is not commenting on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But BBC chief adviser Ric Bailey has already argued that the parties in NI are in competition for votes with each other rather than the national parties.</td></tr>
