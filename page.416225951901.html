<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Reuters) - Internet users were denied access to Google Inc's Malaysia website on Tuesday, and were redirected to a hacked page saying "Google Malaysia Hacked by Tiger-Mate #Bangladeshi Hacker".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The company has reached out to the organization that manages the domain name to resolve the issue, MYNIC, a Google Malaysia spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.</td></tr>
