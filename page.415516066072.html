<h3>Ferguson police deny beating suspect</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two officers shot outside Ferguson police dept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>That's how police are responding to allegations that they beat the man arrested for shooting two police officers during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jeffrey Williams, 20, has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>"One thing that is clear is that he has a large amount of bruising on his body that I noticed that I'm very concerned about. It appears that whatever statements he made, he was without the advice of counsel, and when I look at the bruising, it's hard for me assess if these were voluntary statements that he made."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Christmas told CNN that Williams has bruising across his back, and a knot on his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"He said he was bruised by the police when he was taken into custody. And he was in a lot of pain when he was being questioned," Christmas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"They used a lot of force on him."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police deny the accusation.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>Williams is being held on a cash-only $300,000 bond, according to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, who said it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The art of Ferguson - Elaborate and inspirational murals have emerged on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri.</td></tr>

<tr><td>30</td><td>It was not an organized effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Painters wanted to bring beauty to a depressing situation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The art of Ferguson - Inspirational messages can be found on most of the murals.</td></tr>
