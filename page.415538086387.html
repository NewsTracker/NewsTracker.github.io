<h3>Will Payments On Facebook Be Successful?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>This question originally appeared on Quora: How do P2P payments work on Facebook, and are they likely to be successful?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Today March 17th, 2015 Facebook has entered into payments in a very big way [1].</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This is perhaps the biggest news in this sector since its inception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Much like WeChat a sort of Facebook of China along with Alipay with their hundreds of millions of users to send money via instant message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>To become a person to person payment system in the US the company must apply for and be granted a money transmitter license in every state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Facebook has been approved money transmitter licenses in every US state and territory along with many European and Asian countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>My good friend Faisal Khan has been researching this for a number of years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the US, there has not yet been a person to person payment system centered around a communication platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One could argue that Google's system was a communication platform centered around Gmail, but it was not fully linked to the chat system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The elements of the social graph, essentially your network of friends tied to payments is pure brilliance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The network effect takes hold and there is a tipping point where one can be certain that the recipient can be found on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The social graph also maps closely to the likely possibilities of who would be a recipient of funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It turns out a vast majority of Facebook's 500 million monthly users are logged on to Facebook Messenger with about 80 million payment cards on file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With Facebook Payments, the entire system is currently built around the Messenger platform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Fundamentally person to person payments are a form of deep communication and Facebook Messenger is a logical jumping off point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A vast majority of person to person payments begin with a conversation, perhaps already with-in messenger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Thus with the press of the new $ icon and the entry of an amount, you can send money that will arrive to the recipient's listed debit card with-in seconds.</td></tr>
