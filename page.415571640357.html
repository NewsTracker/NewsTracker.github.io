<h3>Cruise trips sink in popularity as people are put off by large ships and cost</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cruise Lines International Association data showed bookings fell 4.8 per cent, from 1.72million to 1.64million.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Such holidays survived and even thrived during the economic downturn as a greater variety of destinations became available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the bubble may be bursting, with many put off by ever larger ships, having to fly abroad to the first port, and cost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Others may be deterred by health scares such as food poisoning or ebola.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The CLIA said it was the first fall in a decade with a major factor being a lack of holidays starting in Britain or Europe meaning travellers had to fly further to pick up their cruise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The fall also means Britain loses its places as Europe's biggest cruisers, overtaken by the 1.77 million Germans who took a seabound voyage last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Overall, the number of Europeans taking a cruise rose by 0.5 per cent to 6.39 million passengers last year said the CLIA report, so Britain's fall bucked an overall trend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Andy Harmer, of CLIA, told website TravelMole: 'The UK and Ireland continue to have one of Europe's highest rates of market penetration for cruise holidays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>CLIA Europe chairman Pierfrancesco Vago said the European rise was the most significant statistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said: 'This may sound like a small achievement, but if we consider the European economic climate, we can see that this is an extraordinary result, and continues our industry's trend of steady growth year-on-year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>'While Europe is struggling to recover from the economic crisis, our industry has continued to grow.</td></tr>
