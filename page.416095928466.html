<h3>Apple Watch Isn't the Only Gadget out This Week</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prices start at $349, but can go as high as $17,000 for a luxury edition in gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple store employees will show you the range of options, including different watch cases, bands and sizes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Reservations are recommended.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But you won't be able to walk out with a watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The first orders ship out April 24th and buyers can either have watches sent directly to their homes or arrange to return to a store for pickup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The same applies even after the 24th.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Although Samsung, Motorola, Sony and other companies already have been selling smartwatches, none has been a hit beyond a small group of tech devotees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The market will be watching to see if Apple's device changes the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the Apple Watch isn't the only gadget available this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Here are five other new devices and services targeting your wallet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Apple's new laptop, simply called MacBook, debuts Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>It's the company's lightest and thinnest laptop so far, making the ultra-thin MacBook Air appear bulky by comparison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Apple borrowed many design techniques from the iPad, including eliminating the fan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The new MacBook comes in silver, gold or gray - the first time there has been a color choice since Apple ditched plastic for metal on its laptops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The base model is $1,299.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>You get double the storage and a faster processor for $1,599.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Samsung's Galaxy S6 phones and the HTC One M9 make their general U.S. debut in retail stores.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>(Online orders have been accepted for a few weeks).</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Samsung swapped its plastic back cover for more stylish metal and glass to better compete with the iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It also improved the camera and software interface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>HTC also improved its camera and has added home-screen personalization based on location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Prices vary by carrier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>No-contract versions generally start at about $650.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In time for the return of "Game of Thrones" this Sunday, HBO launched its stand-alone streaming service, HBO Now, priced at $15 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Initially, it's available only to owners of an Apple TV, iPhone or iPad, or to Cablevision's Internet-access subscribers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>HBO Now offers the same content as HBO Go, the companion app to HBO's cable channels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The difference is you don't need a cable or satellite TV subscription.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>You could also pay $15 a month to watch HBO shows online through Dish's Sling TV service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>That's on top of Sling TV's $20 monthly fee for nearly two dozen other cable channels, including ESPN and CNN.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Sling TV plans to debut HBO no later than Saturday as part of an app upgrade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>SPEAKING OF STREAMING.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>CBS' $6-a-month streaming service, All Access, is now available on Roku - the first streaming TV device for the network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The subscription offers live feeds of CBS stations in some markets, along with a bigger library of on-demand content than what's available for free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Meanwhile, the Roku 3 player now has a new remote control with a voice search button that customers can use to see what's available across multiple streaming services such as Netflix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Another feature tracks when a movie you're interested in becomes available for streaming or gets a price cut.</td></tr>
