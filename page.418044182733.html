<h3>Supreme Court Upholds Obamacare Subsidies</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The ruling means subsidies remain available to low and moderate income people in all 50 states to allow them to get healthcare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Supreme Court has upheld the availability of nationwide tax subsidies that are the bedrock of Obamacare in a second major victory for the US President.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The court ruled by a 6-3 vote on Thursday that the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, did not restrict the subsidies to states that establish their own online healthcare exchanges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Healthcare exchanges are online markets for health insurance which allow Americans to get the best deal for their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Chief Justice John Roberts was joined by fellow conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy and the court's liberal members to form the majority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The decision means that subsidies will remain, not just in the 13 states that have set up their own healthcare exchanges, but also in the three states that have hybrid exchanges and the 34 states that use the exchange run by the federal government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It is the second time in three years that the high court has ruled against a major challenge to Obamacare brought by Republicans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The case centred on the tax subsidies under the 2010 law which help low and moderate income families buy private health insurance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A four-word phrase - "established by the state" - was at the heart of the challenge, which argued it had not been correctly interpreted to allow subsidies to be available nationwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Justice Roberts said: "Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He added that nationwide availability of the credits is required to "avoid the type of calamitous result that Congress plainly meant to avoid".</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The current system will remain in place, with subsidies available in all 50 states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>If the challenge had been successful, at least 6.4 million people would have lost access to subsidies - an average of $272 a month - to allow them to afford private health insurance.</td></tr>
