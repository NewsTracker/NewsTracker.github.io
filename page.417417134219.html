<h3>Egypt begins demolishing Mubarak party HQ</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt on Sunday began tearing down the headquarters of the once-dominant party of ex-president Hosni Mubarak that was torched during the 2011 uprising that toppled him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Demolition workers, using cranes and bulldozers, began razing the four-storey headquarters of Mubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP) that overlooks the Nile in central Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An adjacent 14-storey tower that once housed offices of state-run organisations was also being dismantled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>In early 2011, angry protesters demanding the ouster of Mubarak had ransacked and set fire to the NDP headquarters and the adjacent tower -- seen as symbols of his autocratic rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Last month the government approved plans to demolish the buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Both buildings are located close to the famed building of the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities near Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square -- epicentre of the anti-Mubarak revolt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I was requested to demolish the buildings, including the foundations, in three months. After we finish this, we will start the second phase to convert it into a park," said contractor Ragab Hafez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He said about 200 workers would be involved in the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mubarak's NDP party was ordered officially dissolved in 2011 but a court in July lifted a ban on former members running in elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A court in November dropped murder charges against Mubarak, 87, in connection with the deaths of some 800 protesters during the uprising.</td></tr>
