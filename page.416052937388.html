<h3>Hayatou: All of Africa will vote for Blatter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) " The head of African football says his entire continent will back Sepp Blatter for re-election as FIFA president next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football, made the comment in his speech at the opening of its congress in Cairo on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter was also present.</td></tr>
