<h3>Greek PM Tsipras seeks party backing after abrupt concessions</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has appealed to his party's lawmakers to back a tough reform package after abruptly offering last-minute concessions to try to save the country from financial meltdown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>With creditor institutions due to deliver an initial verdict on Athens' loan request and reform proposals within hours, euro zone partners appeared to be preparing for a deal at the weekend to keep Greece in the euro zone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After walking into a party meeting to applause, Tsipras tried to rally his Syriza lawmakers behind the new proposals ahead of a snap vote in parliament expected late on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He urged them to help Greece stay with the euro, but he faced some resistance from leftists stunned by his acceptance of previously spurned austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We are confronted with crucial decisions," Tspiras told his party caucus, according to a Greek official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We got a mandate to bring a better deal than the ultimatum that the Eurogroup gave us, but certainly not a mandate to take Greece out of the euro zone," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We are all in this together."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The latest reform package was strikingly similar to the terms Greeks rejected in a referendum just last Sunday, angering members of the Syriza's hardline Left Platform wing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Five of them signed a letter saying it would be better to return to the drachma, Greece's pre-euro currency, than to swallow more austerity with no debt write-off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The proposals are not compatible with the Syriza program," Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who belongs to the far-left faction, told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He declined to say how he would vote in the plenary ballot expected late on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We will take it step by step."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Even with a rebellion from within his own ranks, Tsipras was assured of backing from opposition lawmakers to carry the vote, but his political position would be weakened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The centrist opposition To Potami party and the main center-right opposition New Democracy said they would support him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Germany, which has contributed more to bailouts than any other country, sounded wary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A finance ministry spokesman ruled out any debt restructuring that would lower its real value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>France, Greece's strongest supporter in the euro zone, rushed to offer praise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>President Francois Hollande called the offer "serious and credible".</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem described it as a "thorough piece of text" but declined to go into specifics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Broad support in Greece gives it more credibility, but even then we need to consider carefully whether the proposal is good and if the numbers add up," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"One way or the other, it is a very major decision we need to take."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The lenders' backing is crucial for euro zone leaders to support the proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Dijsselbloem, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde discussed the plan in a teleconference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The euro gained more than 1 percent against the dollar and European markets rallied on the improved prospects for a last-ditch deal to keep Greece in the currency area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Italian, Spanish and Portuguese bond yields fell, reflecting perception of reduced risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Greece and its creditors appeared to be closer to a deal, calling for an adjustment to Athens' debt burden to ease its cash flow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Greece still has to overcome hardening attitudes toward it among euro zone partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Some, including a senior member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, greeted the latest reform proposals with scepticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Slovakia's finance minister questioned whether the proposals went far enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Finance ministers of the 19-nation euro area will meet on Saturday to decide whether to recommend opening negotiations on a third bailout program despite exasperation at the five-year-old Greek crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A senior EU official said the meeting would include discussions on whether Greece needs some debt relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Greece asked for 53.5 billion euros ($59 billion) to help cover its debts until 2018, a review of primary surplus targets in the light of the sharp deterioration of its economy, and a "reprofiling" of the country's long-term debt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Any new deal would also have to be endorsed by national parliaments including in Germany.</td></tr>
