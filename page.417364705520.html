<h3>Islamic State claims responsibility for Baghdad hotel bombs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BAGHDAD, May 29 (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility on Friday for bombings outside two heavily fortified five-star hotels in the Iraqi capital that killed 10 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a statement, Islamic State said a suicide bomber called Abu Qutaiba had parked a car outside the Ishtar hotel in central Baghdad late on Thursday before driving another vehicle laden with 230 kg of explosives to the nearby Babylon hotel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The bomber detonated himself and the vehicle he was driving there around the same time the first car bomb exploded, "killing and wounding dozens of infidels", according to the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Iraqi authorities lifted a decade-old night-time curfew on Baghdad early this year, seeking to restore a sense of normality to the capital as security forces battle Islamic State insurgents who have overrun large parts of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the rate of bombings in Baghdad has increased since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Militants seized Ramadi, the Anbar provincial capital west of Baghdad, on May 17 in the most significant military setback to the government since a U.S.-led coalition launched a campaign of air strikes against Islamic State last August.</td></tr>
