<h3>Morris scores in US 2-0 win over Mexico in friendly</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN ANTONIO (AP) " Jordan Morris scored early in the second half and Juan Agudelo added his first international goal in four years as the United States downed Mexico 2-0 in an international friendly Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Morris, a 20-year-old thought to be the first university student to make the U.S. run on side in at least two decades, pounced on a ball that ricocheted off defender Mario Osuna in the 49th minute and beat goalkeeper Cirilo Saucedo from close range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Agudelo replaced Morris in the 65th and scored seven minutes later with a low shot from just outside the penalty area, his third international goal and first since March 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Agudelo replaced Morris in the 65th minute and scored seven minutes later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Michael Bradley made a long pass from midfield and Agudelo controlled it just outside the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He cut inside with half a dozen touches and beat Saucedo to the near post with a low shot from 19 yards (meters).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It was the third international goal for Agudelo and first since March 2011.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Playing his second international match since November 2012 and his first since March last year, he dropped to his knees and was mobbed by a group of teammates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The U.S. has defeated Mexico by 2-0 in four straight home World Cup qualifiers, all in Columbus, Ohio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>With the U.S. looking ahead to this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup, Klinsmann mixed a squad of veterans and young players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Morris, who trained with the national team last May and made his debut at Ireland in November, started because captain Clint Dempsey is sidelined by a hamstring injury and Jozy Altidore was serving a one-game suspension for a red card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mexico's best chance came late in the first half when Eduardo Herrera ran into the penalty area and poked a low cross past goalkeeper Nick Rimando into the side netting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>El Tri had complained about the field conditions on Tuesday and by game time the grass was uneven, with large brown and dirt patches causing players to slip and stumble several times.</td></tr>
