<h3>Australia football chairman disappointed at Blatter win</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Football Federation Australia chairman Frank Lowy on Saturday said he was disappointed at Sepp Blatter's re-election as president of FIFA but hoped he would work to restore the body's reputation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Blatter withstood calls for him to resign from world football's governing body amid a corruption scandal and won a fifth term as FIFA president on Friday after his challenger Prince Ali bin al Hussein of Jordan withdrew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An FFA statement said Lowy "was disappointed at the outcome of the FIFA presidential vote and hoped that re-elected president Sepp Blatter would follow through with his promise to begin work immediately to restore FIFA's standing".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"It is a democracy and Mr. Blatter was duly elected," Lowy said in the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"He was very clear in acknowledging that FIFA faced a real challenge to restore its standing and Australia will play its role along with other associations to try to achieve this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>FIFA was rocked on Wednesday with the arrest of several of its officials on corruption charges, but it was adamant that its congress and leadership vote went ahead as planned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>FFA had said ahead of the vote in Zurich that it would seek a fresh start and vote for Prince Ali, saying the organisation needed "profound change" as soon as possible to address issues of governance and transparency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Australia's switch of allegiance away from Blatter, to whom Lowy had been a long-time ally, has raised concerns about the FFA's standing within the Asian Football Confederation, of which it is a member, and which supports Blatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the FFA's decision received widespread support and approval in Australian football circles and Lowy said Saturday that moves for change were apparent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The vote secured by Prince Ali was not insignificant and reflects a belief within FIFA and the world football community that governance and other reforms need to be implemented as soon as possible," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Australia bid for the 2022 World Cup but received just one vote of support.</td></tr>
