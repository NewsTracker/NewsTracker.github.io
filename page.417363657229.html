<h3>Lawsuit seeking independent probe of prosecutor's handling of Ferguson shooting back in court</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLAYTON, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- A St. Louis County judge is set to resume hearing arguments in a lawsuit seeking an independent probe of the county prosecutor's handling of grand jury proceedings in the Ferguson police shooting of Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Judge Joseph Walsh III will continue hearing the case Friday after suspending proceedings last month while giving strong indications that he may toss the lawsuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The activists who filed the lawsuit want Walsh to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate county prosecutor Robert McCulloch's handling of the Brown case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>They say the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson, who was a white Ferguson officer, in the fatal shooting of Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was inappropriately influenced by McCulloch's desire for Wilson not to face charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A Justice Department investigation also cleared Wilson.</td></tr>
