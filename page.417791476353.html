<h3>Romanian leader slams PM's attendance at European Games</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) - Romania's president says he didn't know the Romanian prime minister would attend the European Games, which most European Union leaders have avoided because of concerns about host Azerbaijan's human rights record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Premier Victor Ponta traveled to Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, for the opening of the games Friday hours after he survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko also attended the opening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Protests against Azerbaijan's human rights record took place in cities around the world Friday before the opening ceremony.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>President Klaus Iohannis called Ponta's attendance at the games "a foreign policy gaffe," and said Monday he had not known about the visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ponta, who heads the ruling Social Democratic Party, was recently named in a corruption probe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Relations have soured between the two leaders after Iohannis asked Ponta to resign due to the probe and he refused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Prosecutors said Ponta is suspected of money laundering, forgery, tax evasion and conflict of interest from 2007 to 2008 when as a lawmaker he allegedly received money for a SUV and payment for apartments without doing any work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Still, a bid to lift his immunity failed last week and he also survived a no-confidence vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ponta's foreign policy adviser Radu Magdin, who has a pro-U.S. stance, resigned Friday after six months in the post.</td></tr>
