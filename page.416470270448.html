<h3>Microsoft profit, revenue beats Wall Street view; shares up</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday reported revenue and profit above Wall Street expectations, as sales of its hardware and cloud-computing services helped to offset a decline in the company's core Windows business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shares rose 3.1 percent to $44.70 in after-hours trading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The company beat across the board," said FBR Capital markets analyst Daniel Ives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The Street will cheer these results as it appears Microsoft is back on the right track after a head-scratching performance last quarter."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sales of Windows to computer manufacturers to install on new PCs fell 19 percent in the quarter, reflecting a sharp dip from a year ago when Windows got a brief boost from consumers rushing to buy new machines after Microsoft stopped support for the 14-year-old XP operating system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That decline was offset by higher revenue from its Surface tablet, back-end server software and cloud-related offerings such as its online Office 365 suite of applications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The company said its commercial cloud-related revenue for the quarter more than doubled, and was now running at $6.3 billion a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday its quarterly cloud revenue rose almost 50 percent to $1.57 billion, suggesting a similar annual number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Microsoft's overall revenue rose 6 percent to $21.7 billion, above Wall Street's average forecast of $21.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Taking out the effects of the strong U.S. dollar on currency rates, Microsoft said revenue would have risen 9 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Earnings per share declined to 61 cents per share from 68 cents in the year-ago quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Analysts had expected 51 cents, on average.</td></tr>
