<li>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Greece is unlikely to exit the euro, either intentionally or accidentally.</li>
<li>But it might be forced to introduce an alternative means of payment, in parallel to the euro, to pay some domestic bills if a reform-for-cash deal with its creditors is not secured soon, several euro zone officials said.</li>
<li>"At some point, when the government has no more euros to pay salaries or bills, it might start issuing IOUs -- a paper saying that its holder would receive an x number of euros at a point in time in the future," one senior euro zone official said.</li>
<li>"Such IOUs would then quickly start trading in secondary circulation at a deep discount to the real euros and they would become a 'currency', whatever its name would be, that would exist in parallel to the euro," the official said.</li>
<li>"The arrangement could be temporary to keep the government going as it hopes to negotiate a deal with creditors that would unlock more euros in loans," a second euro zone official said.</li>
<li>"If they were to default, it is better to do that inside the euro zone rather than outside, because then it would become a problem of all the countries sharing the euro, rather than just Greece," a third official said.</li>
<li>"There is no means of forcing a country out of the euro zone or out of the European Union and Greece has no intention of leaving on its own," the second euro zone official said.</li>

<li>Describing the annoyance that has been building up among euro zone countries with the new Greek government's approach, one euro zone official said: "For many people the teleconference this afternoon could be something of a last straw."</li>
<li>They said EU leaders could not offer Tsipras anything more than the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, because any further financial help to Athens hinged on reforms that Greece would have to implement, despite its great reluctance.</li>
<li>Euro zone officials believe Athens has made unrealistic promises it cannot now finance.</li>
<li>While Greece agreed early last week to restart talks with its creditors on what reforms would have to be implemented to unblock further loans from the euro zone, there has been no progress since then apart from cooperation of technical teams to gather relevant data.</li>
<li>Time is running out because Athens is likely to run of cash by the end of the month and may then default on its debt, potentially forcing itself out of the euro zone.</li>
