<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) " Greece's government spokeswoman says negotiators from the country's creditors are arriving in Athens to get technical negotiations on a new, multibillion-euro rescue package underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, Olga Gerovasili told the Associated Press that high-level talks won't start until later this week at the earliest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>She said senior staff from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund will only arrive in Athens "Thursday or later."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Negotiators were initially expected to arrive last Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Stock markets in Europe have fallen amid fears that the delay means Greece's third bailout is already encountering difficulties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gerovasili said there's "no reason" for the delay and said it was the creditors who decided when to get the talks underway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She said the talks will take place in a "hotel in the center of Athens," without specifying.</td></tr>
