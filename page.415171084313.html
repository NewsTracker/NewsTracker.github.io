<h3>Simon Rattle to lead London Symphony Orchestra</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Sir Simon, 60, said it will be his "last job".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He has spent the last 12 years in Berlin, widely considered to be the best orchestra in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Asked if the LSO matched up to the same standard, he gave a diplomatic reply: "I'm leaving a world class orchestra and I'm coming to another world class orchestra."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The management of the LSO said it was "a great day" for the orchestra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Earlier this month, Sir Simon signalled a desire to return but said London lacked a world-class concert hall, dismissing the 1,940-capacity Barbican Hall as merely "serviceable".</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"You have no idea how wonderful an orchestra like the London Symphony Orchestra can sound in a great concert hall," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>His campaign for a new venue has the support of George Osborne, who announced a feasibility study into the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Announcing his new appointment at a press conference at the Barbican, Sir Simon said coming to the LSO was not contingent on the hall being built.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But he will continue to lobby for the project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"It's going to be incredibly important, not only for the orchestra and the city but the country as a whole - to be able to bring a new vision to music, one that can include as many people as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The LSO's principal conductor, Valery Gerviev, stands down at the end of this year and the orchestra will be without a leader until Sir Simon takes up his post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sir Simon is the first to hold the title of LSO music director since Claudio Abbado in the 1980s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The role is greater than that of principal conductor, with education and outreach at its heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Frankly, what goes on in the primary school is going to be just as important as what goes on in the concert hall. Until everybody sees that as a continuum, we're going to have a problem," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A key aim is to bring classical music to a new audience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"One of the things that attractred me to the LSO is their often unsung work in the boroughs of London, how powerful that is and how much it can change people's l ives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We have to make sure this information gets through to people. It may not be for absolutely every person but every person should have the possibility of experiencing it and seeing what it can bring to their lives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Liverpudlian-born Sir Simon, 60, became Britain's youngest music director at 25, when he took charge of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He joined the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002, and during his time there fought for its musicians to be paid a better wage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He is married to his third wife, mezzo-soprano Magdalena Ko&#x17e;ena, with whom he has three children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>For their sake, he will continue to be based in Germany despite taking up the LSO post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"My family live in Berlin. I have young kids at school, where we're also close to the Czech Republic where Magdalena is from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Certainly for the time being we imagine still living in Berlin. On the other hand, I will be here with the orchestra for four months in the year, which is an enormous amount. And of course I will have a home in London.</td></tr>
