<h3>Microsoft's $15B hedge against the dollar: Analyst</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>What's behind Microsoft's big beat?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>To combat the strong dollar, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) engaged in about $15 billion in currency hedging in the latest quarter, longtime Microsoft analyst Rick Sherlund said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"That's the gross value to protect against currency moves," said Nomura Securities' managing director, who made his calculations based on Microsoft filings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The strengthening dollar was a 3 percent drag on the top and bottom lines in the quarter ended in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But the tech giant, after the market closed Thursday, reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It was [a] less bad quarter. But they set expectations low enough that the Street was happy with the results," Sherlund told CNBC's " Squawk Box " after upgrading the stock to a buy with a $50 price target.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Microsoft was trading at $46.11 a share Friday morning, up more than 6 percent from Thursday's close.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's not the monopoly business they used to have. But it's a business that can grow single digits in revenues," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"They can ... enhance earnings about 4 percent from the share buyback."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In its earnings statement, Microsoft pointed to increasing usage of its enterprise cloud service Azure, cloud-based Office 365, search engine Bing and Xbox Live gaming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The business is in transition to the cloud. They are now the world's biggest cloud vendor at $7.1 billion in annualized revenues, growing over 100 percent per year," Sherlund said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"But it's still small, about 8 percent of the [overall] business."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"It's unhooking from Windows and trying to let Office be the next platform for innovation of productivity," he continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The Windows business is about 30 percent of earnings and that's in a secular decline."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sales of Windows software to computer manufacturers to install on new PCs fell 19 percent for the quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Going forward, the Nomura analyst sees tough comparisons for Microsoft in the next two quarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Last year, PC sales picked up because people were upgrading. There was an end of life of Windows XP, the older operating system."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Microsoft is going aggressively after the cloud, a business that's also big for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>As part of its quarterly results late Thursday, Amazon broke out sales for its robust Web services arm for the first time-saying it's a $5 billion business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant's overall loss for the quarter was in line with estimates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Revenue beat, but forward guidance was light.</td></tr>
