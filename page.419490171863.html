<h3>Did Apple make Dr. Dre apologize for beating women?</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Is Apple behind Dr. Dre's abuse apology?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Did Apple demand Dr. Dre apologize to "the women I've hurt" following refreshed allegations that he physically abused women more than 20 years ago?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Since the release of the hit film "Straight Outta Compton," the rapper-music mogul has been the target of accusations about his past.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>While not addressing specific allegations, he told the New York Times, "Twenty-five years ago, I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I apologize to the women I've hurt. I deeply regret what I did."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sources said the furor was a concern for Apple, which bought his Beats empire last year for $3 billion, made him an exec, and doesn't need a scandal to affect Apple Music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The article says Dre issued the apology to the newspaper (and not the music press) because "the uproar was threatening not only his reputation, but also his business dealings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple said, "We believe his sincerity, and after working with him for a year and a half, we have every reason to believe that he has changed."</td></tr>
