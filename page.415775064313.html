<h3>Google loses appeal bid over suing</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Google has lost a Court of Appeal bid to prevent British consumers having the right to sue it in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A group known as Safari Users Against Google's Secret Tracking want to take legal action in the English courts over the internet giant's Apple Safari internet browser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>They accuse Google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and to target them with personalised advertisements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Three appeal judges have dismissed Google's appeal over a High Court ruling against it and ruled claims for damages can be brought over allegations of misuse of private information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Today's ruling was a victory for Safari Users, including editor and publisher Judith Vidal-Hall, and Robert Hann and Marc Bradshaw, who are both IT security company directors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They say Google's ''clandestine'' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and early 2012 led to distress and embarrassment among UK users.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They accuse Google of collecting private information without their knowledge and consent by the use of "cookies" - a small string of text saved on the user's device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dan Tench, a partner at law firm Olswang, which represents the group, said the landmark case decides "whether British consumers actually have any right to hold Google to account in this country".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Tench said: "This is the appropriate forum for this case - here in England where the consumers used the internet and where they have a right to privacy."</td></tr>
