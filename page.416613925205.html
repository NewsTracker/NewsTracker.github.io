<tr><td>13</td><td>BALTIMORE (AP) - Schools reopened across the city and tensions seemed to ease Wednesday after Baltimore made it through the first night of its curfew without the widespread violence many had feared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>With 3,000 police and National Guardsmen keeping the peace and preventing a repeat of the looting and arson that erupted on Monday, the citywide, 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew ended with no reports of disturbances.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>Just before midnight Tuesday, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts declared the curfew a success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We do not have a lot of active movement throughout the city as a whole. ... Tonight I think the biggest thing is the citizens are safe, the city is stable," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"We hope to maintain it that way."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Police said 35 people were arrested after the curfew went into effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>In an interview broadcast Wednesday on "The Steve Harvey Morning Show," President Barack Obama said the riots show that police departments need to build more trust in black communities.</td></tr>
