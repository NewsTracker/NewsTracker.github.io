<li>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Facebook's Messenger app is evolving into a multitasking tool equipped to send an animated fist bump to a friend at one moment and then get a little business done in the next.</li>
<li>The push to diversify Messenger addresses a potential threat to Facebook's ubiquitous social network posed by a variety of mobile messaging maps offering more intimate and direct ways to connect with friends.</li>
<li>The growing popularity of mobile messaging, though, could result in less time spent on social networks, a shift that would give Facebook fewer opportunities to learn about its users' interests and show the digital ads that make most of the company's money.</li>
