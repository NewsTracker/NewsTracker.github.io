<li>Businesses can now include a "send message" button in ads that appear in Newsfeed that allow Facebook users to click a button and send messages, which are private.</li>

<li>Facebook to scale up free mobile Internet service to boost usage</li>
<li>MUMBAI (Reuters) - Facebook Inc plans to scale up its service to offer free basic Internet on mobile phones, an executive said, after introducing the application in 17 developing countries over the past year.</li>
<li>In a blog post released to mark the first year of the initiative, Facebook said it will open a portal allowing any mobile operator to offer the service under its Internet.org platform.</li>
<li>Facebook currently partners with specific operators to launch the service in different countries.</li>
<li>It offers pared-down web services for free to users, along with access to Facebook's own social network and messaging services.</li>
<li>Facebook was not paying for any of the data being used to access the service, he said.</li>

<li>Facebook defeats shareholder litigation over IPO</li>
<li>In the case decided on Friday, shareholders alleged that Facebook should have disclosed its internal projections on how increased mobile usage might reduce future revenue.</li>
<li>Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said that because Facebook made its disclosures before going public, shareholders could not have contemporaneously owned its stock, and thus could not sue its directors and underwriters.</li>
