<h3>The Latest: Much unanswered in wordy Greek ballot question</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Greek referendum does not address whether Greece should abandon the euro currency or leave the 28-member European Union, but many voters believe those issues are at stake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Polls published Friday showed the two sides in a dead heat over whether to accept creditors' demands for more austerity or reject them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But an overwhelming majority of those polled - about 75 percent - wanted Greece to remain among the 19 European nations using the shared euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Here's the yes-or-no question Greeks face Sunday - and it's not an easy one: "Must the agreement plan submitted by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund to the Eurogroup of 25 June, 2015, and comprised of two parts which make up their joint proposal, be accepted? The first document is titled 'reforms for the completion of the current program and beyond' and the second 'Preliminary debt sustainability analysis. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Greece's prime minister says the country's austerity referendum is sending the message that Greeks are embracing a united Europe but want to live "with dignity."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said after casting a 'no' ballot Sunday that the vote demonstrates the Greek people's right to choose their own future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said although many Greeks may pick a different choice than the government, "no one can ignore the will of the people to take their lives in their hands."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tsipras said the referendum "defeats fear and ultimatums."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tsipras wants the "no" side to win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He says that will booster his negotiating position to secure a better deal with creditors for loans to avoid a default and a banking collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Which will help Greece more - voting "yes" or "no" to accepting more austerity demands from creditors?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says a "no" vote would strengthen his hand to negotiate a better deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But proponents of a "yes" vote, including a parade of former prime ministers and the main opposition party, say backing his government will jeopardize Greece's place in the club of 19 nations who use the common euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Instead, they argue by voting "yes" Greece would get a new deal quickly to shore up its sinking economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Conservative opposition leader Antonis Samaras cast his ballot Sunday, saying "we vote 'yes' to Greece. We vote 'yes' to Europe."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Greek referendum on whether or not to accept bailout demands by creditors is causing deep divisions, even among individual families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Dimitris Danikoglous says he is voting "yes" because he fears Greece would be in danger if it leaves the European Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>His daughter Alexandra is voting "no" because she is tired of richer European nations bossing Greece around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>His son, Nikolas, is on his side - and he thinks polarized Greece may be on the verge of a civil war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>His wife Dimitra distrusts both the Yes and the No campaigns and doesn't plan to vote in Sunday's momentous referendum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>In their apartment in the working-class Athens neighborhood of Tavros, the family members squabble over espresso frappes and fruit juice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Still, they are united in their belief that only as a strong family can they weather the coming storm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Polls have opened across Greece in a hastily called referendum on whether the EU country will accept the tough creditor conditions attached to loans needed to avoid default and a banking collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A "no" may lead to a chaotic departure from the shared euro currency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Even "yes" is no guarantee that creditors will agree to lend the billions more euros needed to get the country back on its feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is banking on fellow Greeks to deliver a resounding "no" in the popular vote that he believes will give him strong leverage in his negotiations with creditors - the EU and the International Monetary Fund - to swing a softer bailout deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Proponents of a "yes" vote, including the main opposition party, say backing the government will jeopardize Greece's place in the 19-nation eurozone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Instead, they argue voting "yes" will allow Greece to get a new bailout deal quickly to shore up the economy.</td></tr>
