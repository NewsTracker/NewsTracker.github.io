<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY (AP) - Officials at Mexico's state-run oil company say they are searching for three missing workers from a platform fire that killed four others, and are beginning to restore production at the damaged gulf facility.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>Estimated production of 646,000 barrels of crude a day and 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas in the region won't be affected by the fireball that hit the processing platform Wednesday, Hernandez said Sunday.</td></tr>
