<tr><td>10</td><td>Siri can also handle more complex requests, such as ones to show you all photos from a particular place and time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The responses are context and device sensitive - so what Siri gives you to listen when you're out for a run might be different from when you enter a car.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>The new Mac system will be more formally known as OS X 10.11, as it's the 11th update to a system adapted from the NeXT operating system that co-founder Steve Jobs brought to Apple when he returned in 1997 after an exile.</td></tr>

<tr><td>35</td><td>The conference runs through Friday at the Moscone convention center in San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Apple isn't the only company to be previewing its plans for this fall.</td></tr>
