<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) -- Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland, his girlfriend and another woman were stabbed early Wednesday following an argument on the street near a Manhattan nightclub that also led to the arrest of two Atlanta Hawks players, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The violence broke out just before 4 a.m. outside 1Oak Club, a trendy Chelsea spot where celebs like Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg mingle with partygoers, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The couple was arguing on the street as the attacker eavesdropped and started to interfere, according to police.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>The suspect, Shezoy Bleary, was in custody, authorities said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Police said charges were pending, and it wasn't clear whether Bleary had an attorney who could comment on the charges.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>The victims were hospitalized and in stable condition, police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A knife was recovered at the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Atlanta Hawks players Pero Antic, 33 and Thabo Sefolosha, 30, who were not with Copeland but were also at the club, were arrested after police said they blocked officers from trying to start their investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The teammates were in town to play the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The team arrived late Tuesday, after beating the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Antic and Sefolosha were released without bail after a brief court appearance where they were charged with obstructing governmental authority and disorderly conduct.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Their attorney, Alex Spiro, said they did not commit any crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''They should not have been arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>We fully expect the case to be dismissed,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Hawks officials did not indicate whether the two would play Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sefolosha was limping during his appearance and Spiro said he had been injured during the arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The two are reserves, averaging less than 6 points per game on a team that has locked up the top playoff seed in the Eastern Conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Garin Narain, the Hawks vice president of public relations, said in a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday morning that the team is investigating the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning,'' Narain said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>In a statement, the club disputed the police account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>It said the altercation stemmed from a dispute at a public housing project about two blocks away from the nightspot and that Copeland's driver grabbed the suspect, who was later arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''The incident occurred beyond the view of our security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Once alerted the venue provided all assistance possible,'' the statement read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The club did not say how Copeland got back to the front of the club on West 17th Street, where the street was splattered with blood from the altercation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The nightclub had been cited at least 10 times for altercations and four times for noise in 2014, according to data obtained by the New York Post from the State Liquor Authority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Associated Press writers Jeff Martin in Atlanta and Rick Callahan in Indianapolis contributed to this report.</td></tr>
