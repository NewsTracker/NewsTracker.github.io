<tr><td>2</td><td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the United States on Sunday to seek a better deal to curb Iran's nuclear program and said he would press American lawmakers not give Tehran "a free path to the bomb."</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>The Israeli prime minister has been strongly critical of the framework agreement struck on Thursday between world powers and Iran, saying it does not do enough to protect Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"This is not a partisan issue. This is not solely an Israeli issue," Netanyahu said on CNN's "State of the Union" program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"This is a world issue because everyone is going to be threatened by the pre-eminent terrorist state of our time, keeping the infrastructure to produce not one nuclear bomb but many, many nuclear bombs down the line."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu angered the White House and alienated some Democrats when he accepted a Republican invitation to address Congress on March 3, two weeks before the Israeli elections that returned him to office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Netanyahu denied he was coordinating with House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who visited Israel last week, and with other Republicans to block the Iran deal.</td></tr>
