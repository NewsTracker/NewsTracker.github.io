<h3>Islamic State accused of bulldozing ancient Assyrian city</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Islamic State group has been accused of bulldozing the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, in the jihadists' latest attack on Iraq's historical heritage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>IS "assaulted the historic city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy vehicles," Iraq's tourism and antiquities ministry said on an official Facebook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>An Iraqi antiquities official confirmed the news and said the destruction began after noon prayers on Thursday and that trucks that may have been used to haul away artefacts had also been spotted at the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Until now, we do not know to what extent it was destroyed," the official said on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Nimrud, which was founded in the 13th century BC, lies on the Tigris around 30km southeast of Mosul, Iraq's second city and the main hub of IS in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I'm sorry to say everybody was expecting this. Their plan is to destroy Iraqi heritage, one site at a time," said Abdulamir Hamdani, an Iraqi archaeologist from Stony Brook University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Hatra of course will be next," he said, referring to a preserved city in Nineveh that is more than 2,000 years old and is a UNESCO world heritage site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I'm really devastated, but it was just a matter of time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The destruction at Nimrud, one of the jewels of the Assyrian era, comes a week after the jihadist group released a video showing militants armed with sledgehammers and jackhammers smashing priceless ancient artefacts at the Mosul museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That attack sparked widespread consternation and alarm, and some archaeologists and heritage experts compared it to the 2001 demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan by the Taliban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In the jihadists' extreme interpretation of Islam, statues, idols and shrines are a corruption of the purity of the early Muslim faith and amount to recognising objects of worship other than God.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The group spearheaded a sweeping offensive last June that overran Nineveh province, where Mosul and Nimrud are located, and swept through much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Mosul region was home to a mosaic of minorities, including the Assyrian Christians, who consider themselves to be the region's indigenous people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Iraqi security forces and allied fighters are battling to regain ground from the jihadists with backing from an international anti-IS coalition as well as neighbouring Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But major operations to drive IS out of Nineveh are likely months away, leaving the province's irreplaceable historical sites at the mercy of the jihadists.</td></tr>
