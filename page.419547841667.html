<h3>Greece: Opposition party head returns mandate to form gov't</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) " The head of Greece's main opposition party is meeting the country's president to return his mandate to form a government after failing to find coalition partners following the prime minister's resignation and call for early elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Evangelos Meimarakis, head of the conservative New Democracy party, returned the mandate Monday after the three-day limit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It now passes to the third-largest party in Parliament, a new group formed by hardliners who split from the governing radical left Syriza party last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Neither party was expected to be able to form a government, and early elections are most likely to be held on Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras resigned on Thursday, just seven months into his four-year mandate, following a rebellion in his party over Greece's new bailout.</td></tr>
