<h3>The first wearable you'll actually want to wear - and the answer to obsessively checking your mobile: Dailymail.com's verdict on the Apple Watch</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>For the last week, I've been one of the lucky few outside Apple to have one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>While it's not the first smartwatch on the market, it is the first you'll actually want to use - and will change the way you communicate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Apple Watch - while it's not the first smartwatch on the market, it is the first you'll actually want to use - and will change the way you communicate, at least if you're a phone addict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As a phone addict, I can rarely go ten minutes without checking my handset.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However, after a day or two with the Apple Watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The haptic engine means when an alert comes in, you simply receive a 'tap' on the wrist - and a single glance down shows you exactly what you need to know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It's a huge change in the way we communicate, making it more personal, and more socially acceptable to stay in touch - a quick tap on your wrist to reply means you are unlikely to annoy whoever you're with (until you take a call on the watch and start talking into your wrist, admittedly).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It's a beautifully made device, and I went for the 42mm stainless steel Apple Watch, the larger of the two sizes available (the other being 38mm).</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>I also got to try out three of the bands - the brown leather loop strap, the Milanese loop, and the white sport band.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While in pictures it looks a little chunky, on the wrist its rounded edges make it incredibly comfortable - and both the Milanese loop and the brown leather loop strap are held in place by magnets, making them easy to adjust.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The first challenge I faced, probably along with many other buyers, is that I don't usually wear a watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even the act of looking down at my wrist again took a few days to get used to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Most of the time you wear it, the watch screen is off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But thanks to some smart software and sensors, when you move your wrist to look at it, the display appears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This works surprisingly well, and only very occasionally did I find myself looking down and not seeing the display pop on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The initial watch face can be easily swapped, and customised to your heart's content to show everything from the sun's position in the sky to a dancing Mickey Mouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The screen is superb - bright with deep rich colours, and Apple has taken full advantage of this with some of its face designs, which feature blooming flowers and jellyfish gliding behind the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>You can change colours and the information displayed - known as 'complications', a very un-Apple like term used by the watch industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I found I changed faces more than I expected - it's rather nice being able to have a clear display with your diary during the day, but switch to Mickey at weekends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The real key to the watch is the haptic engine, which is how it tells you you have a text message, email, or even need to change direction when you're using the maps app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Using an accompanying app, you can manage these notifications - and this is the key to using the watch - getting them at the right level so they aren't annoying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>You can also use Apple's VIP email function to do the same for emails, so you only get alerts when certain people send you a message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Milanese loop (left) and the white sports strap - two of the bands we tested with the stainless steel version of the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>These cost $699 ( 599) and $599 ( 519) respectively - although you can buy extra straps separately.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Some of the 'glances' on the Apple watch, showing your fitness data (left) and your location in the Maps app (right).</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Rather than the annoying loud buzz and vibration of other gadgets, the haptic engine is extremely subtle - and feels almost like you're being tapped on the wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>It's an extremely personal way to notify people - and nobody around you is aware of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Every time you take the Watch off your wrist, it locks, and you'll need to put in your passcode before it will do anything once you put it back on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Getting around the Watch also takes a little getting used to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>It is completely alien the first few times you try it, with the combination of touchscreen, the digital crown and the contacts button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>However, after a day or two, it becomes second nature, and the digital crown in particular is an astonishingly well made piece of hardware, feeling just the right amount of solid as you use it to scroll through longer lists without obscuring the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>With the current, very limited crop of apps, the digital crown is only really used to scroll through long lists - such as email, messages and music.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>However, once more apps appear it is expected it to play a larger role in how the watch works.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>One of the easiest ways to communicate using the Watch is via the messages app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>This allows you to use Siri to dictate replies, and to send new animated emoji (which you can even customise, changing their colour).</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>You can even bypass the interface all together, and just raise the watch and say 'Hey, Siri' to reply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>However, Apple has also added some new features to allow you to communicate with other Watch owners by sending drawings, taps and even your heartbeat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>It's great fun, and the doodling app is particularly good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>There's also a built in microphone and speaker, meaning you can make calls on the Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>While being British means I was unable to test this in public without being extremely embarrassed at talking ostentatiously into my wrist, it actually works well - and calls are surprisingly clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>While for longer messages you'll probably want to turn to your phone or computer, for short replies, the Apple Watch is more than adequate - particularly as you can set your own stock responses, and they will also adapt to the message, taking a guess at what you are most likely to say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Being able to quickly tap out a reply without opening your phone is a huge timesaver and also socially far less annoying for everyone around you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>There are also some new gestures to learn with the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Swiping up from the bottom of the screen shows you glances - small pieces of information such as the weather - your heart rate and the music controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>But there are times when the information takes a while to update and appear, and this is something Apple needs to improve with app updates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Bear in mind the company has until 24 April when customers actually have the watch in their hands to do this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Despite this, some of the glances are simply jaw-droppingly good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>For instance, the Transit App which, here in New York, shows me how long I'll have to wait for the next subway train to take me home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Swiping down shows you your notifications, and a red dot appears when you have them waiting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Much has been made of the battery life of the watch, and in use, it's surprisingly good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>During my week with the Watch, it didn't once run out of power - even when using the fitness tracker function to track my morning dog walks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>However, you will need to charge it every night, using a magnetic charger you pop onto the back of the phone - so it can't track your sleep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>The main screen of the watch, which shows icons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>You can tap them with a finger, or zoom in using the scroll wheel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Apple says over 1,000 apps have now been submitted for the Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>One of the key features of the Watch, according to Tim Cook at least, are its fitness functions, and these work very well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>It'll track your movement as standard, but there's also a fitness app which will also keep an eye on your heart rate and offer more advanced capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>It can also remind you every hour to stand up if you haven't - which can feel a little Big Brother-esque at first, but I actually rather grew to like it - even if it did mean I drank even more coffee than normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>The Watch also includes Passbook, which is incredibly useful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>I was able to to check in for flights using it - although be warned it won't fit under the scanners used at many boarding gates - and it also includes Apple Pay, so in the US at least, you can use your watch to pay with a tap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>I found it worked flawlessly on our Apple Pay enabled office vending machines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Once you've paired your iPhone with the Watch, a new app appears on your phone to let you see your data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>On the watch, there's also a fitness app.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Additionally, you can set stand goals - this means the watch will tell you every hour if you haven't stood up - a welcome reminder to take a break (and you can turn it off for those long days in the office).</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>It can feel a little Big Brother-esque at first, but I actually rather grew to like them - even if it did mean I drank even more coffee than normal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>Measuring your heartrate does mean you need to keep the watch relatively tight to your skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>On the back of the Watch's case, a ceramic cover with sapphire lenses sits above a sensor that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect the wearer's heart rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>While using the Milanese loop, this was initially an issue, especially if running.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>However, I found swapping to the rubber sports band made a huge difference - and it's extremely comfortable to wear, even when playing squash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>Apple Watch uses this sensor, along with an accelerometer and the GPS and Wi-Fi in a connected iPhone, to measure physical movement such as steps, distance and calories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>Will the Apple Watch change your life?</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>While Apple may be the firm that really created phone addiction, with the Watch they may have cured it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>There were only a few apps available for us to try, but some like travel app Transit and Citymapper show what the Watch is capable of - and expect an explosion in the number of apps once developers get their hands on the hardware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>There are a huge range of bands available for the Watch - with Apple hoping many owners will buy more than one, and they can easily be swapped.</td></tr>

<tr><td>81</td><td>Tim Cook boasts that the Apple Watch will be the first smartwatch than matters - and he is absolutely right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>That's not to say the watch is perfect at launch, and the loading time for apps needs to be addressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>However, this is something that may well have improved- or disappeared altogether - by the time the final apps are available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>Overall, after a week with the Watch, I wouldn't want to be without it now - if only because I'd have to go back to fishing my phone out of my pocket every five minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>While Apple may be the firm that really create phone addiction, meaning we are constantly check our handsets, with the Apple Watch, it may have cured it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands - but like the iPad, it isn't really obvious why you would want the product, until you try it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Models: The Apple Watch will be available in three models: the Apple Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>All models will be sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions depending on which colour the owner chooses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>Apple Watch is made of stainless steel with a sapphire crystal Retina display and ceramic back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Apple Watch Sport is made of 7000 Series Silver Aluminum with Ion-X Glass on a Retina display and composite back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>Apple Watch Edition has a similar build to the Apple Watch but comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Interchangeable straps include fluoroelastomer (rubber), leather, and stainless steel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>Prices: Apple Watch is made of stainless steel and prices range between $549 and $1048 for the 1.4-inch model and $599 and $1099 for the larger 1.7-inch version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>Watch Sport is made of 7000 Series Silver Aluminum and ranges from $349 to $399.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>The premium Edition has a similar build to the Apple Watch but comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>Prices start at $10,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>All of the watches can be pre-ordered from 10 April and goes on sale on 24 April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>In the UK, Sport starts at 299, the standard Watch starts at 479 and the Edition model will cost 8,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Gestures: Following last year's unveiling, Apple admitted the Watch is unlike any device it has ever made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>It said it has 'reinvented all-new ways to select navigate and input that are suited to a smaller device worn on the wrist'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>The Watch is also said to be able to sense force adding 'a new dimension to the user interface'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Force Touch uses electrodes around the flexible display to distinguish between a light tap and a deep press, and trigger instant access to a range of contextually specific controls - such as an action menu in Messages, or a mode that lets you select different watch faces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>Digital Crown: On mechanical watches, the crown has historically been used to set the time and date and to wind the mainspring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>Apple has adapted this and its 'digital' crown can be used to magnify content on the small display.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>Rotating the digital crown replaces the typical pinching motion used on iPhones and iPads and allows wearers to zoom and scroll without obstructing the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>Pressing the crown will also return wearers to the home screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>Watch OS: The Watch OS software is tweaked it to better suit the watch's power, display size and functions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>Apple has also invented a new typeface to make the screen easier to read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>Sapphire display: Apple Watches have a laminated Retina display made from a 'single crystal of sapphire.' While on the Sport collection the screen has the added protection of Ion-X glass.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>Glances: The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>For instance, wearers can glimpse the weather forecast, check out what's next on their calendar, or find their location on a map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>They can then swipe through different Glances, or tap on one to go directly to its corresponding app for more details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>Vibration and notifications: The Watch has a built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>Any notification that appears on the connected phone will appear on the Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>This is made from a linear actuator, or motor, inside the Apple Watch that produces haptic feedback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>The wearer can then respond to these messages directly or swipe down to see the Notification Centre.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>This haptic feedback could also be used with Apple Maps, for example, to help people navigate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>It will produced gentle vibrations to signal when to turn left or right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>The Watch additionally understands questions in messages and offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>And this taptic engine means people can get someone's attention with a gentle tap or send their heartbeat remotely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>There is no keyboard on the Watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji.</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>Siri is also built into the Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>Heart rate sensor: On the back of the Watch's case, a ceramic cover with sapphire lenses sits above a sensor that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect the wearer's heart rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>Inductive charging: The Watch uses Apple's MagSafe technology with inductive charging.</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>This means it can be charged wirelessly by placing a connector near the back of the watch where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>MagSafe is the name of the connector Apple uses with its MacBook range.</td></tr>
