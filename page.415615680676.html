<h3>Alabama jury convicts woman of capital murder in 9-year-old granddaughter's death from running</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- An Alabama jury convicted a woman of capital murder in the running death of her 9-year-old granddaughter on Friday, rejecting claims that she didn't mean to harm the girl while she was punishing the child for a lie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Joyce Hardin Garrard faces a penalty of death or life without parole for the February 2012 death of Savannah Hardin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Garrard showed no reaction when the verdict was read, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>She glared toward the audience as she walked out silently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Relatives sitting behind her began to cry loudly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Defense attorney Dani Bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict, delivered after about hours of deliberation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Garrard's husband Johnny sat behind her, hugging a crying daughter before the woman ran from the courtroom sobbing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The judge said the sentencing phase - a mini-trial within the trial - will begin Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Jurors will hear additional testimony and make a decision on whether to recommend life without parole or death, but the final decision is up to the judge under Alabama law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Authorities claimed the 49-year-old woman forced Savannah to run and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Savannah eventually had a seizure and died three days later in a hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The defense denied the woman meant the girl any harm, but jurors rejected that claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Garrard had testified she only made the girl pick up sticks in her yard as punishment the day of her collapse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Garrard testified that the girl did run, but only as practice for races at school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Prosecutors contended that Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"She was tortured," Griffith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Defense attorney Richard Rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9-year-old Savannah while the girl's father was overseas working as a contractor for the U.S. State Department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Some witnesses who testified about seeing Garrard force Savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than Garrard appeared to be, Griffith said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But Rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said, "I think we have all had the thought: 'If it was that bad, why didn't they do something?'" He said witnesses didn't notify police about their concerns until days later, after they heard girl was on life support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The child's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, is free on bond awaiting trial on a murder charge for allegedly failing to intervene as Garrard made Savannah run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Hardin has pleaded not guilty, but no trial date is set.</td></tr>
