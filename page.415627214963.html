<h3>FBI: Autopsy in hanging death of Mississippi man days away</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- The body of a black man found hanging in a tree in Mississippi has been sent from a state crime lab to a funeral home, but the FBI said it will be days before autopsy results are complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Until then, investigators are holding off on saying whether Otis Byrd was killed or took his own life, and they're urging people to be patient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The community deserves answers. Specifically, the family deserves answers," Don Alway, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Jackson, told a crowd Friday outside the Claiborne County Courthouse in Port Gibson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He said preliminary information about the cause of death is expected next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We're doing everything in our power to be transparent, to talk about what's going on so far," Alway said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"But we want to reiterate that individual, single pieces of information and bits of rumors, we're going to hold off on speaking to those until we can collectively come to a conclusion and get you the truth that everybody deserves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The county coroner confirmed that the man found hanging from a white sheet Thursday was Byrd, a 54-year-old ex-convict who was reported missing by his family more than two weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Byrd lived just 200 yards from the spot where his body was found, in woods behind his house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Alway said investigators are interviewing Byrd's family and friends and searching his rental home and a storage unit for clues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We are trying to paint a picture of Byrd's life. We are trying to find out what was going on with him personally and professionally," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Claiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas Sr. told The Associated Press earlier Friday that Byrd did not appear to have stepped off of anything in the area where he was found hanging by a sheet from a tree limb about 12 feet high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>His feet were dangling about 2 feet off the ground, and his hands were not bound, Lucas said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Life matters," Lucas told the crowd at the courthouse where he appeared with Alway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I commit to you, as the sheriff of Claiborne County, that I will not allow the shadows of the past to cast a shadow on the future."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Byrd's body was released on Friday to a Port Gibson funeral home, said Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesman Warren Strain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>An employee at Rollins Funeral Home said funeral arrangements will be made early next week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Byrd worked on offshore oil rigs and enjoyed gambling in casinos in his off time after getting out of prison, where he served 26 years for fatally shooting a woman while robbing $101 from her convenience store in 1980.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He wasn't the type to kill himself, friends and family said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"He tried to turn his life around. He was going to church every Sunday," said his stepsister, Tracy Wilson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Lora McDaniel, a high school classmate who went to church with Byrd and his family, said "he always had a smile on his face. I just can't see him committing suicide."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"He was a quiet man. He didn't bother nobody," added Anita Smith, another high school classmate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"He had been out nine years and all of the sudden this happens to him? Impossible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Smith said she is planning to participate in a march Monday in Port Gibson to protest Byrd's death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mississippi NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he doesn't want people to rush to judgment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We just want to make sure there's a thorough federal, state and local investigation," Johnson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The hanging is being investigated by the FBI, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the United States Attorney's office as well as the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>These officials are on the scene to determine if it's a potential hate crime or other violation of federal law, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Claiborne County sits on the bluffs of the Mississippi River, with Natchez to the south and Vicksburg to the north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>About 85 percent of the county's 9,250 residents are African-American.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Port Gibson is in the district of U.S. Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Bennie Thompson, a Democrat and the only black member of Mississippi's congressional delegation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He issued a statement calling on the government to use "every resource available to bring swift justice" if foul play was involved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Given the history of the state, it is unavoidable that the hanging of a black man in Mississippi justifiably engenders deeply raw emotions," Thompson said.</td></tr>

<h3>Eagles: 60-minute man Chuck Bednarik has died at 89 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Chuck Bednarik, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and one of the last great two-way NFL players, died early Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He was 89.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Known as ''Concrete Charlie,'' Bednarik epitomized the tough-guy linebacker and also was an outstanding center for the Eagles from 1949 to 1962.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He is best remembered for a game-saving tackle at the 9-yard line on the final play of the 1960 title game, and it was typical Bednarik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He threw Green Bay running back Jim Taylor to the ground and refused to let him up while the final seconds ticked off as the Eagles held on for a 17-13 win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''Everybody reminds me of it and I'm happy they remind me of it,'' Bednarik once said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He died at an assisted living facility in Richland, Pennsylvania, following a brief illness, the Eagles said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Two of his daughters said Bednarik had dementia, an affliction common in former professional football players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Pamela McWilliams, who also believes football injuries played a role in his decline, said her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>''I certainly think it played a big role in it - he took a lot of blows and they certainly didn't have the safety equipment they have now back then,'' McWilliams told The Express-Times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Bednarik, who frequently criticized modern athletes, said he played on all but two kickoffs against the Packers and could have kept playing if he needed to, unlike today's players who ''suck air after five plays.'' He missed only three games in his 14-year career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The tackle on Taylor actually was the second hit that season that drew headlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earlier in 1960, he knocked out New York Giants running back Frank Gifford with a blow so hard that Gifford suffered a concussion and didn't play again until 1962.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An iconic photograph captured Bednarik pumping his fist over Gifford's prone body, though the linebacker insisted he wasn't gloating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said he didn't notice what happened to Gifford after the hit and only saw that he had fumbled and another Eagle recovered the ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Bednarik was the last NFL starter to play regularly on both offense and defense until Deion Sanders did so for Dallas in 1996.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sanders' achievement hardly impressed Bednarik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''The positions I played, every play, I was making contact, not like that ... Deion Sanders,'' Bednarik said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>''He couldn't tackle my wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Born May 1, 1925, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Bednarik flew 30 combat missions over Germany as a gunner during World War II.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He then played center for Penn from 1945 to 1948, and was selected first overall in the 1949 NFL draft by the Eagles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In 1950, he was All-NFL as a center, then he was voted All-NFL as a linebacker in 1951 through 1957, and again in 1960.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Bednarik, whose gnarled fingers in retirement stood as a reminder of the ruggedness of his profession, said he never made more than $27,000 in a season and supplemented his income by selling concrete, earning his nickname.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>At one point, he pawned his championship ring and his Hall of Fame ring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In early 2005, when the Eagles won the NFC championship and had Philadelphia in a Super Bowl frenzy, Bednarik was bitter enough to root for the Patriots in the Super Bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He later apologized to owner Jeff Lurie and was a welcomed visitor at training camp and other alumni functions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''Philadelphia fans grow up expecting toughness, all-out effort and a workmanlike attitude from this team and so much of that image has its roots in the way Chuck played the game,'' Lurie said in a statement released by the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The Maxwell Football Club presents an award in Bednarik's honor to the defensive player of the year in college football.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Bednarik is survived by his wife, Emma, and five daughters -Thomas, McWilliams, Donna Davis, Carol Safarowic, and Jackie Chelius, as well as 10 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.</td></tr>
