<h3>Islamic State second-in-command killed in air strike: White House</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The White House has confirmed Islamic State second-in-command Hajji Mutazz has been killed in a US military air strike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Fadhil Ahmad al-Hayali, also known as Hajji Mutazz ... was killed in a US military air strike on August 18 while travelling in a vehicle near Mosul, Iraq, along with an ISIL media operative known as Abu Abdullah," White House spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Al-Hayali's death will adversely impact ISIL's operations given that his influence spanned ISIL's finance, media, operations, and logistics," Mr Price said, using another name for the group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The White House said the dead leader was a "primary coordinator" for moving weapons, explosives, vehicles, and people between Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was in charge of operations in Iraq and helped plan the group's offensive in Mosul in June of last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The news comes as fragments from mortars fired by IS militants at Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq earlier this month tested positive in a US military field test for the chemical weapons agent sulfur mustard, a US general said on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The United States and its allies stage daily air strikes on Islamic State targets in the group's self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A drone strike last month killed a senior Islamic State leader in its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>One counter-terrorism specialist cautioned that the impact of the killing on Islamic State could be short-lived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"My experience in looking at the Islamic State suggests they have demonstrated an ability to move people up into positions" when high-ranking operatives are killed, said Seth Jones, a former Pentagon official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Jones said how much territory Islamic State controls was more important in determining the group's power.</td></tr>
