<h3>Sisi warns of response after Islamic State kills 21 Egyptians in Libya</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Speaking on national television hours after the release of the video, Sisi said Cairo would choose the "necessary means and timing to avenge the criminal killings".</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Egypt's state news agency MENA quoted the spokesman for the Coptic Church as confirming that 21 Egyptian Christians believed to be held by Islamic State were dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The beheadings could stiffen Sisi's resolve in dealing with security threats from militants thriving in neighboring Libya's chaos who want to topple his U.S.-backed government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Egypt has denied reports in the past that it had taken part, along with its close ally the United Arab Emirates, in air strikes against militants based in Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The footage showing the deaths of the Egyptians appeared on the Twitter feed of a website that supports Islamic State, which has seized parts of Iraq and Syria and has also beheaded Western hostages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the video, militants in black marched the captives, dressed in orange jump suits, to a beach the group said was near Tripoli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They were forced down onto their knees, then beheaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A caption on the five-minute video read: "The people of the cross, followers of the hostile Egyptian church."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Before the killings, one of the militants stood with a knife in his hand and said: "Safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Thousands of Egyptians desperate for work have traveled to Libya since an uprising at home in 2011, despite advice from their government not to go to a country sliding into lawlessness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sisi, who met with the country's top military commanders to discuss the killings, called for a seven-day mourning period, state television reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Coptic Church said it was confident the government would seek justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Al Azhar, the center of Islamic learning in Egypt, said no religion would accept such "barbaric" acts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The families of the kidnapped workers had urged Cairo to help secure their release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In the mostly impoverished southerly Minya Governorate, relatives screamed and fainted upon hearing news of the deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Egypt, the most populous Arab state, has not taken part directly in the U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, focusing instead on the increasingly complex insurgency within its own borders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Militants based in Libya have made contact with Sinai Province, a group operating from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula that has changed its name from Ansar Beyt al-Maqdis and pledged allegiance to Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The group has killed hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police since the army toppled Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>With Libya caught in a chaotic power struggle between two rival factions operating their own governments, Western officials worry that Islamist militants are taking advantage of the turmoil to strengthen their presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>A number of Islamist militant groups have been active since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 left Libya without a strong central government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A few have declared ties to the radical Islamic State and claimed high-profile attacks over recent weeks in what appears to be an intensifying campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Fears that the crisis in neighboring Libya could spill across the border have prompted Egypt to upgrade its military hardware.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>French President Francois Hollande has said Egypt will order 24 Rafale fighter jets, a naval frigate and related military equipment in a deal to be signed in Cairo on Monday worth more than 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion).</td></tr>

<h3>Our First Home wins ratings war against X-Factor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But TV One's Our First Home still managed to trump X-Factor in last night's ratings war, claiming 40,000 more viewers than the TV3 singing competition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Our First Home saw 345,000 viewers tune in for the second week of the renovation series, ahead of 305,000 viewers who watched X-Factor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But when compared to the average audience for each network, Our First Home has delivered disappointing results for TV One, which shed more than 163,000 viewers from its 7pm lead-in programme, Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This week's ratings are down more than 20 per cent when compared to last Sunday's debut episode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>X-Factor NZ, meanwhile, managed to grow TV3's Sunday night audience to become the most-watched programme on the network last night and the top trending topic on Twitter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It also dominated the key consumer demographic of 18-49, drawing 164,000 viewers, nearly 55,000 more than TV One.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But those figures are still down significantly from the first season of X-Factor in 2013, which saw more than 467,000 viewers tune in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Reviews for Our First Home were damning when it premiered last week, with the Herald's Michele Hewitson describing it as: "....both hokey and insincere and has more holes in it than the floorboards in the crappy do-ups on offer."</td></tr>
