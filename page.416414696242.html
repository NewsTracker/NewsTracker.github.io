<h3>Egypt's former president Mohammed Morsi sentenced to 20 years</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt's former president Mohammed Morsi has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But a court in the country's capital Cairo acquitted the 63-year-old leader of charges that would have seen him face the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Fourteen others were convicted on the same charges, with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But the court cleared the defendants on charges of inciting murder over the deaths of a journalist and two protesters during the December 5, 2012 clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, came to power following the 2011 ouster of Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>But after just a year in power, Morsi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass street protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Other Brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and Tuesday's decision to acquit Morsi on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>'This is a surprise... We were expecting them to be convicted of murder,' Ramy Ghanem, a lawyer for an anti-Morsi protester who was wounded in the clashes, told AFP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>'But the sentences are not bad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>We were expecting life in prison, but then 20 years is not very different,' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called 'unprecedented in recent history'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Earlier this month, a Cairo court confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and 13 others over protest violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Brotherhood had called for protests in support of Morsi on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'The coup commander is exploiting the judiciary,' it said in a statement ahead of the verdict, referring to Sisi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty, including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Verdicts in those two cases are due on May 16.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sisi has vowed to 'eradicate' the Brotherhood, an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between Mubarak's fall and Morsi's presidential election victory in May 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The authorities designated it a 'terrorist group' in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The crackdown sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups, who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Officials say more than 500 police and soldiers have been killed in attacks since Morsi was overthrown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Sisi was elected president in May last year, but he faced no serious challengers and - in a country where the army has been in power for decades - his victory dashed hopes raised by Mubarak's ouster of a civilian democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Sisi's regime is popular among many Egyptians tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>But Sisi has been accused of repression and his crackdown has also targeted secular and liberal activists who spearheaded the 2011 uprising against Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In November, a court dropped murder charges against Mubarak in his own trial over the deaths of hundreds of protesters in 2011.</td></tr>
