<h3>Facebook sets $15 hourly min wage for contractors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook (FB) is adding its weight to a national campaign to raise pay for low-income workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The social networking firm is setting a $15 hourly minimum wage for the employees of contractors and vendors, while also mandating that they get paid sick time and vacation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"Women, because they comprise about two-thirds of minimum wage workers nationally, are particularly affected by wage adjustments," wrote Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, in a blog post Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Research also shows that providing adequate benefits contributes to a happier and ultimately more productive workforce."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At a daily briefing with reporters, White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Wednesday cited Facebook for setting an example of leadership on the issue in the private sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We don't see companies like Facebook doing this for charity, they think it's good for business."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The upgraded compensation standards cover contractors and vendors that "do a substantial amount of work" for Facebook in the U.S., Sandberg wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Beyond setting a wage floor of $15 an hour, the benefits include a minimum 15 paid days off for holidays, sick time and vacation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Facebook is also requiring that contract workers who do don't get paid parental leave receive a $4,000 new child benefit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>That will give "both women and men the flexibility take paid parental leave, an important step for stronger families and healthier children," Sandberg said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The new standards, which took effect May 1, are already in place for some of Facebook's largest support teams at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The company will implement the program with a wider range of vendors within the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The federal minimum wage in the U.S. has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009, with a lack of congressional support dooming several bills to raise it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Most recently, Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Bobby Scott, D-Virginia, and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington State, proposed raising it to $12 over the next five years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But the measure stands virtually no chance of being enacted, given it has no support from Republicans who hold majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The roadblock to higher pay on Capitol Hill isn't stopping individual states and cities from hiking their minimum wage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Twenty-one states raised their minimum wages in January, benefiting more than 3 million workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Seattle enacted a $15 per hour minimum wage, the highest in the country, in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>On Thursday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the creation of a board to determine whether fast-food workers in the state are adequately paid, a move that circumvents state lawmakers who rejected an increase in the state's minimum wage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The momentum behind higher wages has drawn support from the "Fight for $15" movement, a campaign of fast-food, retail and other lower-paid workers that have held rallies in cities around the U.S. and college campuses in support of higher wages.</td></tr>
