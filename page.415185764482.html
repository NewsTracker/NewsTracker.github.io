<h3>U.S. report finds racial bias in Ferguson Police Dept.</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They accounted for 85 percent of traffic stops, 90 percent of tickets and 93 percent of arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In cases like jaywalking, which often hinge on police discretion, blacks accounted for 95 percent of all arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The racial disparity in those statistics was so stark that the Justice Department has concluded in a report scheduled for release Wednesday that there was only one explanation: The Ferguson Police Department was routinely violating the constitutional rights of its black residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The report, based on a six-month investigation, provides a glimpse into the roots of the racial tensions that boiled over in Ferguson last summer after a black teenager, Michael Brown, was fatally shot by a white police officer, making it a worldwide flashpoint in the debate over race and policing in America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It describes a city where the police used force almost exclusively on blacks and regularly stopped people without probable cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Racial bias is so ingrained, the report said, that Ferguson officials circulated racist jokes on their government e-mail accounts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In a November 2008 e-mail, a city official said Barack Obama would not be president long because "what black man holds a steady job for four years?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Another e-mail included a cartoon depicting African-Americans as monkeys.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A third described black women having abortions as a way to curb crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"There are serious problems here that cannot be explained away," said a law enforcement official who has seen the report and spoke on the condition of anonymity because it had not been released yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Those findings reinforce what the city's black residents have been saying publicly since the shooting in August, that the criminal justice system in Ferguson works differently for blacks and whites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A black motorist who is pulled over is twice as likely to be searched as a white motorist, even though searches of white drivers are more likely to turn up drugs or other contraband, the report found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Minor, largely discretionary offenses such as disturbing the peace and jaywalking were brought almost exclusively against blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>When whites were charged with these crimes, they were 68 percent more likely to have their cases dismissed, the Justice Department found.</td></tr>
