<h3>Robinson pleased with Ferguson progress</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ferguson crossed for two second-half tries in Monday's 20-12 win over Penrith - his first scores for the club in only his third game since ending his exile from the game following his sacking by Canberra in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Blake was really good when he got the opportunities, I thought there was a bit more space for him," Robinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I actually thought our back-rowers had stormers and opened up the game for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ferguson spoke on Sunday about his desire to put his wild ways behind him and, with a child on the way, is fully aware of the consequences that will follow should he mess up off the field again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Robinson said he's been happy with the 25-year-old's attitude but said he's had to rein in his enthusiasm and desperation to be a match winner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"He is a little bit better in mindset this week," the coach said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"He is so keen to play well for us. He's trying so hard to do everything we're asking and we're trying to free him up as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Blake's worked so hard to play for us. (Mitchell) Pearcey and Jimmy (Maloney) gave him a bit more space to suit his style and we got our rewards from that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Skipper Pearce said Ferguson's slotted in well with the rest of the squad since his arrival and his defensive efforts were more impressive than his two tries.</td></tr>
