<h3>East-West Link payout obscene: Morrison</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A senior federal government minister has labelled as obscene the Victorian government's decision to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to extricate itself from a controversial road contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Social Services Minister Scott Morrison says there are many more worthy ways to spend the $339 million the state's taxpayers will provide for a consortium contracted to build the East-West Link, or the $81 million that's been spent setting up a credit facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"For the Victorian government to spend $420 million to pay to a company not to build a road is an obscenity," Mr Morrison told reporters in the NSW Illawarra region.</td></tr>
