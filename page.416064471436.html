<h3>Ferguson election could reshape City Council</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ferguson currently has just one black member of its six-person City Council, even though African-Americans make up about two-thirds of residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The lone black member, Dwayne James, is not up for re-election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After Tuesday, at least two, and possibly three African-Americans will be on the council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Three of the six council seats are at stake in the first Ferguson municipal election since a white police officer last August fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The shooting sparked sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis area, and spawned a national "Black Lives Matter" movement to press for change in how police deal with local minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It also prompted a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which decided not to prosecute the white police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>But the federal department released a scathing report blasting the city for racial bias and profiling in the police department and a profit-driven municipal court system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The new city council will be tasked with approving hiring of the replacements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The scrutiny in the wake of the shooting also found that the city of 21,000 residents had a mostly white police force and city leadership - the mayor also is white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The race for the 3rd Ward, which includes the apartment complex where Brown was killed, involves two black men - Lee Smith, 76, and Wesley Bell, 40 - guaranteeing that an additional black resident will join the council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The 1st Ward features four candidates, two black and two white.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The 2nd Ward race involves two white men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Still, turnout is expected to be low, which isn't unique for municipal elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Turnout for the local election last April was 12.3 percent, said Eric Fey, director of elections for St. Louis County.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A strong push was made after the shooting to register more black voters, but Fey said just 562 new voters were added to the rolls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In recent weeks, the focus has been on getting those who are registered to vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>On Tuesday, severe storms that roiled the region appeared to be dissuading would-be voters from venturing to the polls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Fey said it wasn't immediately clear how many ballots had been cast as of mid-day, or how turnout compared to previous spring municipal elections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"In general, so far what we've been hearing is (turnout) has been light. The weather has been very bad so far," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But the weather didn't deter Marty Einig, who has participated in Ferguson protests since August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The 3rd Ward voter appeared buoyed by the election's potential.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"I see there is raw material within this community to demonstrate hope," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I see a glass that's half full, and I feel that the people have the will to force change."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Charrolynn Washington agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Voting at the First Presbyterian Church of Ferguson, she said the election is where real change will occur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"As much change is needed here in Ferguson, this is where we begin - not out there in the streets, doing what they were doing - but, right here," Washington said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"They need to be voting and putting people in position to make the change and make the decisions that need to be made."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 2 city council candidate Bob Hudgins poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The city is preparing for an election on Tuesday when three of six city council seats will be decided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 3 city council candidate Lee Smith poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 3 city council candidate Wesley Bell poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 1 city council candidate Ella Jones poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 1 city council candidate Doyle McClellan poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 1 city council candidate Mike McGrath poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>In this photo made in March 2015, Ferguson Ward 2 city council candidate Brian Fletcher poses for a portrait in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Rich Baranowski, second from left, and Tracy Hardy, second from right, vote as poll workers sit nearby during Ferguson's municipal election Tuesday, April 7, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Three of the six city council seats are up for grabs in the St. Louis County town where 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black, was fatally shot by a white Ferguson police officer in August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Voters head to the polls in a municipal election Tuesday, April 7, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.</td></tr>
