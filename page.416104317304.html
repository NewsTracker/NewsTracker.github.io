<h3>Apple Watch Reviewer Revelations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The long-awaited Apple Watch goes on sale this Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Luckily, reviews of the tech giant's first new gadget in five years are in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After wading through all the reports, I was struck by how eerily reminiscent they were of early iPhone reviews.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If I had to summarize them in one sentence, it would be this: Apple's first wearable is a breakthrough product that's eons ahead of the competition but, unless you're a real fan-boy or power user, you'll probably want to wait for the next version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The Apple Watch makes you look good. But the next one is bound to make you look even better."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Recode called it the best experience of any smartwatch they tested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They recommend it for iPhone power users and wearable fans but cautioned that it's not for everyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The company has succeeded in making the world's best smartwatch [It's] cool, it's beautiful, it's powerful, and it's easy to use. But it's not essential. Not yet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The Apple Watch is light-years better than any of the feeble, clunky efforts that have come before it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But "You don't need one. Nobody needs a smartwatch."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It took three days for me to fall for the Apple Watch. But once I fell, I fell hard The first Apple Watch may not be for you - but someday soon, it will change your world."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Just for kicks, I thought it would be interesting to rewind the clock back to 2007 and see what reviewers had to say about the first iPhone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>After a long list of cons, including weak app support, Ars Technica said they're not planning to buy an iPhone or any other smartphone today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>They plan to wait.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"The argument that the iPhone does nothing new is valid but it's a huge step in the right direction while not for everyone, its impact on the industry will be tremendous."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Here's the verdict I'd give any good friend: Wait to buy the iPhone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Packed with enormous capability and app potential, Apple Watch means different things to different people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Joanna Stern praised its looks, coolness and workout chops, others noted the calendar alert, boarding pass, hotel entry, and Apple Pay capabilities are great for busy travelers on the go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Several reviewers noted significant performance issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While some of the watch's functionality and many third-party apps appear to be flaky, I would expect most of those problems to improve with subsequent software updates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Apparently, constant taps or vibrations on your wrist can become really annoying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>If you get a zillion emails a day you'll probably want to mute that function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>One of the biggest knocks is, unfortunately, nothing new: Siri.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Owing to its tiny keyboard-less screen, the watch relies heavily on voice control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>While Siri ably controls native apps like making calls, sending messages and playing music, when it comes to getting information, it's still hit or miss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There were a few contradictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Farhad Manjoo focused on the device's steep learning curve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Meanwhile Joshua Topolsky seemed conflicted on that point, on the one hand saying that it took a lot of effort to get it to work for him while also commenting on it's ease of use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Go figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Ironically the major prelaunch concern over battery life might turn out to be much ado about nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Reviewers that mentioned it said the watch generally made it through the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Meanwhile my trip down iPhone memory lane reminded me that Apple's first smartphone was not without its own battery woes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Then there's the question of whether the Apple Watch will add distraction to our already chaotic high-tech lives or make it easier for us to stay in the moment by simply glancing at our wrists as opposed to full phone screen immersion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Personally, I think the jury's going to be out on that until users get to spend some quality time with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In contrast to analyst concerns about watch sales being a drop in the bucket compared to Apple's enormous iPhone revenues, the tech crowd is beginning to realize what I've been saying all along: the watch will sell iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>As a companion device, Apple Watch strengthens the entire iOS ecosystem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>While it appears that Apple has another category killer on its hands, the reviews serve as a good reminder of why I'm not an early adopter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Technology always improves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Give Apple time to get the kinks out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It's smarter to wait than to give in to an impulse buy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>You can be even cooler by being one of the first to get the second generation.</td></tr>
