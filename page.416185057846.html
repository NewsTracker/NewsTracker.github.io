<h3>Where They Stand: Hillary Rodham Clinton on some issues of the 2016 presidential campaign</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>As a senator and then as a presidential candidate in the 2008 race, she called for equal pay for women, increasing the minimum wage, expanding tax credits for poorer families, overhauling corporate tax provisions, expanding paid family leave and universal prekindergarten.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Clinton has been careful to avoid a divisive message, shying away from the more populist rhetoric that many in her party believe is necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The paid speeches she has given since leaving the State Department and her lament in an interview last summer about once being "dead broke" led to criticism that she does not understand the concerns of working Americans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clinton is under pressure from liberals to back plans raising taxes on the wealthiest and increase regulation of Wall Street, in part by reinstating Depression-era law repealed by her husband's administration that separated commercial from investment banking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Clinton has not taken a position on that law, though in 2007, she proposed raising taxes on income made by many investment managers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That income is taxed at the 15 percent capital gains rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>She has been supportive of policies increasing taxes on higher income families, saying in a 2010 speech that the "rich are not paying their fair share."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Liberals are also critical of her 2001 vote for a bankruptcy overhaul - backed by banks - that would have made it more difficult for consumers to get relief from debts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>She later said she regretted her vote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She has accepted hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions from U.S. companies, including Wall Street banks, for her political campaigns and philanthropic foundation, donations that make some in her party skeptical of her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>As first lady, Clinton backed the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying in 1996 that the pact was "proving its worth."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But as a presidential candidate in 2007, she called the deal "a mistake," calling for a "trade timeout" and the selection of a prosecutor to enforce current deals before entering into any new agreements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Labor unions and liberal activists are pushing Clinton to reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership, now being negotiated by the Obama administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>While Clinton has not expressed a clear opinion on the deal, she cast the agreement in more favorable terms in her memoir, "Hard Choices," writing that while it "won't be perfect" the pact "should benefit American businesses and workers."</td></tr>
