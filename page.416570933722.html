<h3>In quake-hit Nepal, rescuers struggle to recover the dead</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - For hours after Nepal was shaken by one of the most intense earthquakes here in nearly a century, 12-year-old Neha Chumda screamed for help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She had been inside her family's four-story villa in Kathmandu when the tremor struck unexpectedly Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And in the life-or-death seconds that followed - when her home swayed at its walls began cracking apart - she and 11 members of her family rushed to get outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They all made it - except Neha, who was pinned in a room between the second and third floors, which had collapsed onto of each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"She was crying for so long, we tried to help her," Transport Minister Tek Bahadur Garung said of the girl, who is the daughter of one of his cousins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The cries turned faint, then ceased by the time Nepalese army troops and security forces began trying to break through the front of the house to pry Neha out at 4 p.m. Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Then for a day and a half the soldiers used hammers, crowbars, shovels and a generator-powered saw and small jack-hammer to tear open the front of the house, then bust through the ceiling into the second floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>By Monday morning, they could see Neha's lifeless body curled up, covered in dust, a single elbow poking out above them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Then, at 10 a.m. - 42 hours after the rescue operation began - they finally pulled her out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They lowered her gently into a rainbow colored blanket that served as a makeshift stretcher, then placed her on the grassy ground outside, where four members of her family wept, their red-eyes filled with tears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We have manpower. But we don't have nearly enough equipment to do the job," Garung said of his government's rescue efforts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"We need help from every country that will give it. We need bulldozers, cranes, scaffolding, machinery."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Speaking outside the girl's home in a black tracksuit, with dozens of distraught residents looking on, Garung said: "There are a lot of dead bodies here and it's very difficult to get them out. We can't do it with crowbars" alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The estimated death toll from Nepal's earthquake soared past 4,000, and could go much higher if it turns out that vulnerable mountain villages - where information is still scarce and rescue workers are still struggling to reach - were hit hard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The catastrophe has overwhelmed Nepal's government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Garung said the Cabinet was meeting daily, but "we don't know what to do in such a situation ... this is very hard. It's a big problem. It's a mess."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although the vast majority of Kathmandu's five and 10-story buildings actually withstood the quake and still stand, many have been damaged and it's unclear whether they are still safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>On the four-lane road that runs up a hill near Neha's home, most buildings looked undamaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But half a dozen were in ruins and several multi-story apartment blocks were tilting precariously, one at a 60-degree angle.</td></tr>
