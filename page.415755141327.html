<h3>Tunisians assure Star Wars sets safe from Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) - It was a flood of messages from concerned friends abroad that alerted the president of Tunisia's Star Wars fan club that the sets of his beloved film were under attack by militants - at least according to exaggerated reports in the foreign press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a country still reeling from a terrorist attack last week on a museum that killed 21 people, a misleading report from CNN that said the iconic sets were a "way station" for the radical Islamic State group infiltrating from Libya soon went viral.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The report suggested that the sets were vulnerable after recent arrests and discoveries of weapons caches near the town of Tatouine, which lent its name to Luke Skywalker's home planet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This information is false and without foundation and doesn't reflect the reality," said Mohammed Sayem, a member of the tourism commission in the western city of Tozeur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mokhtar Hammami of the National Guard told The Associated Press he has 1,500 men, including special forces, canine units and bomb control experts under his command patrolling the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that all is normal, in fact we've seen a big influx of foreign tourists and Tunisians" in the area, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The story was picked up widely and was trending on Twitter - even though the main Star Wars sets are hundreds of miles west of Tatouine, on the other side of the country near Tozeur.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The information is totally crazy, every outlet added a bit more," said Star Wars fan Abderrahman Amer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We were obliged to reassure our friends and fans abroad that it's fine, everything is ok, the sites are protected - there was even a festival of electronic music there a few weeks ago," said Amer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"There is a world of difference between an Islamic State base and a music festival."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Concerns over security have heightened after last week's attack at the national museum that killed 21 people, including many foreigners.</td></tr>
