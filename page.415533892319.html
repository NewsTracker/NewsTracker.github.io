<h3>Police searching Houston home of millionaire Robert Durst</h3>

<tr><td>6</td><td>HOUSTON (AP) - Police on Tuesday were searching the Houston home of millionaire Robert Durst after his arrest over the weekend in New Orleans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Durst, 71, is charged with murder in a Los Angeles killing 15 years ago, and has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife in New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In 2003, he was acquitted of murder in a dismemberment death in Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>On Tuesday afternoon, a marked Houston police car and three unmarked cars were in front of a 17-story building in Houston's Rice Village neighborhood where Durst has three condominiums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>At least five plainclothes officers were working inside the guarded building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Two of the officers were seen walking to a nearby unmarked car, retrieving a small bag from the trunk and returning to the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Harris County district attorney's office spokesman Jeff McShan said the Los Angeles Police Department contacted his office last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>McShan would not elaborate on what was discussed and referred questions to the LAPD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>LAPD Sgt. Barry Montgomery, a spokesman for the department, said the department is not commenting on the case until Durst is in their custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"This is an investigation that's being handled by multi-jurisdictions," Montgomery said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"At this juncture the only thing the LAPD is doing is waiting for the extradition. We are just waiting on him to make it into our custody."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a documentary that just wrapped up about Durst's troubled life, he mumbled about how he "killed them all," providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Analysis linked a letter Durst wrote to his friend Susan Berman a year before her killing with one that pointed police to her body, and that was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him late Monday with being a felon in possession of a gun and with having marijuana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Assistant District Mark Burton said they found more than a quarter-pound of pot and a revolver in his hotel room when he was arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>It was not clear how soon he would be returned to California.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Attorney Dick DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The judge in New Orleans, Magistrate Harry Cantrell, scheduled another hearing for next Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Confronted with new evidence by the makers of a documentary about his links to three killings, the troubled millionaire blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom, still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"There it is. You're caught!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Durst whispered before the sound of running water is heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>In the documentary "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" that aired its finale Sunday on HBO, Durst is confronted with new evidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Durst blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Then he stepped away from the interview and went to the bathroom, still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next.</td></tr>
