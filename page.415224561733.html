<h3>The most beautiful but DEADLY tourist destinations around the world</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But while most trips go off without a hitch, there are some destinations where holidays can end in disaster, whether tourists are simply enjoying the beach or attempting to scale a mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But just where are the most deadly tourist destinations in the world?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>From the aptly-named Death Road in Bolivia, where hundreds of drivers die each year, to the Florida beach with more shark attacks per square kilometre than anywhere in the world, these are the beautiful destinations where tourists should be particularly careful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>With peaks of 5,000 metres high and top wind speeds on the peak reaching 95kmph it is not surprising that Mont Blanc is one of the most dangerous spot for hikers.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>In January this year six friends were killed in an avalanche that occurred on the Italian side of Mont Blanc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Many guiding companies refer to Mont Blanc as a 'long walk', and this, coupled with gondolas who take tourists up the first 9,000 ft, result in many inexperienced walkers attempting the highest mountain in Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>There have also been reports of some walkers attempting the mountain in t-shirt and shorts, unaware of the fundamental risks of Mont Blanc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There are over 4.5 million visitors to the Grand Canyon annually, which sadly claims the lives of on average 12 people a year, according to park statistics.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Last year a Texan father fell to his death, when visiting the site with his family, adding his death to the 685 that have been reported in total, to Our National Parks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Named as one of Transworld Surf's Top 10 Deadliest Waves, Teahupoo boasts waves that can range from 3 to 7 metres high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The famous waves have a unique shape, due to the shallow coral reef, which ranges up to 20 inches beneath the water's surface, being responsible for the hollow-breaking waves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>There have been five recorded deaths in the Tahiti surf since 2000, according to The Australian.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>A high profile injury occurred when local Briece Taerea when he was thrown headfirst into the reef.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>Of these, 219 attacks happen in Florida, beating famous dangerous locations such as Hawaii, Australia and South Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>New Smyrna Beach is the most dangerous beaches for this, with more attacks per square kilometre than any other beach worldwide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Thankfully not all of the incidents are fatal, and many of the injuries are caused by young bull sharks nipping at unsuspecting paddlers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Last year, a 15-year-old boy and a 29-year-old man were bitten in two separate incidents in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, on the same day, which resulted in the man having 30 stitches in his foot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Only the most intrepid explorers can attempt the last 120 metres of the Half Dome of Yosemite Valley, which is a near vertical face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Climbers must use metal cables to aid them to the top, and there have been several reported deaths in the attempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In 2011 three hikers sadly lost their lives here, two of whom were engulfed by the rapid water at the bottom.</td></tr>

<tr><td>37</td><td>It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996, due to the ancient Christian monastery on the site, which was founded at some point between the 6th and 8th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>A perilous climb of 600 stairs, that are over 1000 years old, leads up the steep sides of this rocky island, and are often slippery and highly dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>In 2009, two deaths led to a review of the safety conditions on the island, but there are still no handrails or fencing in place to assist with the ascent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Hawaii has three incredible active volcanoes, which lure helicopters of tourists wanting to see them up close in action.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>However spurts of lava have been known to reach as high as a cubic mile, and several tourists have been hit as they have flown above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Thirty people died from this in 1995, and 45 serious injuries between 1992-2002 and in 2007 they shut down the bicycle tour on Kilaluea, the most active volcano on Earth, following the deaths of three people during that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>The bike tours have since reopened, but tourists are driven to the top of the volcanoes, before getting the bikes to ride down.</td></tr>

<tr><td>48</td><td>This was an increase from in 2007, where 12 fatalities took place, along with 275 accidents and 176 injuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department blamed the high water levels on snow from above melting and affecting the water system.</td></tr>

<tr><td>55</td><td>The statistic came after a study by the Inter-American Development Bank, who proclaimed it was the World's Most Dangerous Road.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>There are no other confirmed cases of Ebola in the country, and as such Liberia can begin to count up to 42 days to be declared Ebola free in keeping with World Health Organization protocols and standards, Nyenswah said Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He challenged all Liberians to commit themselves to achieving "zero Ebola infections" by rigidly abiding by the anti-Ebola regulations.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>"People move easily over the porous borders that separate Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, so until 42 days pass without a new case in any of the three worst affected countries we need to remain vigilant."</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>Nine new cases were reported in a 24-hour period, according to an update from the Sierra Leone government on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"There is always the risk of re-infection. We're still seeing a lot of suspected and probable cases in Liberia," said Sebastian Funk, an Ebola expert at London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medecine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"Ebola was first introduced to Liberia from Guinea and I see no reason why that wouldn't happen again if it is still circulating in Guinea."</td></tr>

<tr><td>30</td><td>According to WHO data, both Guinea and Sierra Leone have recorded more than a dozen unsafe burials in the past several weeks, while Liberia hasn't reported any unsafe burials since mid-February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Unsafe burials, where friends and family members are in close contact with the body of an Ebola victim, have often sparked explosive spread of the disease during the outbreak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Liberia has also successfully traced all known contacts of Ebola cases, compared with just 49 percent for Guinea and 78 percent for Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Not being able to trace potential cases means health officials in Guinea and Sierra Leone don't know where many new cases are coming from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Resistance to Ebola containment efforts also continues to be a problem in Guinea and Sierra Leone, which have both reported numerous "security incidents" or other forms of refusal to cooperate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Since late February, Liberia has only reported just one such event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The U.N. health agency said Thursday it will start large-scale testing of an experimental Ebola vaccine in Guinea on Saturday to see how effective it might be in preventing future outbreaks of the deadly virus.</td></tr>
