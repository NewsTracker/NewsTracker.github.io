<h3>5 years of bailouts: the grim legacy of Greece's crisis</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - The sculpture shows a shabbily-dressed man slipping off what appears to be a graph, an economic index perhaps, that is crumbling under his feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>His mouth is distended in something less than a scream, more than a cry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's clearly not one of Greece's classical marbles depicting the wars and gods of old - in fact, it's the first public monument about the country's harrowing experience of economic depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The resin-and-fiberglass piece, by 22-year-old Tasos Nyfadopoulos, is named "Crisis" and speaks of a country trying to cope with a collapsing economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It is extremely important to provide a voice for the human beings behind the numbers, who have a real story to tell that goes beyond statistics," Nyfadopoulos told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The sculptor worked on the project for four years and donated it to a southern Athens municipality, where it stands beside a busy highway linking the city center with the southern beach front.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Art must turn the collective experience of the crisis into an image, so that people can remember what has happened, and question every decision that has been taken in their name without their having being consulted," Nyfadopoulos said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Wednesday marks five years since Greece voted in its first bailout deal, a day after violent popular protests left three dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The act was followed by years of turmoil in which the country tried to overhaul its economy in the midst of a downturn as brutal as the Great Depression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But after a myriad budget cuts, a million lost jobs, 250,000 closed businesses and nearly 240 billion euros ($267 billion) in rescue loans, the country is once again on the brink of default and relations with its creditors are worse than ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Moody's rating agency said Monday that Greece is, despite all its savings efforts, still the fourth riskiest sovereign bond issuer, behind Ukraine, Venezuela and Argentina, all which have either defaulted on their debt or are perilously close to doing so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>-In 2010, the bailout lenders had forecast Greece's economy would return to growth in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It only emerged from recession late last year, and is predicted to fall back into it this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>-They had predicted unemployment would ease to around 15 percent by 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Not only did it not fall, but it kept rising, peaking at around 28 percent in 2014 and currently at 26 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>-Debt was scheduled to fall to 141 percent of GDP in 2014, but it actually rose to 177 percent, even after inflicting severe losses on private bondholders in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>-An initial plan to sell off state assets aimed to raise 50 billion euros ($55.6 billion) by 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It has so far raised just 3.1 billion euros.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>One cause for the bad performance is that it is hard to cut debt at a time when the economy is shrinking, as Greece's creditors had asked it to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But successive Greek governments have also done too little, experts say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>They were too slow to change the way the economy and political system work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Because the public sector was spared cost cuts, the private sector suffered the burden of recession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Greece's Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research think tank noted in a report that the country made significant progress in healing public finances between 2010 and 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But that progress petered out late last year, when early elections were called for January.</td></tr>
