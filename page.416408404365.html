<h3>Baltimore mayor says still questions on death in police custody</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(Reuters) - Baltimore's mayor promised on Tuesday officials would conduct a thorough, transparent investigation to answer questions about the death of a black man in police custody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told CNN that she had no interest in hiding information about the death of Freddie Gray, 27, and that she would ensure that information is made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We still have questions. We still don't know exactly what happened," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gray was arrested by white officers on April 12 and died on Sunday after slipping into a coma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A preliminary autopsy report said he died from a spinal injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His death is the latest incident to raise questions about the treatment of minorities by U.S. police and has sparked protests in the largely black city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Six officers have been suspended in the incident, much of which was captured on a surveillance camera and a bystander's cellphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rawlings-Blake said that when Gray was put into a police van to be transported to a station, he was dragged by officers but was able to use his legs to get in the vehicle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"So we know that he was able bodied when he was in the van and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van, he was unresponsive," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We know that he asked for medical attention. We know that medical attention was not immediately requested for him. We know that was a mistake."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told a news conference on Monday that a police investigation would be concluded by May 1 and the results turned over to state prosecutors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The investigation itself would undergo an outside review, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Rawlings-Blake, who is black, said Baltimore had a "very challenging history" regarding police misconduct and brutality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"I'm fighting to bring back the trust between the police and the community," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Spurred by the death, Baltimore police are instituting training and reforms on transporting suspects and their medical treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a separate review of complaints about Baltimore police, at Batts' request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It followed a Baltimore Sun newspaper investigation that found the city had paid almost $6 million since 2011 to settle more than 100 lawsuits alleging police brutality and other misconduct.</td></tr>
