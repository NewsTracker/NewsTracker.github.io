<h3>World Health Organization approves 1st quick test for Ebola</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (AP) - The World Health Organization said Friday it has approved a quick test for Ebola that will dramatically cut the time it takes to determine - with reasonable accuracy - whether someone is infected with the deadly virus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit, made by Colorado-based Corgenix, met sufficient quality, safety and performance requirements to allow it to be purchased and distributed by U.N. agencies and aid groups, WHO said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It may definitely help the response. I wouldn't say it's a game-changer," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO's assistant director-general.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Until now, Ebola tests have been mainly conducted in laboratories.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>These gene-based tests are more accurate but can take between 12 and 24 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The new test can provide results within 15 minutes by detecting an Ebola protein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In trials it correctly identified 92 percent of the patients with Ebola and 85 percent of those not infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Medical personnel will still need to conduct a backup test when someone tests negative, said Aylward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"But (the new test) might help us get to zero faster."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Almost 24,000 people have been infected and nearly 9,400 people have died from the current Ebola outbreak, which began in West Africa over a year ago.</td></tr>
