<h3>Ford to spend $2.5 billion on plants in Mexico, angering UAW</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Ford logo is pictured at the Ford Motor Co plant in Genk December 17, 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Friday it will spend $2.5 billion to build a new generation of fuel-efficient engines and transmissions in Mexico, creating 3,800 jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The United Auto Workers union, in response, said putting jobs in Mexico rather than the United States will be a major issue at its upcoming U.S. labor talks with Ford, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The UAW president, Dennis Williams, said Ford's announcement is "disappointing, but not any more disappointing than GM's decision to invest $5 billion in Mexico," or those made by all six of the top-selling automakers in the U.S. market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The companies are drawn to Mexico for its proximity to the lucrative U.S. market as well as lower worker pay than at U.S. plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The draw of Mexico complicates the UAW's effort to raise worker pay and keep jobs at U.S. plants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ford said its investment, made in its 90th year in Mexico, is a way to keep the company competitive with other global automakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ford said it will build a new engine facility within its engine plant in the northern state of Chihuahua.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The facility will build a new gasoline engine that will be exported to the United States, Canada, South America and the Asia-Pacific region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Production of Ford's I-4 and diesel engines at the Chihuahua plant will also be expanded, making it the biggest engine plant in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The company said it will also build a transmission plant in the central state of Guanajuato, in partnership with German transmission maker Getrag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ford's announcement, confirming an earlier Reuters report, is the latest in a recent series of auto investments in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Earlier this week, Toyota Motor Corp announced it would spend $1 billion for its first passenger car plant in Mexico, and last month, Volkswagen said it would invest $1 billion to expand its plant in Mexico's Puebla state.</td></tr>
