<h3>Israel's Netanyahu races to form narrow coalition government</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was racing against the clock Wednesday to put together a governing coalition or else face an almost unimaginable scenario by which he would be forced out of office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Netanyahu was holding furious consultations with the hawkish Jewish Home Party in order to secure a narrow 61-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If he fails by the end of the day, President Reuven Rivlin must appoint someone else the task of forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After Netanyahu's Likud Party won March 17 elections with 30 seats, it seemed he would have a relatively easy time forming a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>But talks stalled this week when Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman unexpectedly stepped down and announced his secular nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party was joining the opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>That left Netanyahu dependent on Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett, a former aide who has a rocky relationship with Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Netanyahu has secured deals with three partners controlling 53 seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>They include Kulanu, a centrist party focused on economic issues, and two ultra-Orthodox religious parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Fuming over the deals giving ultra-Orthodox parties ministerial power over religious services, Bennett is driving a hard bargain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Slated to serve as education minister, Bennett is now demanding the job of justice minister for a party member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Jewish Home party is linked to the West Bank settler movement and unlikely to push for Netanyahu's ouster, a move that could open a potential path to government of the more dovish Zionist Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even if, as expected, they reach a deal, Netanyahu would have a thin majority, leaving him vulnerable to extortion from any individual coalition lawmaker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A narrow coalition would have a difficult time passing economic reforms favored by Kulanu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It also would be averse to Palestinian peace moves and likely favor expanded settlement construction, putting it on a collision course with the international community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Likud officials concede such a government would not be effective or last long, raising speculation that Netanyahu will ultimately reach out to the Zionist Union and its leader, Isaac Herzog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He insists on serving as the opposition leader.</td></tr>
