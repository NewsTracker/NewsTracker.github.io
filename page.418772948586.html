<tr><td>4</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Two independent government investigators have asked the Justice Department to look into whether sensitive government information was transmitted through Hillary Rodham Clinton's personal email server, federal officials said Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A Justice Department official confirmed that the department had received a criminal referral from the inspectors general of the State Department, where Clinton served for four years, and of the federal intelligence agencies.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>The officials were not authorized to discuss the referral by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Clinton in March acknowledged her use of a personal email account, which she said she had done as a matter of convenience and to limit the number of electronic devices she used.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>The Clinton campaign on Friday that she "followed appropriate practices in dealing with classified materials."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Any released emails deemed classified by the administration have been done so after the fact, and not at the time they were transmitted," campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement.</td></tr>
