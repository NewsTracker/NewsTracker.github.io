<h3>Boston Marathon bombing trial begins</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Tsarnaev, 21, appeared before the US District Court in Boston on Wednesday - and his lawyer immediately told the jury he was guilty of taking part in the bombing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"It was him," defence attorney Judy Clarke said of Tsarnaev.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Laying out an argument clearly aimed at saving Tsarnaev from the death penalty, Clarke said the defence will not try to "sidestep" his guilt for the "senseless, horribly misguided acts carried out by two brothers".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"The evidence will not establish and we will not argue that Tamerlan put a gun to Dzhokhar's head or that he forced him to join in the plan, but you will hear evidence about the kind of influence that this older brother had," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Tamerlan died in a shootout with police days after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>About two dozen victims, including some who lost limbs in the attack, took up the entire left side of the courtroom.</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 were hurt when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line seconds apart on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Prosecutors say Dzhokhar was an equal participant who acted of his own free will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He faces 30 charges in the bombings and the shooting death days later of a police officer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Seventeen of the charges carry the possibility of the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Man arrested for possessing rice cooker near Boston Marathon finish line during anniversary tribute to bombing victims.</td></tr>

<h3>Mexico police arrest Trevino, Zetas cartel chief</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The crime boss was caught in a predawn raid in San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy suburb of the northern city of Monterrey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>On Wednesday, Mexican police and soldiers arrested Omar Trevino Morales, the public face of the Zetas cartel, giving embattled President Enrique Pena Nieto his second capture of a kingpin in less than a week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Members of the army and the federal police caught the gang boss, known as "Z-42," without firing a shot near the northern city of Monterrey, unnamed senior government officials told news agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Authorities from Mexico and the US blame the Zetas for several atrocities carried out by gangs in a wave of violence that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mexico offered a reward of 30 million pesos (1.8 million euros/$2 million) for Trevino's capture on weapons and organized crime charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The US Drug Enforcement Administration offered $5 million (4.5 million euros) for Trevino's capture on drug-trafficking charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The DEA had believed him responsible for several abductions and murders committed in the border city of Nuevo Laredo between 2005 and 2006 and supplying multikilogram loads of cocaine smuggled in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In 2013, authorities arrested the kingpin's brother, Miguel Angel Trevino, or "Z-40," described as the most brutal Zetas capo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>About a year before that, Mexico's military had killed the cartel's other biggest leader, Heriberto "El Lazca" Lazcano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Z-40's arrest and the gunning down of Lazcano had severely weakened the gang.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Founded by elite army deserters in 1999, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, based along the border with Texas and one of the oldest organized crime groups in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But the group struck out on its own in early 2010, setting off the most violent phase in the country's drug war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Incidents pinned on the Zetas include the 2010 massacre of 72 migrant workers, an arson attack on a Monterrey casino in 2011 that killed 52 people and the dumping of 49 decapitated bodies near the same city in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Authorities also say that the Zetas melted their enemies in a barrel of "stew."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Trevino's arrest follows the capture in a firefight of Servando "La Tuta" Gomez, a former teacher and the leader of the Knights Templar drug gang - until his arrest in the southwestern state of Michoacan last Friday, the most wanted capo still at large in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In October, police captured the leader of the Juarez Cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The arrests bring to a total of 91 the number of members of criminal organizations detained or incapacitated since President Pena Nieto announced his objective in December 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Thirty-one names remain on the president's to-catch list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Mexican federal police have nabbed Servando Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug cartel and one of the country's most wanted fugitives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He is the fourth drug boss from the group to be taken down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>A German federal commissioner has apologized over the apparent use of German weapons in the case of 43 missing Mexican students, believed murdered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Christoph Strasser visited the students' college.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Mexico refuses to quiet down, with mass demonstrations on the anniversary of the revolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But it should not quiet down until it's true democracy, says DW's Claudia Herrera-Pahl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Mexican police have arrested the alleged head of the Juarez drug gang, whose cartel was engaged in a bloody border turf war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Vincente Carrillo Fuentes, the latest "capo" to fall, had taken control from his late brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>A new policy in the war on drugs appears to be having the desired effect in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The murder rate is dropping, but despite a return to pre-2010 levels it's still too early to declare victory over the drug cartels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>In the state of Guerrero, a leftist Mexican mayoral candidate has been found decapitated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Aide Nava was believed to have been kidnapped by a band of criminals on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Drug wars: Where is Mexico headed?</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Mexican authorities have captured yet another big fish among drug cartel leaders: Omar Trevino, alias "Z-42."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>His arrest could trigger new gang rivalries.</td></tr>
