<h3>EU appeals to nations to live up to asset pledges for migrant operations in Greece, Hungary</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BRUSSELS - The European Union is appealing to its member countries to live up to pledges to provide planes and other assets to its border agency Frontex so it can cope with a migrant influx into Greece and Hungary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>EU migration spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said Friday that "if we don't get these assets, it would seriously undermine Frontex's ability to carry out its operations."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>EU leaders committed in April to triple the agency's budget and provide it with more assets as thousands of people fleeing conflict and poverty converged on Europe in search of better lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>More than 2,000 migrants have died this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many countries pledged assets for short-term use, but Bertaud says Frontex needs more planes and "technical assistance" like personnel and patrol cars for Greece and Hungary.</td></tr>
