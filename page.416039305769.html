<h3>Bust of Edward Snowden sneaked into, removed from NYC park</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Suddenly, in the middle of the New York night, Edward Snowden's face appeared - deep in a public park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A 4-foot-high, 100-pound sculpted bust of the whistleblower now exiled in Russia was sneaked into Brooklyn's Fort Greene Park on Monday before dawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Animal New York, a city news website that first reported the incident, said the mysterious perpetrators were a small group of artists - admirers of the former contractor who had leaked classified information from the National Security Agency to the media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The activists hoisted the bust to the top of a Revolutionary War memorial, adding his name to a column, according to Animal New York.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Snowden's artistic appearance was short-lived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>At daybreak, police said city parks officials ordered the sculpted Snowden removed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>And by evening, his bust was being held at Brooklyn's 88th Precinct pending an investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The idea for the tribute was conceived by two New York City-based artists, joined by a West Coast sculptor, Animal New York said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In a statement to the online outlet, they said they had "updated" the memorial to American POWs who died during the Revolutionary War "to highlight those who sacrifice their safety in the fight against modern-day tyrannies. It would be a dishonor to those memorialized here to not laud those who protect the ideals they fought for, as Edward Snowden has by bringing the NSA's 4th-Amendment-violating surveillance programs to light."</td></tr>
