<h3>Florida State rusher suspended, charged with punching woman (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(AP) -- Florida State indefinitely suspended leading running back Dalvin Cook after he was charged Friday with punching a woman outside a downtown bar - the second time in two weeks that an FSU player has been charged with punching a woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The incident happened June 23 after the popular bar closed at 2 a.m. A witness told police a group of football players began arguing with the alleged victim after one suggested taking her home and having sex and she refused, saying she had a boyfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The woman, Madison Geohegan, told police that during the argument Florida State wide receiver Travis Rudolph came too close to her and she pushed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At that point, Cook stepped in, asked her why she pushed Rudolph and began swinging at her, she told police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cook was restrained by friends, but while held back punched Geohegan in the face, she told police.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Police said she had swelling and a bleeding lip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She identified Cook through a photographic lineup.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>State Attorney Willie Meggs interviewed Geohegan and Cook before issuing the arrest warrant on a misdemeanor battery charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Police are giving Cook the option of turning himself in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He denied striking the woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cook, 19, led Florida State last year with 1,008 rushing yards as a freshman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was also second on the team with eight touchdowns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cook rushed for 177 yards and a touchdown and caught five passes for 43 yards in Florida State's 37-35 victory over Georgia Tech to win the ACC championship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He also rushed for 103 yards in Florida State's 59-20 loss to Oregon in the Rose Bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Cook is 5-feet-11-inches tall and 200 pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Geohegan is 5-feet-4-inches tall and weighs 140 pounds, according to a police report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It's the second time in two weeks that an FSU player has been charged with punching a woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Freshman quarterback De'Andre Johnson was caught on a surveillance video punching a woman at another bar near campus on June 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He was suspended after being charged the next day and kicked off the team earlier this week when the video was made public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Johnson, however, had yet to play a game for Florida State, while Cook has been expected to be a key to the team's offense this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>''We spend a good deal of time educating our student-athletes about appropriate behavior and their responsibilities as representatives of Florida State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The majority of our players are exemplary, but clearly we must place an even stronger emphasis on this,'' coach Jimbo Fisher said in a statement released by the school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''I remain committed to educating our young men and holding them accountable for their actions,'' Fisher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>''We will do better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>University President John Thrasher said he has asked Fisher and the school's athletics director to develop a plan to help the school's athlete's understand the consequences of their actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''This will include Coach Fisher meeting immediately with his team to reiterate, in no uncertain terms, our expectations of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>I also plan to meet with the team, and we will be asking professionals who deal with these matters, including State Attorney Willie Meggs, to speak with them,'' Thrasher said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>A phone number for Cook was not immediately available, and it was unclear if he has a lawyer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Geohegan didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.</td></tr>
