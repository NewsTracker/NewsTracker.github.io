<h3>Police blame Danish native in terror spree</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>He has been identified in several Danish media outlets on Sunday as Omar El-Hussein.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ekstra-Bladet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Copenhagen: After killing a Danish film director in a Saturday afternoon attack on a Copenhagen cafe and then a Danish Jew on night guard at a synagogue, the 22-year-old gunman responsible for Denmark's worst burst of terrorism in decades unleashed a final fusillade outside a four-story apartment building before dawn Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Cornered by the police in a narrow street near the railway station in Norrebro, a heavily immigrant, shabby-chic district of Denmark's capital, the Danish-born attacker opened fire and was killed in a burst of return fire, the police said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Police officers control the street in front of an internet cafe in Norrebro district in Copenhagen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>His body fell face up on the sidewalk, said Soren Krebs, 22, an economics student who lives in the adjacent building, and it left a pool of blood that was hosed away Sunday by the fire department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"My first feeling was just panic," Krebs recalled, adding that he initially thought the gunfire was a battle between drug dealers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In Denmark, he said, "the first thing that comes to mind is not terrorism. This is not a problem we have had to think about much."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>After a January rampage in the Paris area killed 17 people, and police raids in Belgium a week later that authorities said thwarted a major terrorist operation, during the weekend Denmark became the latest European country plunged into what Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt described Sunday as "a fight for freedom against a dark ideology."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Police technicians work next to the door to Krudttoenden in Oesterbro, Copenhagen, February 15, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>While the gunman's name and basic biographical details were unclear Sunday, he appears to have shared some traits with at least two of the militants responsible for the Paris violence, notably a criminal record and an abrupt transition from petty crime to Islamic militancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Danish news media identified him as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, but the Copenhagen police did not confirm his name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>They identified him only as a 22-year-old, born and raised in Denmark, whom they knew for gang-related activity and for several criminal offenses linked to weapons violations and violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>A Copenhagen police statement issued in November 2013 asked for help in finding a suspect by the same name who was wanted at the time in connection with a stabbing on a commuter train.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The police had noted that the suspect "should be considered dangerous."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Police working at the scene where police shot and killed the alleged shooter in Copenhagen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Shooting took place early Sunday morning close to Noerrebro commuter station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Police have since charged two people with aiding the man suspected of the shootings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Two men who were detained on Sunday were charged the following day with helping through advice and deeds the perpetrator in relation to the shootings at Krudttonden and in Krystalgade, police said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>During the weekend, Thorning-Schmidt warned the usually placid nation - whose 5.6 million citizens regularly rank in opinion surveys as among the world's happiest people - that "if a madman is willing to sacrifice his life, then we will never be able to guard ourselves 100 per cent."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Danish police officers secure the area outside of a synagogue on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Heavily armed police officers were out in force across Copenhagen, the Danish capital, Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>While authorities said the gunman appeared to be acting alone, police officers raided a number of homes and other places, including an Internet cafe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In the Norrebro district, a search of the gunman's apartment uncovered an automatic weapon, the spokesman said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The attacker was carrying two guns - including the weapon apparently used to kill the director and Jewish security guard - when he was shot early Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Awoken by a burst of gunfire shortly after 5am, Krebs said, he looked out of his ground-floor bedroom to witness a shootout "like in a movie" and then crawled next door to the room of a fellow student, Casper Dam, who had been out late drinking and was asleep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The two men took refuge in a bathroom away from the street.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A street camera captures a man police suspect to be the gunman at a freedom of speech event in Copenhagen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Jens Madsen, the chief of Denmark's domestic security agency, said there was no indication the gunman had travelled to Syria or Iraq as a jihadi fighter or had any connection to the two French-born brothers who attacked the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on January 7 or a third Frenchman who, two days later, seized a Paris kosher supermarket and killed shoppers there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>But Madsen, speaking to reporters at Copenhagen's Police Headquarters on Sunday, said it was possible that the city's attacks had been "inspired" by the Paris bloodshed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>While most Danes responded with shock to the weekend shootings, the country's security services have been on alert against Islamic extremism since 2005, when the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten published 12 cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and, several months later, a Copenhagen mosque sent a mission to the Middle East to rally hostility against Denmark.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Danish diplomatic missions were attacked, and Danish businesses boycotted across the Muslim world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>In an editorial to be published Monday, Jyllands Posten said, "Unfortunately, it is difficult to claim surprise at the attacks in Copenhagen."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Terrorism, it added, is "not a question of if but when."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Kurt Westergaard, who drew a cartoon for the newspaper that showed Muhammad with a bomb in a black turban, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 2010, fleeing into a safe room at his home in the port city of Aarhus to escape a young Somali armed with an axe and a knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In 2013, Lars Hedegaard, an outspoken critic of Islam and a defender of Lars Vilks, the Swedish cartoonist who appeared to have been targeted at the cafe Saturday, was shot at outside his Copenhagen home by a gunman disguised as a postal worker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>The weekend violence, however, still represented the worst terrorism to hit Denmark since the 1980s, when left-wing extremists killed a police officer in the capital and still-unidentified extremists planted bombs near a Copenhagen synagogue and the offices of a US airline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>In its response to the threat since the cartoon crisis, the authorities have combined extensive surveillance of suspected militants and of radical mosques with efforts to "rehabilitate," rather than punish, young Muslims who dabble in extremism but have not yet been implicated in criminal actions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>While most European governments have sought to arrest or expel residents who have returned home after waging jihad in Syria and Iraq, for example, the city of Aarhus has set up a counselling program to help them reintegrate into society.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Like the Paris gunmen, the 22-year-old responsible for the weekend's killings in Copenhagen was born in the country he sought to terrorise, into a Muslim immigrant family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>He had a criminal record, and Danish TV2 television said that he had been released from prison just weeks earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>His first attack took place Saturday afternoon when he sprayed bullets into the cafe where Vilks, who had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, was speaking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>That attack killed one man, identified by the Danish media as Finn Norgaard, 55, a director.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Three police officers were wounded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Vilks, who was attending a meeting on freedom of speech, was not hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The gunman then fled by car, and the vehicle was later found abandoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Video footage from surveillance cameras showed the suspect talking into a cell phone, apparently to order a taxi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>He then took a cab to Mjolnerparken, an area of Norrebro, where surveillance cameras caught him entering a housing compound and leaving 20 minutes later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>He then reappeared, according to the police, shortly before 1am Sunday at a synagogue in the centre of the city, opening fire on the police and security guards, one of whom was killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Dan Rosenberg Asmussen, a leader of Denmark's Jewish community, said that the victim at the synagogue was a young Jewish man who was guarding a building adjacent to the synagogue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>He said that about 80 people were inside the synagogue at the time celebrating a bat mitzvah and that the police had been asked to provide protection after the cafe shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Denmark's chief rabbi, Jair Melchior, identified the victim as Dan Uzan, 37, a long-time security guard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Soren Esperson, deputy chairman of the Danish People's Party, a right-wing populist party, said the attack "looks very much like a copycat action."</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>"It has the same targets as in Paris: a cartoonist, Jews and the police," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>A loud critic of immigration, Esperson's party has surged in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Esperson derided pleas from leading mainstream politicians, including the prime minister, that Islam not be blamed for the violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>"Of course this has something to do with Islam just as the Spanish Inquisition, the Crusades and witch-burning had something to do with Christianity," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Christianity, he added, had "dealt with its fanatics" and Islam "must now do the same."</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Muslim organisations in Denmark condemned the attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>The Islamic Religious Community, an umbrella organisation, denounced what it called a "wrong action" and also called on the Danish authorities to "show their solidarity with all, including Muslims, who will undoubtedly be the next victims in daily life."</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Meanwhile, the authorities and residents in the neighbourhood where the gunman lived are scrambling to learn how a petty criminal seemingly turned into a violent zealot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>Mohammud Awil, who has lived in Mjolnerparken since emigrating from Somalia 26 years ago, blamed extremist self-declared preachers who "pick on young people who drink or use drugs because they are very weak."</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Awil, a bus driver, said he knew several families whose Danish-born children had gone to fight in Somalia or the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Thorning-Schmidt sought to calm tensions after the attacks, saying, "This is not a war between Islam and the West."</td></tr>

<h3>Bali Nine's Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to be moved to Nusakambangan island this week, authorities say</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two Australian Bali Nine members on death row in Indonesia will be transferred this week to the most notorious prison on Nusakambangan island, known as Indonesia's Alcatraz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The head of the Bali prosecutors' office confirmed on Monday afternoon that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be taken to the maximum security Batu prison on the penal island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The name of the jail, which was built in 1925, means stone prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ten officers from the paramilitary force Brimob will escort the two men to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Momock Bambang Samiarso said the transfer would not take place on Monday - and was unlikely to happen on Tuesday - but would definitely happen this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mr Samiarso said he would notify the families as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed on Monday he made a further plea for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's lives to Indonesian President Joko Widodo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And a judge involved in handing down the death sentence to the two drug smugglers has denied allegations there was political intervention or bribery in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Attorney-General spokesman Tony Spontana said earlier that condemned drug felons from Bali's infamous Kerobokan jail, where Chan and Sukumaran are on death row, will be the first transferred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>They would be later joined by felons from prisons in Madiun and Yogyakarta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Only after everybody is gathered at Nusakambangan will the D-day be decided," Mr Spontana said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Eleven prisoners on death row for drug and murder charges are expected to be killed in the second round of executions in Indonesia this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Of these, seven drug felons are foreigners from Australia, the Philippines, France, Brazil, Nigeria and Ghana.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mr Abbott said he felt "sick in the pit of my stomach" when he thought about what was happening to Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Mr Abbott would not provide further information on his overtures to Mr Joko because he did not want it to come down to a test of strength.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"If we do turn this into a test of strength, I think we are much more likely to back the Indonesians into a corner than to get the result we want," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Chan and Sukumaran's legal team have written to the Indonesian judicial committee requesting an investigation into allegations of political interference and bribery when the death sentence was imposed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said these were very serious allegations and she understood the lawyers would continue to raise these matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However a judge involved in the case, Wayan Yasa Abadi, denied there had been political interference or bribes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said he would respond if summonsed by the judicial committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Meanwhile, a new Lowy Institute poll has found that 62 per cent of Australians oppose the execution of Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>This is in contrast to an earlier Roy Morgan poll - seized upon by the Indonesian government to justify the executions - which found that 52 per cent supported the death penalty for Australian drug traffickers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The earlier poll was criticised for being crude and misleading due to the rubbery nature of the questions asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>According to the Lowy poll, 69 per cent of the population do not believe the death penalty should be applied for drug trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Executive director of the Lowy Institute Michael Fullilove said Australian public and political opposition was crystallising as the date of the execution drew closer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>August, 2005: Indonesian police - acting on information passed onto them by the Australian Federal Police - arrest nine Australians at Denpasar airport for attempting to smuggle heroin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>September, 2006: Prime Minister John Howard refuses to intervene on behalf of the "Bali Nine".</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"There are still matters potentially to be heard before Indonesian courts," he said at the time, claiming he did not want to jeopardise the defendants' case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>July, 2007: Mr Howard raises the issue with Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono: "I thought it was appropriate to mention the fact that it's an issue that attracts a lot of interest in Australia."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>December: Prime minister Kevin Rudd tells Mr Yudhoyono that if any of the Bali Nine still faced the death penalty when all legal avenues had been pursued, he would plead for clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>August, 2010: Letter from the AFP is submitted to the Indonesian court, stating Scott Rush only played a minor role in the drug-smuggling ring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>AFP commissioner Mick Keelty also testifies in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Mr Rush's death sentence is reduced to life in prison.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>May, 2013: Foreign affairs minister Bob Carr defends the government's handling of the Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran cases "We urge them to grant the clemency appeals but we do so having respect with Indonesia to make its own laws."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Mr Carr says he has spoken about the matter with his Indonesian counterpart at their meetings, as had prime minister Julia Gillard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>January 17, 2015: Prime Minister Tony Abbott writes directly to Indonesian President Joko Widodo for mercy regarding Chan and Sukumaran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>January 20: Mr Abbott renews direct appeal for clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>February 6: Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop and Mr Abbott say the government is doing "whatever [it] humanly can" behind the scenes to keep the pair alive, while considering recalling the Australian ambassador to Indonesia if Chan and Sukumaran are executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>February 12: Ms Bishop and Shadow Foreign Minister Tanya Plibersek both address parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Bishop says 11 written representations have been made since January 7, from the Prime Minister, the Governor-General, the Foreign Minister, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>She says she has spoken to her Indonesian counterpart "many times".</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>More than 55 personal representations at the ministerial and prime ministerial levels have been made.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>February 14: Ms Bishop warns on radio that Australian tourists may choose to boycott Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>February 16: Mr Abbott tells media he has personally reiterated his concerns to Mr Widodo.</td></tr>
