<h3>U.S. considers ways to sidestep Netanyahu after he raises doubts he would ever accept Palestinian state</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro said on Israeli radio Sunday that if it's impossible to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians as long as Mr. Netanyahu is prime minister, the question arises "what other steps can be taken to continue in the right direction of attaining two states for two peoples."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Mr. Netanyahu said the day before Israel's March 17 election that there would be no Palestinian state if he returned to office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>After winning the vote he softened his stance, saying he wanted a two-state solution but "circumstances have to change."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The official process of forming a new government began on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>President Barack Obama's administration has signalled it may reconsider its policy of siding with Israel in votes at the United Nations Security Council, where the U.S. frequently blocks resolutions opposed by Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Despite calls by Reuven Rivlin, Israel's president, to begin a "healing process" following the bitterly contested election, Mr. Obama refused to allow Mr. Netanyahu to take back comments ruling out a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership," Mr. Obama said in an interview, reiterating that his administration would now "evaluate what other options are available."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr. Obama's remarks reflected deep anger in the administration at Mr. Netanyahu's comments apparently ruling out a two-state solution, as well as his racially charged warning to the Israeli Right that Israeli Arabs were voting "in droves."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We indicated that that kind of rhetoric was contrary to what is the best of Israel's traditions," Mr. Obama told The Huffington Post in an interview published Saturday, arguing that Mr. Netanyahu's remarks had undermined the fabric of Israeli democracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mr. Obama rejected public attempts by Mr. Netanyahu to clarify his position in a series of television interviews in which the Israeli prime minister said he was merely observing that a two-state solution was not viable in the current conditions, rather than ruling it out in principle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Even Mr. Netanyahu's allies expressed concern about the depth of the rift now separating the Israeli and U.S. leaders and the potential damage to a relationship that has provided a cornerstone of the Middle East for more than 60 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"If the Americans are finding it difficult to understand or accept our clarifications, this is certainly worrying and requires tending to," said Yuval Steinitz, Israel's strategic affairs minister, and a close Netanyahu ally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On the Israeli left, Amos Yadlin, a former chief of Israeli military intelligence aligned with Zionist Union party, which lost the vote to Mr. Netanyahu, warned that Israel would "pay a price" for Mr. Netanyahu's position on Palestinian statehood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"They used a word that they haven't used since 1975 - a 'reassessment' of relations," Mr. Yadlin said after a visit to Washington.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He predicted that while Mr. Obama would stop short of sanctions, life would be "much harder" for Israel in the diplomatic arena.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The U.S. vetoes at the UN Security Council were "predicated on this idea that the two-state solution is the best outcome," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"Now our ally in these talks has said that they are no longer committed to that solution. That means we need to reevaluate our position."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The U.S. has helped to block Security Council resolutions condemning Israeli activities such as settlement building in the West Bank, and ensure the UN body withholds recognition of a Palestinian state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It has also opposed efforts to file complaints over alleged Israeli war crimes to the International Criminal Court, which the Palestinians will join on April 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mr. Shapiro said the U.S. has "not yet reached any decisions" about its new course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Republican Senator John McCain said Israel's election was "free and fair" and urged Mr. Obama to work with Mr. Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"Get over your temper tantrum, Mr. President - it's time we work together with our Israeli friends" against Islamist groups in the region, Mr. McCain said on CNN.</td></tr>
