<h3>Apple Watch delivery slowed by faulty part, report says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple Watches are displayed at an Apple Inc. store in New York, U.S., on Friday, April 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Shipments of the highly anticipated watch are reportedly being slowed by a faulty component manufactured by one of Apple's suppliers in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Shipments of the highly anticipated Apple Watch are reportedly being slowed by a faulty component manufactured by one of Apple's suppliers in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Wall Street Journal said the problem centers on a part called the taptic engine, a component designed to mimic being tapped on the wrist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The engine powers a small rod back and forth to alert users in lieu of a vibration or a ringer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Apple discovered that some taptic engines supplied by AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. in the southern factory hub of Shenzhen began to falter, according to the Journal report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Watches with the broken parts were being scrapped and Apple is hoping to increase production at the company's second supplier, Nidec Corp. of Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Apple is also looking at adding new suppliers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, the report said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple told the Los Angeles Times it won't comment on "rumor and speculation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The setback complicates the rollout of the Apple Watch, which is only being offered online and in a handful of special boutiques.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It is not available in Apple retail stores, the result of limited supplies and the need to market the watch differently from other Apple products.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Apple Watch is also our most personal product yet, with multiple case and band options because it's an object of self-expression," wrote Angela Ahrendts, Apple's head of retail, in a memo to employees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Given the high interest and initial supply at launch, we will be able to get customers the model they want earlier and faster by taking orders online."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Analysts expect Apple to sell between eight and 10 million watches in the first year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A problem with the watch's components would follow a supplier issue with Apple's larger-screened iPhone 6 and 6 Plus introduced last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The phones were expected to have display screens made of sapphire, but Apple's supplier GT Advanced couldn't meet the requirements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The supplier filed for bankruptcy in October.</td></tr>
