<h3>Artist mad Clinton portrait with Lewinsky reference isn't on display</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Artist Nelson Shanks works on a portrait of former president Bill Clinton in his Andalusia, Pa., studio in 2005.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Monica Lewinsky's scandalous blue dress is casting a shadow once again -- this time on the shelf life of a presidential portrait, alleges its artist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nelson Shanks recently attracted media attention for saying a portrait he painted of President Bill Clinton for the National Portrait Gallery includes a subtle reference to Monica Lewinsky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The reason for the headline-grabbing revelation?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Shanks said he is frustrated the painting is not on public display in the museum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Shanks tells the USA TODAY Network that he believes the picture, which includes a subtle shadow cast by a blue dress, was removed because of pressure from the Clinton family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, an intern in the White House at the time, was a "primary scandal" during Clinton's presidency, Shanks says, and he wanted to allude to that in the piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Maybe (the painting) doesn't look as formal as they wanted," he says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I rather doubt that they got the Lewinsky angle. I was never going to mention it to anyone, but with the tremendous mistreatment on my part in that it's been spirited away, I felt this was a good stimulus to open a conversation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The National Portrait Gallery commonly rotates through exhibits and sometimes work is removed from public view for a period of time, Bethany Bentley, a spokesperson for the museum told the USA TODAY Network.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"It was not taken off view because of any outside requests," Bentley said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The gallery has space for 900 works to be displayed at any one time out of a collection of more than 22,000 items, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The gallery unveiled the portrait to the public in 2006 and it hung on and off through August of 2009.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In 2011, it was on loan for a traveling display in Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The gallery does not have any future rotations scheduled right now, according to Bentley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's been cycled right down to the storage area permanently," Shanks said about the painting's more-than-five-year hiatus from the gallery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Shanks sees himself as a biographer and said his portraits capture the subject's personality and story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>For Clinton, that meant portraying the 42nd president in a casual pose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"In the presidency, [Clinton] had a certain amount of panache, a little bit of swagger. He didn't stand nor act like a mannequin. That swagger and that sense of self was very present and I tried to get exactly that in the painting," Shanks said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Another undeniable part of his legacy is Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I felt it necessary to depart from complete naivete in the painting and put in a subtle, subtle shadow across his presidency," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>To get the right effect, Shanks says he went through various props for something to cast the shadow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>That's when he happened upon a blue dress and decided it was fitting since Lewinsky's blue dress, which had DNA that matched Clinton's, became a central part of the scandal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A photo taken by USA TODAY in 2005 shows Shanks in his studio working on the painting with a blue dress hanging on coat rack casting a shadow onto the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>With a replica of the fireplace in the Oval Office set up in his studio, artist Nelson Shanks works on a portrait of former president Bill Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There is a blue dress set up in the studio casting a shadow on the set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Shanks recently told reporters that the shadow represents Monica Lewinsky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Shanks said the decision to talk about the Lewinsky reference at this time has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton possibly running for president in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"I've spent quite a bit of time with her and I like her," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A spokesperson for the Clinton family could not immediately be reached for comment.</td></tr>

<h3>Final jury to be chosen in Boston Marathon bombing trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>But starting Wednesday, a day after a jury was selected, the focus will shift dramatically from the legal process to the harsh reality of what happened that day: the explosions, the screams, the chaos and the blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prosecutors are expected to present graphic images of the carnage caused by the bombs, including a surveillance video that authorities say shows Tsarnaev placing a backpack just feet from 8-year-old Martin Richard and his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The boy died in the explosion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The bombs set April 15, 2013, killed three people and injured more than 260.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At least 16 people lost limbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"When people start streaming into that courthouse - many with missing limbs - and the prosecutors get up off their chairs and start talking about this again, people are going to relive the enormity and the awful nature of this," said Gerry Leone, a former state and federal prosecutor who led the prosecution of shoe bomber Richard Reid but is not involved in the Tsarnaev case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"It wouldn't surprise me to see the young boy's parents as the first witnesses. Oftentimes, in a homicide case, you humanize the victims right away, and you're brought right back to that day," Leone said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A blast from the second bomb killed Martin and tore off his 7-year-old sister's left leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Lingzi Lu, 23, a Boston University graduate student, was also killed by that blast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Krystal Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager from Medford, was killed by the first bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Authorities say Tsarnaev, then 19, and his older brother, Tamerlan, 26- ethnic Chechens who had lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the volatile Dagestan region of Russia - carried out the bombings to retaliate against the U.S. for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The brothers came to the U.S. with their parents and two sisters about a decade before the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following a shootout with police several days after the bombings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 21, faces 30 federal charges in the bombings and in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Seventeen of the charges carry the possibility of the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Some bombing survivors have said they plan to attend the trial; others say they have no desire to be there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It's not something I feel I need to do," said Jarrod Clowery, who suffered burns and shrapnel wounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"I have closure in my life. I'm happy. I have a second chance at life, and I'm living it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Clowery was watching the marathon with his friends, Paul and J.P. Norden, when the bombs exploded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Nordens each lost a leg.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Norden brothers also plan to stay away from the trial, but their mother, Liz, plans to be there every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The trial is expected to last three to four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It's important to me. I take it personally, what happened to my family," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In addition to the video, prosecutors also plan to show jurors what they call a confession Tsarnaev scrawled inside the boat he was hiding in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that. ... I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all," the note allegedly says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Tsarnaev's lawyers have made it clear that they plan to depict Tamerlan Tsarnaev as the mastermind of the attack and a powerful force in his brother's life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Legal analysts say portraying Tamerlan as a coercive influence will likely not be enough to win Dzhokhar an acquittal but could be a significant piece of the defense argument against the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>After the guilt phase of the trial, the same jury will decide whether he should be sentenced to life in prison without parole or the death penalty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The jury was chosen Tuesday after nearly two months of jury selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The all-white panel consists of 10 women and eight men, including a self-employed house painter, an air traffic controller, a former emergency room nurse and an executive assistant at a law firm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Tsarnaev may also get some help from his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>One of his sisters, Ailina Tsarnaeva, plans to attend at least part of the trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Liz Norden said she can't quite put her finger on why she feels such a strong need to be there.</td></tr>
