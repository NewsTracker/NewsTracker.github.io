<h3>Greece and Europe agree to a compromise, avoiding financial catastrophe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Brussels: Ending an acrimonious standoff, European leaders have hashed out a deal to extend Greece's bailout by four months, giving the troubled country a financial lifeline and avoiding a default with potentially destabilising consequences for the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The agreement, reached at an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels, paves the way for Greece to unlock further aid from its bailout, worth 240 billion ($350 billion).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the creditors will dole out the funds only if Greece meets certain conditions, setting the stage for tense negotiations that could unsettle the markets and create more political friction with Germany and other European countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>If Athens moves slowly, it might not get the money for months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Or the deal could fall apart altogether, again raising the prospect of a messy Greek departure from the euro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"As long as the program isn't successfully completed, there will be no payout," German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said after the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>As part of the deal, Greece will have to introduce a series of reforms required by creditors, like making labour laws more flexible and rooting out corruption.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>While Greece will have some potential leeway, the government must show that it is not abandoning austerity measures unilaterally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece, though, may still baulk at the demands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The new left-leaning government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, swept to power last month on pledges to rebuff European-imposed austerity in Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He also promised to get a better deal from the country's creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The deal also does not address the fundamental problems with Greece's economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Over the last five years, the economy has shrunk by a quarter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Unemployment stands at more than 25 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"It's a short-term agreement to tide Greece over, but it doesn't even do that in the sense that Germany has said they won't release money until the Greeks legislate reforms," said Mujtaba Rahman, chief Europe analyst at the Eurasia Group in London.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"It's not nearly enough to get Greece past the worst."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>As a result, discussions may begin "very soon" on a possible, third bailout for Greece, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Deciding what comes next was necessary because the program that was agreed to on Friday will expire in just four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>That is right before Greece must make two crucial bond payments worth 6.7 billion to the European Central Bank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While Mr Tsipras will be able to propose rollbacks on austerity measures, the deal represents a steep climb down from his election pledges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He and his outspoken Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, have insisted that the painful spending cuts required by Greece's creditors to mend the nation's tattered finances, including minimum wage and pension cuts, must be removed to help reboot the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Tsipras had vowed to get rid of the current bailout program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But Greece's creditors have insisted that Athens could not simply abandon previous accords to obtain crucial financing that the struggling country still needs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Despite Greece's resolve in recent weeks, the country's three main creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - will still largely continue to dictate the terms of the bailout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Both sides hailed the deal as a victory of sorts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The Greeks are claiming that the agreement is symbolic of their new approach toward Europe, in which they are able to bargain for easier fiscal terms from Brussels and still access crucial funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Mr Varoufakis portrayed the accord as "a way out for our country" and a "mutually beneficial arrangement" for Greece and its creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We averted the view that a country that is heavily indebted and in a program cannot possibly claim that elections can change something," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>European officials cast the pact as supportive of their view that money can be dispensed only if economic conditions are met.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The Greeks certainly will have a difficult time to explain the deal to their voters," Mr Schaeuble said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Some analysts, though, cautioned that the agreement only postpones difficult issues for another time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"When is a deal not really a deal? When it kicks the can down the road and when no one can agree on what was agreed," said Peter Doyle, a former economist at the IMF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>On Monday, Greece must send its creditors a list of all the policy measures it plans to take over the next four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>If the measures are acceptable, European finance ministers on Tuesday could sign off on an extension of the bailout agreement.</td></tr>
