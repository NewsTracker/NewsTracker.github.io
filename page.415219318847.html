<h3>At least two protesters arrested in Ferguson hours after U.S. report</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At least two protesters were arrested outside police headquarters in Ferguson, Missouri on Wednesday, according to police and online video, just hours after the release of a U.S. probe that found racial bias in the department.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The footage, shared by protesters, a local lawmaker and reporters on Twitter late on Wednesday, showed police take into custody at least two of the few dozen demonstrators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>When contacted, Ferguson police were not able to provide exact arrest totals or specify the charges, but a dispatcher said protesters had been asked to move out of the street "many, many times."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The arrests come just hours after U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder unveiled a report that found systemic racial bias created a "toxic environment" in the St. Louis suburb, but cleared white officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of unarmed black 18-year-old Michael Brown there last August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Brown's killing touched off a national debate on race, led to months of street protests and amplified long-standing complaints in Ferguson and across the country of police harassment and mistreatment of minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said three police department employees were responsible for offensive emails detailed in the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>All were put on administrative leave pending a probe and one has since been fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>None of the employees was identified.</td></tr>
