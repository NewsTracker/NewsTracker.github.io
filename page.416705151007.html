<h3>FIFA's Prince Ali seeks more say for national associations</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali of Jordan says national associations need to have more say in the governance of world football because "you cannot run everything from Zurich."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Prince Ali also told a regional SoccerEx conference Sunday that it was "a bit shocking" that he and two other challengers to incumbent Sepp Blatter have not been able to speak at recent FIFA events.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blatter's two other challengers are Dutch FA head Michael van Praag and former Portugal international Luis Figo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Asked in an onstage interview if two challengers might pull out before the May 29 election, presumably to improve the chances of anyone unseating Blatter, he said: "I think we will be communicating with each other, but right now we are all focused on what we want to do."</td></tr>
