<h3>Greece will request loan extension</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 3.3bn increase in the so-called Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) is critical for Greece's banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Depositors have been taking savings out of the country, depleting the banks' access to cash to lend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>However, the Greek central bank is said to have requested an additional 10bn of emergency funding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The ECB had already raised the amount available to Greek banks by 5bn to about 65bn last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The deal will give Athens breathing space to negotiate a loan deal with its European creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Greece is asking the eurozone for a six-month extension of its European loan, a Greek government official said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It would not be a renewal of the current bailout agreement, which includes strict austerity measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>On Monday night, Greece rejected a plan to extend its 240bn ( 178bn) bailout, describing it as "absurd".</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Greece is likely to run out of money if a deal is not reached before the end of February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We should extend the credit programme by a few months to have enough stability so that we can negotiate a new agreement between Greece and Europe," Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told Germany's ZDF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis confirmed that meant Mr Varoufakis would be asking for a six-month extension to Greece's current loan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mr Sakellaridis told Greece's Antenna TV: "Let's wait today for the request for an extension of the loan contract to be submitted by finance minister Varoufakis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"All along deliberations are going on to find common ground, we want to believe that we are on a good path. We are coming to the table to find a solution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But he added the Greek government would not back down on issues that it considered non-negotiable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble dismissed the Greek proposal, telling broadcaster ZDF on Tuesday evening: "It's not about extending a credit programme but about whether this bailout programme will be fulfilled, yes or no."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mr Schaeuble added: "I don't have any new information, but there is no loan agreement, it's an assistance programme. And in this seemingly unimportant detail lies the key: Greece would like to receive credit, but not fulfil the conditions to allow Greece to recover economically."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In a surprise move, Greek MPs voted to elect pro-European conservative Prokopis Pavlopoulos as the country's new president on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The former minister and public law academic was put forward for the post in a bid to win much-needed cross-party support as Greece seeks to strike a deal with its international creditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Pavlopoulos was backed by the left-wing government as well as the main opposition party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Conservative European Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos had been considered the front-runner for the largely ceremonial post.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>An impasse over the selection of a new president triggered an early election last month that swept Syriza into government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Greek stock exchange rose 3% on Wednesday in morning trading in Athens as news of the loan extension application emerged, but later closed up just 1.1%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The eurozone has given Greece until Friday to decide if it wants to continue with the current bailout deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Greece wants to replace the bailout with a new loan that it says would give it time to find a permanent solution to the debt crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>On Tuesday, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a vote in the Greek parliament on whether to scrap the austerity programme on Friday, the same day as the eurozone deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"We will not succumb to psychological blackmail," Mr Tsipras told parliament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"We are not in a hurry and we will not compromise."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>US investment bank JP Morgan claimed over the weekend that 2bn worth of deposits was flowing out of Greek banks each week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>It estimated that if that were to remain the case, they would run out of cash to use as collateral against new loans within 14 weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>JP Morgan's estimate is based on a calculation that a maximum of 108bn of deposits is left in Greek banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The most up-to-date figures from the Greek central bank show deposits dropped 2.4% month-on-month in December to 160.3bn from 164.3bn, marking the third consecutive monthly fall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is also chairing the Eurogroup meetings of eurozone finance ministers, warned on Monday night there were just days left for talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Mr Dijsselbloem said it was now "up to Greece" to decide if it wanted more funding or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Greek government wants to scrap the current bailout deal, because of the very painful programme of spending cuts and other austerity measures that come with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Instead, it wants a bridging loan to help it meet its short term needs, while a new deal is hammered out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Having been elected on an anti-austerity ticket, it can't afford to back down, or it will be accused of betraying Greek voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>But other members of the eurozone, and Germany in particular, have a very different agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>They want Greece to accept an extension to the current deal - with the rather uncertain promise of "flexibility" if it plays ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>They don't want to show any signs of weakness, because of the signal that could send to anti-austerity movements in countries such as Spain, Portugal or Cyprus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>It would also be politically toxic in Germany, where many voters dislike the idea that they are paying for Greece's mistakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>That doesn't mean a compromise is impossible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>It simply means any deal would have to be presented as both an end to the current austerity programme and a continuation of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>A political fudge, in other words - and Brussels has plenty of experience in putting those together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>So a short-term solution is possible, but far from certain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Greece has proposed a new bailout programme that involves a bridging loan to keep the country going for six months and help it repay 7bn ( 5.2bn) of maturing bonds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>The second part of the plan would see the county's debt refinanced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Part of this might be through "GDP bonds" - bonds carrying an interest rate linked to economic growth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Greece also wants to see a reduction in the primary surplus target - the surplus the government must generate (excluding interest payments on debt) - from 3% to 1.49% of GDP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>In Greece last week, two opinion polls indicated that 79% of Greeks supported the government's policies, and 74% believed its negotiating strategy would succeed.</td></tr>
