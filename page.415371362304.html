<h3>Boris Nemtsov: Claim Suspect Was Tortured</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Andrei Babushkin said Zaur Dadayev claimed he spent two days manacled with a sack over his head after being arrested over the killing of Mr Nemtsov, who was shot dead in Moscow last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The former deputy prime minister and long-time critic of President Vladimir Putin was shot four times in the back as he walked with his girlfriend along a bridge in the heart of the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Babushkin told AFP news agency: "There are reasons that lead us to believe Zaur Dadayev confessed under torture."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He added that he had seen "numerous wounds" on the body of the former Chechen police officer during a visit to his cell on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mr Babushkin reported Dadayev as saying: "They shouted at me all the time, 'You killed Nemtsov, didn't you?'. I said, no."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Dadayev said he admitted to the killing to secure the release of an ex-colleague, Ruslan Yusupov, who was present when he was detained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Babushkin said Mr Yusupov has since disappeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Dadayev has been charged along with his cousin Anzor Gubashev of shooting Mr Nemtsov, 55.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Court officials said the three men - Gubashev's younger brother Shagid Gubashev and two others named only as Bakhayev and Eskerkhanov - have not been charged, and their case will be handled by a separate judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Mr Babushkin also said there were "reasonable" grounds to suggest the Gubashev brothers have been tortured during detention as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said Anzor Gubashev had abrasions around his nose, wrists and legs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Dadayev was a deputy commander for a battalion attached to the Chechen interior ministry, while Gubashev worked for a private security company in Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The court heard the men were being investigated under a section of the Russian criminal code relating to murders committed for financial gain, a sign investigators believe the killing was a hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Allies of Mr Nemtsov believe his assassination was ordered by the Russian government to silence dissenters, an allegation that has been strenuously denied by the Kremlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The killing sent shockwaves through the country's opposition and sparked international condemnation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Investigators have suggested the killers wanted to destabilise Russia, which is facing its worst stand-off with the West since the Cold War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>They are investigating several motives, including possible connections to Islamic extremism and Mr Nemtsov's personal life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Investigators say they are looking into the possibility Mr Nemtsov was targeted for his support for the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, which published images of the Prophet Mohammed and was subsequently attacked by gunmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>There was a massive rally against the publication in Chechnya, and the theory appeared to gain ground after Dadayev's confession.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But a co-leader of Mr Nemtsov's opposition party has said claims he was killed by Chechen Islamists are "absurd" and designed to deflect suspicion from Mr Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ilya Yashin dismissed theories his friend was murdered because of his condemnation of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, and believes his killing was ordered by the Kremlin.</td></tr>
