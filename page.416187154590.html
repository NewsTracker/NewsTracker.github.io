<h3>Egypt imposes life jail penalty for cross-border tunnel use</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Egypt declared a state of emergency in the border area last year after at least 33 security personnel were killed in attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, a remote but strategic region bordering Israel, Gaza and the Suez Canal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>There were several militant attacks in the Sinai on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The amendments to the penal code were passed by presidential decree, MENA said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It also said people who used illegal crossings to transfer goods or equipment could also face a life sentence, as well as people with knowledge of them who failed to report them to the authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It said the government had the right seize buildings on top of the tunnels or any of the tools used to make them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Residents of Sinai, who complain they have long been neglected by the state, say they rely on smuggling trade through tunnels for their living.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Egyptian authorities see the tunnels as a threat and regularly destroy them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In November Egypt said it would deepen its buffer zone with Gaza after finding local tunnels, a move which stoked local resentment.</td></tr>
