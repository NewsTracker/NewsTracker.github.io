<h3>Mets hold off furious Miami rally in 9th, win 6th straight (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MIAMI (AP) -- The New York Mets made their latest win look easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Until the ninth inning, that is.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>''We have to make them swing the bat,'' Collins said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''You can't walk anybody with that type of lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Juan Uribe hit a three-run homer and Lucas Duda drove in three runs, giving Matt Harvey (10-7) a huge lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Harvey pitched seven dominant innings, giving up two hits and striking out six without a walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>''Run support helps,'' Harvey said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mets relievers Eric O'Flaherty, acquired Tuesday from Oakland, Hansel Robles and Familia all struggled in the ninth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Familia gave up two hits, but got Yelich for his 29th save in 34 chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Yelich made two outs in the last inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>David Phelps (4-8) went 4 1-3 innings as Miami lost its third in a row.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>Justin Bour hit an RBI double and scored on Ichiro Suzuki's single off O'Flaherty.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>Dee Gordon greeted Familia with an RBI single and Derek Dietrich, who led off the inning with a single, followed with an infield hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Yelich then grounded out to Duda at first base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''To be down 8-0, it would have been easy to cash it in right there and just finish the game and get it over,'' Marlins manager Dan Jennings said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Miami has lost 10 of 12 and Phelps has dropped five straight decisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''It's frustrating.</td></tr>
