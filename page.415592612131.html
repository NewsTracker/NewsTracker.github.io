<h3>Kansas Senate panel approves proposed $15.5B state budget</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Senate Ways and Means Committee's 9-2 vote on the spending blueprint for the fiscal year beginning July 1 sends it to the full chamber for debate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The House is considering its own budget, which also would require higher taxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Senate Commerce Committee also approved a bill that would limit bargaining between state agencies and public employee unions and prevent direct deductions from teachers' and government workers paychecks for union dues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A House committee endorsed a bill that would establish a process for the state to draft a plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And the Senate approved bills designed to help prospective college students and protect religious groups on campuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Here is a look at Thursday's major legislative developments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Republican-dominated Legislature and GOP Gov. Sam Brownback must close a projected budget deficit of nearly $600 million for the next fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The shortfall arose after lawmakers aggressively cut personal income taxes in 2012 and 2013 at Brownback's urging to stimulate the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The spending plan approved by the Senate Ways and Means Committee would require more than $200 million in annual tax increases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"We don't have the money to pay for it," said Sen. Laura Kelly of Topeka, the committee's ranking Democrat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both chambers expect to debate their proposed budgets next week and to consider revenue-raising proposals in early May, at the end of lawmakers' annual session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Committee Chairman Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, said lawmakers have trimmed in many areas, including transportation and general government spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Total spending would decline slightly in the next fiscal year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Senate approved, 27-11, a bill requiring universities to tell prospective students how much money they are likely to earn based on the degrees they receive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The measure would require universities to collect data on the economic outcomes of their graduates and make it available to prospective students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Kansas Board of Regents has estimated the research will cost as much as $5.5 million the first year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Senators also passed, 30-8, a measure saying state universities, community colleges and technical colleges can't refuse to recognize or deny campus facilities to groups that limit membership based on their religious beliefs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Supporters called it a religious freedom bill, but critics said colleges could be forced to sanction discrimination on their campuses by recognizing groups that exclude gays and lesbians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee would limit collective bargaining between state agencies and their workers to minimum wages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"The theme is to try to align government to look a little more like the private sector," said Sen. Jeff Melcher, a Leawood Republican.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The measure would prevent state and local agencies and school districts from using their resources to collect dues for unions through paycheck deductions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The bill initially would have barred only deductions for union dues, but members broadened it so that state agencies and school districts also couldn't make many other deductions - including contributions to charities such as the United Way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Committee members said it's fairer not to single out union dues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Critics say such Republican-backed measures in Kansas and elsewhere are meant to undermine the political power of unions, which tend to support Democrats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>They also argue the changes are designed to lessen job protections for government workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>But lawmakers also are likely to face a strong backlash from community charities relying on paycheck deductions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"This would really, really hurt United Ways," said Lee Ann Smith Desper, executive director of the Konza United Way in Manhattan, who said her group receives about $88,000 a year from Kansas State University employees' paycheck deductions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The House Energy and Environment Committee approved a bill that is a response to a federal rule directing states to develop stricter greenhouse gas emission standards by June 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Under the bill, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment would have the authority to develop a plan but the Legislature's energy committees would have to sign off on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>The House Education Committee tabled a bill that would end a tuition break at state colleges for some young immigrants living in the state illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The 10-8 vote exposed a split among majority Republicans on immigration issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>A 2004 law allows high school graduates who came to the U.S. illegally to pay the lower tuition rates at state universities, community colleges and technical colleges normally reserved for legal residents.</td></tr>
