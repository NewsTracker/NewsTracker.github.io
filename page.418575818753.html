<tr><td>2</td><td>Google's second quarter: What to watch Analysts expect Google to earn $6.70 a share, excluding certain expenses, according to Thomson Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO -Google will report second-quarter financial results after the close of trading Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Google is forecast to earn $6.70 a share, excluding certain expenses, according to analyst consensus from Thomson Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A year ago, Google earned $6.08 a share.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney says he expects Google to generate revenue of $14.27 billion, excluding traffic acquisition costs, which is the revenue Google splits with partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>That's up 13% from $12.67 billion a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Google will hold an earnings call with analysts on Thursday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This is the first earnings call in which Ruth Porat, who joined as chief financial officer from Morgan Stanley in May, will speak with investors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We believe she has incentive to make sure that she meets or exceeds Street expectations in her first quarter out to start off on the right foot with investors," said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Wall Street is hoping for more details from Porat on the performance of Google businesses such as YouTube and mobile search advertising.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's also hoping Google might share some of its $60 billion cash stockpile through a buyback or a dividend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Munster says the latter is unlikely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"Some investors are hoping that Porat's arrival may also mean a more open approach to capital return. Overall, we believe that CEO Larry Page (much like Steve Jobs at Apple) has been the bottleneck to capital return instead of the CFO seat," Munster wrote in a research report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We believe that Page views Google's large cash position as an area of strength and is not afraid to use to make large bets (Motorola patents, DoubleClick, Nest, YouTube, Waze, etc.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>We believe this view is likely furthered by Facebook's recent major acquisitions in WhatsApp, Instagram, and Oculus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the spotlight: revenue growth as Google's lucrative search advertising business slows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Revenue rose 12% in the first quarter, down from a 19% increase a year earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Wall Street is worried that search ads are eroding on mobile devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Analysts will also be watching expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Wall Street Journal reported that Porat is trying to keep a lid on costs after operating expenses grew faster than revenue last year.</td></tr>
