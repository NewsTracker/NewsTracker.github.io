<h3>Libyan official: Islamic State militants attack oil field</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The militants swept down from the city of Sirte to attack the al-Dhahra oil field, trading fire with guards and blowing up residential and administrative buildings before retreating, said Mashallah al-Zewi, the oil minister in the Tripoli-based government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"They surrounded the site from three different directions, and when guards ran out of ammunition, they stormed the place, looted everything and then bombed the buildings, leaving them in ruins," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>All employees and workers, including foreigners, were safely evacuated, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Al-Zewi said that the field is run by al-Waha oil company and other American companies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Al-Waha said on its website that al-Dhahra is one of Libya's oldest fields, with production starting in 1962.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Libya's state-run National Oil Corporation runs the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Officials believe the same militants were behind the February attack on Libya's al-Mabrouk oil field that killed 10 guards and saw seven foreigners abducted, including three Filipinos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>French oil giant Total SA says it worked at that field until 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Oil production dropped dramatically in Libya after the country's 2011 civil war that toppled dictator Moammar Gadhafi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Al-Zewi said Libya's daily production is now nearing 500,000 barrels a day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Libya's internationally recognized government has been confined to the far east since Islamist-allied militias seized Tripoli last year and revived an earlier government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That's worsened militia violence and allowed militants allied with the Islamic State group to gain control of Sirte and Libya's eastern city of Darna.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>These Islamic State-affiliated militants carried out a deadly attack on a luxury hotel in Tripoli in January, and in February released a video showing them behead 21 Egyptian Christians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Egyptian military launched airstrikes on Darna in retaliation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The government in Tripoli is led by Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It has denied the existence of the Islamic State affiliate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The clashes at al-Dhahra are among the first known instances of Libya's Islamist-allied militias battling the Islamic State affiliate.</td></tr>

<h3>Russia stages show of strength at the tank Olympics... but Ukraine decided not to enter</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Fortunately this was not a new, disturbing escalation to the Ukraine conflict, but a spot of war gaming dubbed the Tank Olympics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The competition see teams in armoured vehicles taking part in a racing and shooting contest, much like a standard Olympic biathlon event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>These images show crews competing at a regional stage of the tournament at the Anastasyevsky training ground in Khabarovsk, Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Last year, the inaugural competition saw 12 countries participating, including Angola, Armenia, Belarus, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Russia, Serbia and Venezuela.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>According to the rules, the tanks must negotiate a 20km course while facing various obstacles, including a slalom section, river shallows, a steep hill, a pontoon bridge and an escarpment and shoot a set of targets along the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The tanks also face obstacles in the way of Russian aircraft and infantry combat vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>According to organisers, NATO countries including United States, Italy and Germany and Ukraine were asked to compete in the championships last year, but declined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Russia went on to win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>This year's tournament comes amid heightened tensions surrounding the conflict in Ukraine, with Russia being accused of supplying equipment and troops to help separatists rebels fighting Kiev troops in the east of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>A military source today said a Ukrainian government serviceman was killed and another wounded in eastern Ukraine despite a ceasefire deal with pro-Russian rebels who have taken up arms there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Both Ukrainians and rebels accuse each other of violating a ceasefire agreement that went into effect on February 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has called the deal the last chance for peace between Kiev and pro-Russian rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Vladislav Seleznyov, a military spokesman, said pro-Russian rebels had fired on Ukrainian positions 47 times in the last day, mostly near the rebel stronghold of Donetsk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The conflict has plunged ties between Russia and the West to Cold War era-lows and continuing violence has slowed down other aspects of the peace deal agreed last month in Minsk, including the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Washington and Brussels accuse Moscow of arming the separatists and reinforcing their ranks with Russian troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Russia has repeatedly denied involvement and blames the United States for pushing the pro-Western government in Kiev to war.</td></tr>
