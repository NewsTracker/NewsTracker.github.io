<h3>Cannes Watch: Don't ask the Coens about TV</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CANNES, France (AP) - Don't ask the Coen brothers about TV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They're not watching.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Joel and Ethan Coen are presidents of the jury that will decide the Cannes Film Festival top honor, the Palme d'Or.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Introducing their jury, which includes Jake Gyllenhaal and Guillermo del Toro, the filmmaking brothers confessed Wednesday they remain outsiders to the much-celebrated rise of TV dramas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It's not that I don't like TV," said Ethan Coen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"It's alien to me. I haven't watched a television show in decades."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Joel suggested he was no less familiar, despite his wife, Frances McDormand, recently starring in the acclaimed HBO miniseries "Olive Kitteridge."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>''You're going to get me in trouble," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The Coens' 1996 film "Fargo" was turned into the FX series, but with little input from them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On the increase of new digital avenues like Netflix for movie watching, Joel wasn't much more enthusiastic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"How do we feel about people watching 'Lawrence of Arabia' on their iPhone?" he said, archly rephrasing a more general question about digital media.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"There's something special about sitting with a big crowd of people watching a movie on a big 80-foot screen."</td></tr>
