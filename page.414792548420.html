<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BERLIN (AP) - Germany's finance minister says he's very skeptical that officials from the 19 countries that use the euro will reach a deal on Greece's debt when they meet on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The new Greek government is seeking short-term "bridge financing" until a new solution to Greece's crushing debt load is found.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Asked if he expects a solution at Monday's meeting of eurozone finance ministers, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that what he's heard of technical-level talks over the weekend makes him "very skeptical."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Schaeuble told Deutschlandfunk radio that "Greece must see that you can't keep living above your means and then keep making proposals for how others should pay even more."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Schaeuble said: "I feel sorry for the Greeks. They've elected a government that's behaving pretty irresponsibly at the moment."</td></tr>
