<h3>New Mexico working to modernize voting system</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>New Mexico is embarking on the final phase of an effort to modernize the state's election management and voter registration system, but officials say some changes won't be fully implemented until after the 2016 general election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The agency already has updated the candidate filing system and streamlined the reporting of election results, but work has yet to start on revamping voter registration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The agency's technology chief, Kari Fresquez, says one of the goals is to make it easier for voters to access and update their information online, look up election dates, find polling places and read sample ballots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Legislature has approved $1.4 million for the agency to finish the project.</td></tr>
