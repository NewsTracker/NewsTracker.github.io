<h3>Iraq's prime minister says troops have reached center of Tikrit in battle with Islamic State</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In a statement on Twitter, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced the "liberation of Tikrit" and congratulated Iraqi security forces on their "historic milestone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But an official statement from his office said the troops "hoisted the Iraqi flag" over the Salahuddin provincial headquarters in Tikrit and are moving to control the entire city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, the commander of the Salahuddin operation, said his forces fighting from the west were still 300 meters (325 yards) from the center of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Extremists from the Islamic State group seized Saddam Hussein's hometown last summer during its lightning advance across northern and western Iraq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The battle for Tikrit is seen as a key step toward eventually driving the militants out of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city that is farther north.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Street-by-street fighting raged into the afternoon, and estimates differed widely on how much of this strategic city on the banks of the Tigris River that Iraqi forces held.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Army Lt. Gen. Talib Shaghati said at least 75 percent of Tikrit had been recaptured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ammar Hikmat, deputy governor of Salahuddin province, said more than 40 percent was under Iraqi control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Our security forces are now pushing forward toward the presidential complex and have already entered parts of it," Hikmat said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I think the whole city will be retaken within the coming 24 hours."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An Associated Press reporter embedded with Iraqi security forces saw soldiers surround the iconic presidential palace, and they also surrounded the provincial government headquarters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Soldiers worked to detonate bombs remotely, while federal police went house to house looking to arrest militants or identify booby traps that may slow the offensive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Interior Ministry spokesman Brig.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Gen. Saad Maan Ibrahim said at least 40 militants were killed Tuesday, and Iraqi forces dismantled 300 roadside bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said the federal police, backed by allied militias, were able to clear the government compound, the Tikrit provincial council headquarters, its security headquarters and the presidential palace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The leader of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Units, a collaborative force made up mostly of Shiite militias, also said his fighters had rejoined the Tikrit operation, less than a week after announcing a boycott over U.S. involvement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Abu Mahdi al-Mohandis told the AP that his fighters participated in the southern offensive and would be joining the offensive on the northern and western fronts shortly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Iranian military advisers have been providing significant support since the offensive began March 2, arming and training the Iraqi Shiite militias, which have played a prominent role on the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Militiamen make up more than two-thirds of the force fighting in Tikrit against the Islamic State group, also known as ISIL or ISIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But the operation stalled until U.S. forces joined the offensive by launching airstrikes March 25.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Since then, Iraqi allied forces have moved in on the city, although they have been slowed by snipers and hidden bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve said coalition forces conducted seven airstrikes in Iraq since Monday morning, including one in Tikrit which hit multiple IS buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Iraqi military has struggled to recover from its collapse against the Islamic State group in June, when commanders disappeared in the face of the extremists' advance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Pleas for more ammunition went unanswered, and in some cases, soldiers stripped off their uniforms and ran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Recapturing Tikrit would be the biggest win so far for Baghdad's Shiite-led government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The city is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Baghdad and lies on the road connecting the capital to Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Retaking it will help Iraqi forces have a major supply link for any future operation against Mosul.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>U.S. military officials have said a coordinated mission to retake Mosul likely will begin in April or May and involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>But the Americans have cautioned that if the Iraqis are not ready, the offensive could be delayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"The focus remains to drive ISIL out of Iraq," said Col.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"We have struck at ISIL's command and control, supply lines, fighters and leaders, and military and economic infrastructure and resources," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"We have debilitated ISIL's oil producing, processing and transportation infrastructure. ... It will take time, but we will succeed in our mission."</td></tr>
