<h3>Govt pursues Palmer team for uni votes</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A second version of the government's legislation is likely to be debated in the Senate mid-March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>However, it may face more changes as the government pursues the six crossbench votes it needs to have its legislation clear the upper house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>While Education Minister Christopher Pyne is tight-lipped about negotiations, the prime minister revealed the government hoped to win over PUP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Plainly Senator Dio Wang is very keen on our proposals," he said on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Hopefully as the Palmer Party discusses this more and more, Senator Wang will be more and more influential."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Earlier, he said both PUP senators wanted deregulation but party leader Clive Palmer was holding them back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mr Palmer threw cold water on the prospect of changing its position, stating again that PUP was agreed to oppose deregulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Meanwhile, Mr Pyne has confirmed he and crossbenchers are discussing a proposal from HECS architect Bruce Chapman to reduce government subsidies to universities who raise their fees above a set level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Professor Chapman says tapering subsidies creates a disincentive to hike fees too high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He and colleague David Phillips worked with education department staff to develop the proposal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>If adopted, the plan could allay concerns about skyrocketing fees under the government's plan to deregulate the university sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Labor has derided it as a "great big new tax".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This is a plan that would actually see fees skyrocket," said opposition higher education spokesman Kim Carr.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The Greens labelled it a fine for universities that overcharged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But the government insists the measure isn't a fine and rejects suggestions it's a tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"In no way is the government considering taxes on universities," Assistant Education Minister Simon Birmingham told the Senate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Senator Carr's "fantasy" was a gross misrepresentation of Prof Chapman's proposal, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Even if the Chapman proposal was adopted, every university student would still attract some level of government subsidy and would be able to take out HECS loans to cover fees.</td></tr>

<h3>Different views of Boston Marathon bombing suspect to be described during death penalty trial</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It's whether he deserves to die for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a blunt opening statement at the nation's biggest terrorism trial in nearly 20 years, Tsarnaev's own lawyer flatly told a jury that the 21-year-old former college student committed the crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"It WAS him," said defense attorney Judy Clarke, one of the nation's foremost death-penalty specialists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But in a strategy aimed at saving Tsarnaev from a death sentence, she argued that he had fallen under the malevolent influence of his now-dead older brother, Tamerlan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"The evidence will not establish and we will not argue that Tamerlan put a gun to Dzhokhar's head or that he forced him to join in the plan," Clarke said, "but you will hear evidence about the kind of influence that this older brother had."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Three people were killed and more than 260 hurt when two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line on April 15, 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Tsarnaev, then 19, was accused of carrying out the attacks with 26-year-old Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout and getaway attempt days later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Federal prosecutors used their opening statements, along with heartbreaking testimony and grisly video, to sketch a picture of torn-off limbs, ghastly screams, pools of blood, and the smell of sulfur and burned hair in the streets of Boston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They painted Tsarnaev as a cold-blooded killer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Tsarnaev planted a bomb designed to "tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle," then hung out with his college buddies as if he didn't have a care in the world, prosecutor William Weinreb said.</td></tr>
