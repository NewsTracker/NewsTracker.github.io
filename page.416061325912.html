<h3>Attack in Western Mexico Kills 15 Police Officers, 5 Wounded</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Monday ambush in a rural area of Jalisco left police vehicles riddled with bullet holes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It was the largest death toll in a single attack on law enforcement since 12 federal police officers were killed in neighboring state of Michoacan in 2010.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Jalisco state prosecutors' office said several officers had been hit in the shootout late Monday in a rural area as the police convoy traveled between the Pacific coast resort of Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara, the state capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Jalisco is home to a drug cartel known as "Jalisco New Generation," which experts say is now among Mexico's most powerful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Prosecutors would not confirm the gang was involved in the attack, but it was hard to imagine any rival gang launching such a large attack on Jalisco's home turf.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>While state Security Commissioner Alejandro Solorio did not say how the attack was carried out, he said the convoy was "ambushed" in a "cowardly attack."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Raul Benitez, a security expert at Mexico's National Autonomous University, "the serious thing about this attack was that it was very well planned and orchestrated, with a military-style strategy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Local media reported that a vehicle was hijacked, parked across the two-lane road and set on fire, to force the convoy to stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"This was planned, a lot of gunmen were involved, they blocked the highway to surround them (police) and attack with military superiority," said Benitez.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Benitez said it was the first time a cartel appeared to be mounting a direct, head-on challenge to authorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The Jalisco cartel has decided to start a military offensive against security forces, and that is rare," Benitez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>While gunmen from other cartels have been known to open fire on police and soldiers, it is usually because they are being pursued and want to escape capture, Benitez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Moreover, the ambush in the township of Soyatan, Jalisco is just the latest in a two-week-long series of attacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>On March 19, gunmen in Jalisco ambushed a federal police convoy, killing five officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>On March 30, gunmen ambushed and tried to kill Solorio, the state security commissioner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He escaped unharmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>And on Monday, gunmen killed the police chief of another Jalisco town, Zacoalco de Torres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Solorio said the most recent attacks are in retaliation for the March 23 shootout in which police killed gang boss Heriberto Acevedo Cardenas, who is nicknamed "El Gringo."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jalisco state prosecutor Luis Carlos Najera had previously identified Acevedo Cardenas as the mastermind behind a May 2014 ambush of Mexican army troops in another part of Jalisco state that killed four soldiers and injured two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Authorities said at the time that attack was carried out by the Jalisco New Generation cartel in reprisal for the army's seizure of stolen gasoline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Ambushes of state-level security officials and Mexican army patrols are relatively rare in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The Jalisco attacks suggest the conflict there is reaching a new level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The cartel has been violent since it was founded in 2010 following the death of Jalisco-based Sinaloa cartel leader Ignacio "Nacho" Coronel.</td></tr>
