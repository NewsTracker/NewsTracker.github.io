<h3>?La Tete Haute? to open 2015 Cannes Film Festival</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Catherine Deneuve's latest movie, "La Tete Haute", will open next month's Cannes Film Festival, the organizers said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The French film -- whose title translates as "holding one's head high" -- tells the story of a juvenile delinquent, a social worker trying to save him, and a children's court judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It was made by Emmanuelle Bercot, who previously directed French screen icon Deneuve in a 2013 road-trip movie titled "On My Way".</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The festival said in a statement it was the first time a female director has been given the prestigious opening night slot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Cannes in the past has often tapped big-budget US productions to kick off the festival and give it some Hollywood glamour, such as "Grace of Monaco" with Nicole Kidman last year, and "The Great Gatsby" with Leonardo DiCaprio the year before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Thierry Fremaut, the film festival's director, said this year's choice "may seem suprising" but reflected the event's aim of starting "with a different piece, which is both bold and moving".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Cannes Film Festival will run from May 13 to 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Chelsea Handler has no shame in baring it all for social media!</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The star witness in Suge Knight's murder case said Monday he won't "snitch" on the founder of Death Row Records.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Finally, the Tribeca Film Festival has defeated its own effort to be irrelevant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Mike Marts' days at Marvel Comics have come to an end as he creates his own path in the industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Springtime may finally be here, but winter is still coming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Especially with life-size White Walkers on the streets of Manhattan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Academy Award-winning movie Dallas Buyers Club is earning fame in Asia not for its cinematic wonder alone.</td></tr>
