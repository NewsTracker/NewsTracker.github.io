<h3>Nigeria says it has pushed Boko Haram out of all but 3 areas</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Nigeria says they've now pushed Boko Haram out of all but three local government districts in the northeast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Nigerian army said on Tuesday it had repelled Boko Haram from all but three local government districts in the northeast, claiming victory for its offensive against the Islamist insurgents less than two weeks before a presidential election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>At the start of this year, Boko Haram controlled around 20 local government areas, a territory the size of Belgium, in its bloody six-year-old campaign to carve out an Islamic state in religiously mixed Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But a concerted push by Nigeria's military and neighbours Chad, Cameroon and Niger has regained considerable ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At the weekend, Nigerian government forces recaptured the city of Bama, the second biggest in northeasterly Borno state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We have three local governments remaining, Abadam, Kalabaldi and Gwoza, and we are optimistic that with time we will liberate those," Lt.-Gen. Tobiah Minimah, the army chief of staff, told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>President Goodluck Jonathan, who is running for re-election, had been criticized for not doing enough to tackle the insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His challenger, Muhammadu Buhari, has been campaigning on his reputation for being tough on security matters when he was military ruler of Nigeria in the 1980s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is not clear how much impact the military advances will boost Jonathan's election chances in the tightly fought race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The militants were progressively chased out of Adamawa and Yobe states since the start of the year, and cornered into an ever shrinking area of Borno, the heartland of their insurgency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The elections were postponed in February until March 28, with the military citing Boko Haram as warranting the delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The electoral commission plans to set up polling booths in camps for the more than a million Nigerians displaced by the fighting, but there are fears that potentially millions of people may be unable to vote in areas affected by the violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Asked whether the vote could hold in the recaptured areas, Minimah said that would be up to the electoral commission.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"The areas have been liberated, but structures of governance ... will need to be reinstated so citizens can go back to their areas and (vote). How soon? I don't know."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Boko Haram's worsening atrocities against civilians hit international headlines in April last year, when the militants kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls from the village of Chibok, triggering a search for them that has been fruitless thus far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Minimah said there was no news on the whereabouts of the Chibok girls for now, but that the military was optimistic they would be able to get more information on it soon.</td></tr>

<h3>Fernando Alonso to prepare for Malaysian Grand Prix with simulator drive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The McLaren driver missed the opening race of the season in Australia to recover from concussion he suffered during a crash in pre-season testing in Barcelona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Alonso spent three days in hospital following the collision and, as part of his recovery, the two-times world champion will drive the McLaren simulator and will also undertake the official FIA medical tests he must pass before he is allowed to race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have a programme to help Fernando back to racing and he plans to be in a simulator," said a McLaren spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Formula One simulator reproduces kerbs and bumps and it is normal for drivers to prepare for a next race using one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Kevin Magnussen stood in for Alonso at the Australian Grand Prix last weekend but failed to take to the grid after smoke was pouring from the back of his car during the formation lap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although Alonso made a full recovery before the race in Melbourne and was described as "asymptomatic", his doctors believed it was best he sat out the race in Melbourne coming so soon after the accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Wary of the dangers of 'second-impact syndrome', and the prospect of sustaining another concussion so soon after the first, Alonso knew the decision taken to skip the race was the correct one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But he hopes to be back behind the wheel in time for the second grand prix of the season on March 29.</td></tr>
