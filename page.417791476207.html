<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SANAA, Yemen (AP) - An official with a Yemeni delegation including Shiite Houthi rebels headed to Geneva for U.N.-led peace talks says the group is stuck in Djibouti because Egyptian authorities will not allow it to land at Cairo airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief journalists, said Monday that the plane could not reach Geneva because of the ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The group, which also includes members of Yemeni political groups such as the socialists and the party of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a Houthi ally, left Sanaa on Sunday, for the talks.</td></tr>
