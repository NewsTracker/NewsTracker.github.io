<h3>NYC schools to get Muslim holidays</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Under the change announced by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and city Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina, there will be no class for Eid al-Adha, also known as the Festival of Sacrifice, starting next September 24.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Another Muslim holiday, Eid al-Fitr -- a festival marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan -- will become a holiday for those in summer school starting in 2016.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"This is a common-sense change," de Blasio said Wednesday, "and one that recognizes our growing Muslim community and honors its contributions to our city."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The decision affects some 1 million students in New York City.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>While it's not known exactly how many of them are Muslim, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said that almost 1 million of the more than 8 million people in the city's five boroughs practice Islam and a 2009 Columbia University study found that roughly 10% of New York City public school students are Muslim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The move isn't a surprise, given de Blasio's campaign pledge to alter the school calendar with Muslim families in mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Muslim students and their families who observe Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha shouldn't have to choose between an instructional day and their religious obligations," said Farina.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"This new addition will also enable a teachable moment in the classroom for our students to learn about religious tolerance and the societal contributions of various cultures."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York and the parent of three public school students, said a plan in which students wouldn't have to choose between education and faith "a win for our children and for future generations in this country."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Muslims are a part of the fabric of this country," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"We make our country proud, and today, New York City made us proud."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>New York City joins school districts in other states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts and Vermont, that similarly observe Muslim holidays, according to a news release from Farina's office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>And Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha join other religious holidays already on New York's public school calendar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>In addition to holidays like Easter that always fall on a weekend, students already have Christian holidays such as Good Friday and Christmas off, as well as the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Three of her other children disappeared in the chaos that ensued as the militants opened fire indiscriminately and threw people into the burning homes that had been set ablaze.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>As soon as Aboubakar was born, she and the children got into a boat.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Abakar and her children arrived this week at the camp after taking refuge in several other villages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The camp on the edge of the Sahara Desert is jointly run by the UN and the Chadian government.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>She hopes her husband will approve of the name she chose for him so he could get identity documents as a newborn refugee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>There was no naming ceremony, no father was present to buy a sheep to slaughter in sacrifice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>She named the child after his grandfather " for now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Many here hope their loved ones are not dead, but rather among those still hiding on the dozens of islands that dot Lake Chad which borders Chad, Nigeria and parts of Cameroon and Niger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Chadian military tries to protect those fleeing here but even so, several weeks ago, Boko Haram militants aboard motorized boats attacked the peninsula of N'gouboua inside Chad, killing at least eight civilians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Since then, families have been brought from there to the camp where UNICEF offers health service and school and activities for the children.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The families receive food from humanitarian agencies and are assigned tents erected in neat blocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They seek shade from the desert sun under acacia trees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Refugees take water from a well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Men riding camels through the region also come to the well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Chadian authorities believe more than 2,000 people remain trapped on islands, awaiting transport to a refugee camp in one of the world's poorest countries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Some 100,000 Nigerians have fled to in neighboring Niger, with roughly another 60,000 in Cameroon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mahamat Abakar, 60, last saw his wife and eight children two months ago as they divided themselves between two small wooden boats.</td></tr>
