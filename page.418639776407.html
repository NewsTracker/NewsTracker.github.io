<tr><td>2</td><td>NEW YORK - A former high-ranking official in the governing body of the world's most popular sport appeared before a judge Saturday, entering a not guilty plea in a massive racketeering and bribery case that rocked international soccer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jeffrey Webb will not be the last charged in the far-reaching corruption case to see the inside of a U.S. courtroom if prosecutors have their way - six more FIFA officials are charged and fighting extradition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Webb posted a $10 million bond at his arraignment in federal court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He surrendered three passports - two from the United Kingdom and one from the Cayman Islands - and will be required to wear an electronic monitoring device as a condition of his release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Webb's bond was secured by 10 different people including his wife and her parents, who were in the courtroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>They posted real estate, retirement accounts, automobiles and jewelry as part of the bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He did not speak except to say "Yes, your honor" when the judge asked if he understood the charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Afterward, Webb's lawyer, Edward O'Callaghan, did not comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Prosecutors also declined comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Webb, 50, was among seven FIFA officials detained in Switzerland last spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Prosecutors allege the defendants plotted to pay bribes of more than $150 million - tied to the award of broadcasting and hosting rights for the World Cup and other tournaments - over a 24-year period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Following the indictment, Webb received a provisional ban and was replaced as the FIFA vice president from the North and Central American and Caribbean region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Webb was also president of CONCACAF, the regional governing body for soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A total of 14 men - nine soccer officials and five marketing executives - were indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in May, including former FIFA vice president Jack Warner, who is resisting extradition from Trinidad and Tobago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The revelations prompted FIFA president Sepp Blatter to resign within days of the arrests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Webb promised reform when he was elected in 2012 to succeed Warner as president of CONCACAF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Other conditions of his release include having no contact with FIFA or CONCACAF officials, nor any of his alleged co-conspirators, prosecutors said during Saturday's court proceeding in Brooklyn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He was ordered to remain in the New York metropolitan area until his trial.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He agreed to pay the cost for a private security firm to conduct around-the-clock monitoring of his whereabouts.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>Webb, who is from the Cayman Islands, also has a residence in Georgia, prosecutors said during Saturday's proceeding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>After the court proceeding, Webb hugged his wife and other relatives who posted the bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>On Friday, sponsor Coca-Cola told FIFA to appoint an independent commission to lead a reform aimed at cleaning up the committee's governing body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The soft drinks giant said it asked FIFA to allow "one or more eminent, impartial leaders" to explore how the organization can regain credibility and trust from fans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Later in the day, McDonald's, another soccer sponsor, publicly rebuked FIFA for internal controls that they said were inconsistent with McDonald's standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>FIFA said it valued the sponsors' input but did not endorse calls for a commission.</td></tr>
