<h3>Katter questions fight for Bali Nine duo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The outspoken north Queenslander is still smarting over a decision by the Gillard government to suspend the live cattle trade to Indonesia over animal cruelty claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In parliament on Wednesday, he asked Foreign Minister Julie Bishop about government attempts to save convicted drug traffickers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan from execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mr Katter cited comments from former domestic spy chief David Irvine who called for Australia to do more to create a relationship with Jakarta that was meaningful to Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>You only had to look at the Indonesian parliament to see the level of dislike of Australia, Mr Irvine said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ms Bishop conceded the coalition had inherited a number of tensions in its relationship with Indonesia, nominating border protection, a spying scandal and the live cattle ban.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There will be challenges in the relationship as there are with any relationships, but Australia is determined to ensure that this is a strong relationship that endures," she said, insisting the government had made respectful representations for the lives of Sukumaran and Chan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some Liberal MPs reportedly are also concerned about the government's focus on the Bali Nine ringleaders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>West Australian MP Luke Simpkins raised the issue during a partyroom meeting on Tuesday, the ABC said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He suggested the government had "exhausted all avenues" and needed to shift its focus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Later in a statement, Mr Katter urged the government not to "play with fire" with Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The member for Kennedy said he and northern cattlemen had been pushing to repair relations with the country since the live cattle ban, including numerous meetings with the ambassador.</td></tr>

<h3>Google X exec: We need to fail faster</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>At Google X, failures come early and often, and that's how they like it, Teller said Tuesday during a keynote speech at SXSW.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Google X was designed to be a "moonshot factory."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>In other words, the research lab focuses not on incremental innovation, but rather on building risky, life-altering technologies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>According to Teller, the project's engineers run after the "hardest parts of the problem first -- as fast as we possibly can."</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Teller illustrated the failure fetish by describing the testing process for driverless cars -- one of the division's biggest projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>By 2012, the group had built a vehicle that had "basically mastered" highway driving, and select Google (GOOG) employees were trying out Lexus SUVs equipped with the technology.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We probably could have made a lot of money," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But they soon realized that human drivers weren't a reliable backup for the system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>They needed to build a car -- without a steering wheel or gas pedals -- that was fully autonomous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The engineers went back to the drawing board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Our success was in itself a failure," Teller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In the five years of Google X's existence, this failure was hardly the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But Teller said that every one of the "bumps and scrapes" have been worth it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Google Glass is another notable "failure."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>(Glass is now its own division, under the leadership of Nest founder Tony Fadell).</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"We allowed and sometimes even encouraged too much attention for the program," Teller said of the Google Glass Explorer Program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The world started to think of it as a finished product."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In reality, it was just an early prototype.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>They weren't trying to turn it into a product, but rather leverage the crowd for feedback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The intention was "to learn as fast as we can, to fail as fast as we can," said Teller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The group puts so much emphasis on learning from failure, he said, that success sometimes feels wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>In testing a new wind turbine prototype -- a technology that harnesses the power of the wind to create renewable energy without a weighty tower structure -- Teller said he was tasked by CEO Larry Page to crash the prototype at least five times.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Despite testing the vehicle in one of the "gustiest, windiest places in North America," it wouldn't crash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We felt like we failed somehow," Teller said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"There's magic in everyone believing that we might have failed because we failed to fail."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>A much larger version of the wind turbine, by the way, will start flying next month.</td></tr>
