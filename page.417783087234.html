<h3>Asian stocks bruised as Greek default fears rise</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Asian stocks kicked off a brand new trading week on the back foot, as trading sentiment took a hit from concerns over tortuous debt repayment talks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After talks aimed at reaching a deal between Greece and its creditors collapsed over the weekend, comments by Yanis Varoufakis, the embattled Greek finance minister, emerged early Monday, in which he claimed it would be possible to reach an agreement "in one night" but German chancellor Angela Merkel "must take part."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>According to Reuters, Varoufakis told German newspaper Bild that a 'Grexit' was not a sensible solution, adding that debt restructuring was "the only way possible for Greece" and that it would need no further aid if it was able to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We don't want any more money," Varoufakis said, adding that Germany and the rest of the Eurozone had already given Greece "far too much" money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ben Le Brun, market analyst at OptionsXpress, blamed the Greece talks for weighing down markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Greece is the word at the moment," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We need a solution or some finality so the market can get on with life, with or without Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Many investors have long expected Athens to capitulate to creditors in the end, but lack of tangible progress in negotiations in recent days is making them nervous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Some others think there is a real chance of a default but they are not sure whether that will lead to Greece's exit from the euro or whether Athens will find some way to stay within the currency bloc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"I would say the market has already priced in a default. But if Greece is going to leave the euro that is another matter," said Tetsuro Ii, president of Commons Asset Management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Regardless, Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Global Insight, told CNBC there would be turmoil in financial markets if Greece defaulted on its next debt repayment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I think there are increasing signs that this may not work out and so the risks have increased that if Greece doesn't come to a deal by end June, it may be forced to default on its International Monetary Fund (IMF) payment and if that happens, it could create a lot of turbulence in global financial markets and raises question marks about what happens next," Biswas said.</td></tr>
