<h3>Netanyahu: Deal must 'significantly' curb Iran nuke program</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a leading critic of the nuclear talks, which aim to curb Iran's suspect nuclear program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>After days of negotiations, U.S.-led world powers and Iran held a press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, announcing the outlines of the deal reached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Netanyahu has said he believes the deal, which must be finalized in the coming months, will leave too much of Iran's nuclear infrastructure intact.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Israel, like many other nations, believes Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Any deal must significantly roll back Iran's nuclear capabilities and stop its terrorism and aggression," Netanyahu said on Twitter, minutes before the announcement from Lausanne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Netanyahu has said he believes that the deal will leave Iran just months away from the point where it could make a nuclear bomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He has also pointed to Iran's support for Islamic militants across the region and its development of long-range missiles as cause for concern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Israel's Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, who oversees the monitoring of the nuclear program, said the deal was "disconnected from the sad reality" of the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Following Thursday's announcement, Iran and the world powers are expected to work out the details of a final deal by the end of June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Since the declaration is far from being a real agreement, we will continue in our efforts to explain and persuade the world in the hope of preventing a bad agreement, or at least to insert corrections and improvements," Steinitz said.</td></tr>
