<h3>Apple I computer sells for $200,000; donor sought</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, poses behind five Apple 1 computers in 2013 at History San Jose in Calif.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A California recycling firm is looking for a woman who, in early April, dropped off boxes of electronics that she had cleaned out from her house after her husband died.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>About two weeks later, the firm, Clean Bay Area, discovered inside one of the boxes a rare find: a vintage Apple I, one of only about 200 first-generation desktop computers put together by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ron Wayne in 1976.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The recycling firm sold the Apple I this month for $200,000 to a private collection, Vice President Victor Gichun said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>And now, because company policy is to split proceeds 50-50 with donors, he's looking for the mystery woman who refused to get a receipt or leave her name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We are looking for her to give her $100,000," Gichun said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"She said, 'I want to get rid of this stuff and clean up my garage,'" Gichun said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The company had a backlog of donations, and didn't immediately go through her boxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He feels badly because the woman said her husband had died a couple of months earlier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Gichun's own mother died at age 54, and he remembers how his father suffered afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Maybe, Gichun said, having some extra cash might help the woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Clean Bay Area recycles computers, lab equipment, test equipment and semiconductors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It deals mostly with businesses, but about five times a week individuals stop by with donations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The company doesn't pick up from individual donors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"I remember her," Gichun said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He said she was driving an SUV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>He's not divulging any other descriptive information about the woman or her car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the future, he said, he'll be more insistent about getting donors' contact information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>To get her $100,000 check, the mystery woman just needs to show up at the company's warehouse in Milpitas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"To prove who she is," Gichun said, "I just need to look at her."</td></tr>
