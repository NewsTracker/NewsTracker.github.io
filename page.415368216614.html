<h3>Chechnya?s leader vows loyalty to Putin amid Nemtsov probe</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ramzan Kadyrov thanked Putin for awarding him the Order of Honor, one of Russia's highest decorations, saying that it would be "the lightest task" for him to sacrifice his life for the Russian leader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We are infantrymen of the president of Russia!" he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Some observers say the arrest of five suspects accused of involvement in the Feb. 27 slaying of Putin's prominent critic, Boris Nemtsov, could strain Kremlin's relations with Kadyrov, who has run Chechnya like his own fiefdom while relying on federal subsidies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>One of the suspects, Zaur Dadaev, was a senior officer in Chechnya's police force.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A judge said during Saturday's hearing that he confessed to the crime, but Dadaev said in comments carried by the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets Tuesday that he was not guilty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The newspaper quoted him as telling rights activists who visited him in prison that he hadn't been given a chance to plead innocent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Following Dadaev's arrest, Kadyrov praised him as a brave soldier and a deeply religious man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Chechen leader also hailed another suspect, who blew himself up with a grenade when police came to arrest him at his apartment in Chechnya's regional capital, Grozny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kadyrov's comments reflected a degree of defiance following the arrests, a rare occasion when federal law-enforcement agencies dared to prosecute those loyal to the Chechen strongman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Oleg Orlov, the head of Memorial, a respected Russian human rights group, said the arrests and the subsequent award were a message to Kadyrov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"They show Kadyrov that he's not quite his own boss, and some members of his entourage will be punished," Orlov told The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"It's a signal: We will clean the field around you so that you know your place, but you are personally not in trouble yet."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Alexei Malashenko, a Caucasus expert with the Carnegie Endowment's Moscow office, said that by awarding Kadyrov with a medal Putin assured him of his personal trust despite strong anti-Kadyrov sentiments in the Russian law-enforcement agencies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"Some people in security services of the Russian Federation don't like Ramzan Kadyrov because it's permitted to him to do everything he wants," Malashenko said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>But Putin, Malashenko added, apparently "understands that at the moment it's necessary to use Islam as a political instrument for Ramzan Kadyrov."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"They are like Siamese twins: Kadyrov will certainly not survive without Putin, and it would be difficult for Putin to do without Kadyrov," Malashenko told the AP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Kadyrov has used generous Kremlin funding to rebuild Chechnya after two separatist wars and has relied on his feared security force of former rebels like himself to stabilize the North Caucasus province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>International human rights groups have accused Kadyrov of rampant abuses, including arbitrary arrest, torture and extrajudicial killings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The Kremlin has counted on Kadyrov to pacify Chechnya, turning a blind eye to his campaign to enforce Islamic rules, including mandatory headscarves for women.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In the wake of the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris, which published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, Kadyrov called those who defended the French satirical magazine his "personal enemies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He also staged a massive rally in Grozny to press the point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Russia's top investigative agency has said that Nemtsov's criticism of the Charlie Hebdo attackers could have been a motive behind his killing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Echoing the claim, Kadyrov said on his Instagram account Saturday that Dadaev was shocked by the magazine's cartoons and commentaries in their support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Malashenko said he didn't believe that Nemtsov was targeted for his comments related to Charlie Hebdo because he was far less outspoken than others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>His view was shared by many other observers, who have remained skeptical about the official version, saying that while Nemtsov criticized the Charlie Hebdo attackers, he made no comments against Islam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Many continued to insist that his killing just outside the Kremlin was likely rooted in his criticism of Putin.</td></tr>

<h3>Formula One driver Van der Garde's Sauber bid hangs in balance</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Dutchman won the case but the Victoria Supreme Court agreed to hear Sauber's appeal on Thursday, a day before official practice starts at the season-opener in Melbourne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Van der Garde claims he was guaranteed a seat for the 2015 season but that Sauber reneged on the deal and instead handed berths to Sweden's Marcus Ericsson or rookie Brazilian Felipe Nasr, who are heavily sponsored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He originally took his case to a Swiss arbitration tribunal which ordered Sauber to keep him on the team.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Victoria Supreme Court Justice Clyde Croft backed that ruling, enforcing it in Australia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Croft said his decision was made purely on points of law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The outcome opened the door for van der Garde, 29, a reserve driver for the Swiss team last year, to compete in Sunday's season-opener, pending Sauber's appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We'll see what comes out tomorrow and I'm still hopeful," Van der Garde told reporters outside court after it agreed to hear the appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I'm very fit and very strong. I'm looking forward to going back to the team, (to) work hard and do our best for the weekend," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Sauber lawyer Rodney Garratt had earlier argued it would be "reckless" to let him compete in an unfamiliar car tailored to another driver and without going through the two-week seat-fitting process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>He said such a move would be "dangerous" and put other drivers and support staff at an "unacceptable" risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Mr. van der Garde has no experience driving the C34 Ferrari and would not have sufficient time to learn," Garratt told the court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>But van der Garde's lawyer Tom Clarke argued that in 2012, a Formula One driver was fitted with a seat just three days after being granted a drive by an emergency ruling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sauber's chief executive Monisha Kaltenborn said the team was "disappointed" with the ruling, in a statement released before it launched its appeal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"What we cannot do is jeopardise the safety of our team, or any other driver on the track, by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers," Kaltenborn said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Van der Garde insisted there would be no safety issues if he was in the cockpit for Sunday's race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"No, not at all. I'm the fittest ever. I've been training the last three months flat-out," he said, adding that despite the dispute he was keen to work with Sauber again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I'm looking forward to going back to the team. I had a very good relationship, I still have a very good relationship, with the team."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Van der Garde, who drove for fellow minnows Caterham during the 2013 season, making 19 starts, said he would be on track at Albert Park on Wednesday afternoon to prepare for the race.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Sauber endured a poor season in 2014, failing to register a single point in 19 races.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But they showed encouraging speed and reliability in pre-season testing with Nasr going fastest on the second day of the first test in Jerez.</td></tr>
