<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ATLANTA - Andres Guardado scored two goals on penalty kicks, including the tiebreaker in extra time, and Mexico beat a short-handed and angered Panama squad, 2-1, in a Gold Cup semifinal on Wednesday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Panama's Roman Torres scored on a header early in the second half, and the 1-0 lead held until Guardado's penalty kick in stoppage time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The penalty kick, which followed a 10-minute delay as tempers flared, set up the extra time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mexico will play Jamaica, which beat the United States earlier, in the final on Sunday in Philadelphia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Panama played a man down after forward Luis Tejada drew a red card and was ejected for his contact with Mexico's Francisco Rodriguez about 25 minutes into the match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Tensions erupted again after the game as Panama's players charged the officials, who had to be escorted off the field by security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Guardado, a midfielder, also scored the decisive goal on a penalty kick in Mexico's 1-0 quarterfinal win over Costa Rica - also on a call that received plenty of criticism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In the 88th minute, a penalty was called on Torres for touching the ball in the penalty area after he stumbled and fell onto it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Panama players protested and fans began to throw debris onto the field for the second time in the match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Chaos broke out on the sideline as players from both teams argued and appeared to be on the verge of an all-out melee before slowly being separated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Following the delay, Guardado's left-footed penalty kick found the right corner of the net for the tying goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Panama was denied its second straight final.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>A header by Torres early in the second half broke the scoreless tie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Torres was in position to intercept a corner kick from Erick Davis in front of the goal, and his header to the ground bounced past goal keeper Guillermo Ochoa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Torres jumped in glee, his fists clinched, as Panama took its fifth straight 1-0 lead in the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>In each of its first four games, Panama took 1-0 leads only to allow the equalizer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>In the 25th minute, Tejada jumped to attempt a header when he hit Rodriguez with his arm and hand, knocking Rodriguez to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tejada protested and had to be restrained by his teammates when the red card was shown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>There was tension from both teams as Mexico players pushed Panama's players away from Rodriguez, who remained on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tejada was very slow to leave the field, stopping and circling back as fans hurled cups and plastic bottles in his direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Tejada's teammate Adolfo Machado attempted to serve as an escort off the field but finally gave up when Tejada continued to linger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Finally, Tejada departed into the tunnel, leaving Panama with the difficult task of taking on Mexico with 10 players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Mexico's Miguel Layun cleared the debris from the field, picking up the cups and bottles, so play could resume.</td></tr>
