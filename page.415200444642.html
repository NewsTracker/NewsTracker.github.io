<h3>Mexico captures Zetas drug kingpin in another blow to cartels</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MEXICO CITY - Mexican security forces on Wednesday arrested the leader of the bloody Zetas drug cartel, the second high-profile capture of a kingpin in the past week and a boost to President Enrique Pena Nieto's efforts to battle organized crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Omar Trevino, brother of captured ex-Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevino, was caught by soldiers and federal police in the northern city of Monterrey before dawn on Wednesday, National Security Commission Director Monte Alejandro Rubido told reporters at Mexico City's airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Trevino, looking overweight and in a light blue shirt, and four other men were paraded in front of the news media, their heads shoved down by soldiers and police, and escorted into camouflaged army vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"For the past few years, he's been one of the country's most-wanted delinquents, with an extremely violent profile," Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Trevino's arrest came just days after the capture of Servando Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug gang, who was the most-wanted crime boss still at large in Mexico.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Zetas have been blamed for many of the bloodiest atrocities carried out by Mexican gangs in a wave of violence that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The gang has been weakened since the killing of former boss Heriberto Lazcano in 2012 and the capture of Miguel Angel Trevino in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Rubido said the operation to catch Trevino began immediately after his brother's capture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>By February, federal forces had begun closing in on him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>On Wednesday morning, they caught Trevino and four other men in two separate operations, Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>No shots were fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Trevino's capture bolsters Pena Nieto, who has seen his security record questioned following the likely murder of 43 trainee students in southwestern Mexico last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The Mexican leader is currently on a visit to Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The United States, which alleges that Omar Trevino is responsible for several abductions and murders as well as cocaine smuggling, had offered up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Among the most notorious incidents pinned on the Zetas are the massacres of dozens of migrant workers, an arson attack on a Monterrey casino in 2011 that killed 52 and the dumping of 49 decapitated bodies near the same city in 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Founded by army deserters in the late 1990s, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But the group struck out on its own in early 2010.</td></tr>

<h3>Kyrgyz government faces confidence vote over donkey meat scandal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In Kyrgyzstan, a country that reveres - and eats - horses, the humble donkey is seen as a poor substitute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For this reason, allegations that a farm outside Bishkek is doing a spritely trade flogging donkey meat to restaurants in Kyrgyzstan's capital have caused much consternation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>And this week, the parliament's committee on agrarian policy has given the government until 15 March to deliver justice for Kyrgyz meat lovers, or face a vote of confidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Investigators promptly opened a criminal case on 3 March against the farm, which denies wrongdoing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The scandal began on 24 February when journalists from state television followed up on complaints from locals, and visited a farm in Sololuk District, not far from Bishkek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gruesome photos emerged online of donkey parts, apparently from the farm's slaughterhouse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Selling donkey meat is not a crime in Kyrgyzstan, but the journalists claimed - without offering proof - that the animals were bound for Bishkek's restaurants, where their cuts would masquerade as beef and lamb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This is a matter of history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Kyrgyz have never eaten donkey meat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Subsequent raids by government inspectors on local cafes have failed to uncover evidence of those claims.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>One chef at a popular restaurant was quoted by local media doubting that donkey meat would be profitable, since it takes hours to cook to tenderness, wasting energy and manpower at the capital's busy kitchens.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>On 25 February, the issue began dominating debate in the raucous national parliament, which has already ousted one prime minister for getting too close to a horse, among other things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"People are being lied to and fed meat that they would never have eaten if they had known what animal it came from," raged MP Saidullah Nyshanov, head of the agrarian policy committee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"This is a matter of history. Kyrgyz have never eaten donkey meat. It is a disgrace."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>MP Esengul Isakov, another member of the committee, added: "Now the country's citizens will be called 'Kyrgyz who eat the meat of donkeys.' Let [the donkey farm] answer for the shame they have brought upon us."</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The owners of the donkey farm have hit back, threatening state television journalists with a court case while maintaining that "every gram" of their donkey meat is exported to a zoo in Hong Kong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We suspect that there is somebody standing behind these [allegations], ruining the investment attractiveness of the Kyrgyz Republic," said Almaz Takyrbashev, head of the firm, Capital, which runs the farm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We will not name names yet, hoping that these people come to their senses. It is not too late to extinguish this conflict and settle it peacefully."</td></tr>
