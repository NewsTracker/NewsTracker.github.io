<h3>Cyclone Pam: Vanuatu death toll rises as Australia pledges $5m in aid ? as it happened</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>It is now night time in Vanuatu and information from the capital Port Vila and beyond is scarce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>We are closing the liveblog down but here is the Guardian's latest report on the devastating effects of cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Up to 75,000 children in Vanuatu could be in desperate need of food, water and shelter, Save the Children has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This disaster has left tens of thousands of children vulnerable and we are particularly concerned for their welfare and safety in the aftermath of cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Children are going to be very afraid, they are going to be hungry and some of them may even have become separated from their families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>An estimated 103,000 people in Vanuatu have been affected by cyclone Pam, with thousands more blighted in nine countries across the Pacific, according to figures from the New Zealand Red Cross.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The aid agency says it has not yet been possible to make contact with the outer islands because power and phone lines are down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It describes the disaster as the strongest storm to make landfall since Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in November 2013, killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Tens of thousands of people are still in the middle of a terrifying ordeal and we need to urgently assess the humanitarian needs and start meeting them as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Information from Vanuatu beyond the capital Port Vila, and from other islands in the path of cyclone Pam, remains sketchy to non-existent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>You can read the latest Guardian report on the situation here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>World Vision International, which has 80 staff in Vanuatu, has posted this detailed update on its work across the devastated island chain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Contact between Port Vila and other islands has not been possible yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Penama Province was directly in the path of the storm, and the cyclone stayed over Tafea Province for approximately four hours on Friday so the organization is extremely concerned about staff and communities in those areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Most families on Vanuatu live in simple, thatched-roof homes that are very vulnerable to severe weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Even for those who safely evacuated to storm shelters, they will likely return to homes that are damaged or destroyed, and crops that are washed away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Cyclone Pam was one of the worst storms the island has ever seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>World Vision's team spent Saturday driving throughout the communities in Port Vila, assessing the situation in the capital city but communications and logistics remain difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Additional information is expected to continue to come in as the team is able to reach more remote parts of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>World Vision pre-positioned relief goods in Port Vila, Santo Island, and Tanna Island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Items include tarps, tools for repairs, water containers, mosquito nets, hygiene kits, baby kits, and kitchen sets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Early warnings throughout the week urged communities to evacuate to local storm shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>More deaths and dire water shortages loom as part of the unfolding crisis in Vanuatu, with the first account emerging of the plight of the South Pacific archipelago's remote communities in the wake of cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A pilot who flew to Tanna - an island of 30,000 people south of the capital Port Vila - on Sunday has told of more deaths, no drinking water and complete destruction of infrastructure and permanent shelters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>It was the first news from outside Port Vila, where eight people have been confirmed dead, thousands left homeless and most civil infrastructure damaged in the aftermath of the category five cyclone on Friday and Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Tanna and the less populated Erromango island had been the focus of concerns from the Vanuatu government and aid agencies, who have no means of communication with anywhere outside the capital after the worst natural disaster in the country's history.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Aurelia Balpe, head of the Red Cross's Pacific operations, said the agency had been briefed by the pilot, who said in Tanna he found "people were waiting to be heard, to talk to someone".</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"What he saw when they landed and took off again was all of the corrugated iron structures were pretty much destroyed, the concrete structures had no roofs left, all the trees had been ripped out," Balpe said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>"People were saying no drinking water. He also reported two deaths but that's not confirmed by government."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A flight over Erromango revealed "a similar state of affairs" to that witnessed in Tanna, Balpe said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Authorities in Port Vila, still unable to assess the true scale of the destruction, were waiting on aerial surveys from an Australian military plane and the restoration of some remote telecommunications towers on other islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Vanuatu lands minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said the government regarded the "entire population" of about 266,000 people as having been affected by the huge storm that ripped through on Friday night and into Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"This is the worst disaster to affect Vanuatu ever as far as we know. We're going to need a lot of assistance," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Australian and New Zealand governments have announced emergency aid packages totalling $6.5m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>An Australian department of defence spokeswoman said a P3 Orion surveillance aircraft had left Amberley base near Brisbane on Sunday to conduct the aerial survey, "weather permitting".</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>It is understood the Vanuatu government as of 5.30pm local time on Sunday was still yet to receive any of the aerial surveillance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>A spokesman for defence minister Kevin Andrews said was transmitted in near real time to defence authorities in Canberra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>The surveillance plane was one of four military planes that flew from Amberley to Port Vila, the other three bearing emergency supplies, medical and disaster teams and aid workers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Balpe said while the fact the pilot found a usable airstrip on Tanna's sheltered western side was an encouraging sign in terms of getting aid through, his account revealed a true emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"The priority is getting someone down to have a look and talk to the local authorities," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Red Cross already had volunteers and emergency supplies in Tanna but "by the impact that he described, those things are just a very small proportion of what is required", Balpe said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>While motorists in Port Vila queued more than an hour for petrol at the solitary fuel station that was open, a landslide and the destruction of several bridges in the city's east made travel outside the capital virtually impossible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>Australian expatriate Kenny Ang, who sheltered from the storm in the northern Efate town of Havannah, told the Guardian he had swum across a river and borrowed a friend's car to make it into Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Ang said he saw "entire villages decimated" on his journey to the capital, where the extent of damage was equally shocking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>"We saw people on the side of the road and they're trying to rebuild in the aftermath but obviously it's going to take a long time before anything gets fixed," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>"We're currently in a queue that's taken one hour to get petrol from the one station that's open. I think it's going to take half an hour to 45 minutes to actually get petrol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>"People are waiting in line with containers and barrels to fill up to get to where they want to go."</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Ang said from Havannah he could see the islands of Moso and Lelepa, "normally a luscious, rolling green, have been stripped bare" by the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Reuters has more comments from Baldwin Lonsdale, the president of Vanuatu, who is currently in Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Sendai, Japan, where he was attending a UN disaster recovery conference, that he fears the impact from a devastating tropical storm will be "the very, very, very worst" in isolated outer islands but damage was still being assessed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>People are finding shelter where they can live for the night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>The state of damage is still being assessed, we do not know exactly the extent of the damage The number of casualties I do hope will be minor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Piecemeal reports are arriving from further-flung parts of Vanuatu as relief workers make their way slowly beyond the capital, Port Vila.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Teouma bridge is gone, blocking access to the most affected areas of Efate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>Community group Humans of Vanuatu reports the almost total destruction of the power infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Power crews are working around the clock to remove downed lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>I have not seen a single undamaged line in two days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>We're talking about rebuilding the entire capital's power grid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>Despite ominous predictions of mass devastation in cyclone-wrecked Vanuatu, policymakers at a UN disaster meeting in Japan do not seem to understand the pressing need to tackle climate change, the World Bank warned Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>A state of emergency has been declared in the impoverished Pacific nation, where dozens are feared dead after one of the most powerful storms ever recorded smashed through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>Aid agencies have spoken of "grave fears" over the scale of the human tragedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>But Rachel Kyte, World Bank vice president and special envoy for climate change, said there appeared to be a disconnect between policy and the increasingly-frequent weather-related disasters the world is suffering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>"I worry that a sense of urgency and a sense of shared ambition is not at the right level," she told AFP in an interview on the sidelines of the UN conference on disaster risk reduction in Sendai, Japan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>"It's hugely ironic that this storm should hit Vanuatu while we are all here. If we truly care for those people, we have to respond," she said, referring to the need for environmental commitments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>65</td><td>"I think we have to hold ourselves accountable and at least voluntarily we should have targets" on emission reductions from the Sendai conference, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>66</td><td>The conference comes ahead of COP 21 talks scheduled for December in Paris, at which countries will try to thrash out agreements on cutting greenhouse gases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td><td>French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who will chair the meeting, told AFP Sendai could act as a springboard to success later in the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>68</td><td>I don't think I would say climate change caused [Cyclone] Pam, but I would say the fact is in the past three or four years we've seen category fives coming with a regularity we've never seen before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>69</td><td>And that has some relationship with climate change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>It is indisputable that part of the Pacific Ocean is much warmer today than in previous years, so these storms are intensifying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>We may have helped communities become resilient to the kinds of storms we experienced in the past, but resilience to a storm with wind speed of up to 300km per hour - that's a whole new intensity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>Unless we tackle climate change on the global level we are making the task of building resilience to disasters almost impossible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>Night is falling in Vanuatu now, with much of the on-the-ground aid effort likely to have to wait until light tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>The C17 aircraft that flew out from Brisbane this morning has just returned, having dropped off its supplies of aid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>75</td><td>More planes will be heading out tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>76</td><td>Following the arrival of military planes earlier today, some food and other aid is being distributed in Port Vila, as the pictures below illustrate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>77</td><td>So far, only the capital is accessible for humanitarian workers - there are reports that roads out of Port Vila are blocked, and bridges torn down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>78</td><td>New Zealand is upping its financial and logistics support for Vanuatu in the wake of cyclone Pam, AAP reports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>79</td><td>The foreign affairs minister, Murray McCully, on Sunday announced an additional $NZ1.5m ($A1.44m; 750,000) of funding, on top of the $NZ1m signalled on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80</td><td>A New Zealand defence force C-130 Hercules transported eight tonnes of supplies and an initial New Zealand team to Vanuatu on Sunday and two more flights will be sent on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>81</td><td>Air Commodore Kevin McEvoy said the Hercules carried first aids kits, tarpaulins, water containers, chainsaw packs and generators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>82</td><td>Specialists from government agencies and the New Zealand Red Cross were also on board the Hercules.</td></tr>
<tr><td>83</td><td>"Pacific nations such as Vanuatu are our friends and neighbours and we're happy we can help at times of need," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>84</td><td>With the main airport being closed to civilian transport, the Hercules load would make a real difference, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>85</td><td>There are 163 New Zealanders registered as being in Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>86</td><td>Cyclone Pam is expected to cause severe weather problems for the northernmost past of New Zealand itself as it passes nearby overnight on Sunday/Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>87</td><td>Baldwin Lonsdale, the president of Vanuatu, has told the BBC that "most" of the population of his country are homeless in the wake of cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>88</td><td>Lonsdale said the cyclone had destroyed most of the buildings in Port Vila, including schools and clinics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>89</td><td>I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>90</td><td>Cruise ship operator Carnival Australia says it has donated $150,000 to Save the Children Australia towards the relief effort in Vanuatu, and says it will be sending fresh water and building supplies on Legend, its ship sailing to Luganville.</td></tr>
<tr><td>91</td><td>The second largest city in Vanuatu is "largely unscathed", it says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>92</td><td>Although New Zealand is not in the direct path of cyclone Pam, its northern areas are expected to bear the brunt of some severe weather as the storm passes close by.</td></tr>
<tr><td>93</td><td>The government has warned people in the northeast of the North Island from Cape Reinga to Hawkes Bay, as well as outer islands including the Chatham Islands, to take precautions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>94</td><td>I've been advised that New Zealand is not in the cyclone's direct path, but we're still likely to experience severe weather in affected areas as it passes by.</td></tr>
<tr><td>95</td><td>Other areas may also experience effects such as increased sea swells.</td></tr>
<tr><td>96</td><td>Our thoughts are with those in countries such as Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Fiji and the Solomon Islands, which have been badly affected by the cyclone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>New Zealand is providing appropriate assistance to our Pacific neighbours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Although I'm advised that Pam is losing strength as it heads south, MetService has forecast severe rain and wind in affected areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Local councils and civil defence teams have spent the last few days informing communities and working with relevant agencies to prepare for potential severe weather.</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>My message to New Zealanders living in affected areas is to make sure you have good preparations in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>This means having enough food and water and an emergency kit on hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>Also, secure outside objects that could blow around in high winds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>We are treating this event seriously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>Although we're not on the direct path of this weakening cyclone, we are still likely to experience severe weather in affected areas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>The New Zealand government has pledged $1.5m to relief efforts in the Pacific islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>AAP is reporting that health is now a major concern in Vanuatu, where power outages have hit the main hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>"We have heard that the generator at Port Vila Central hospital is no longer operational," Oxfam's country director in Port Vila, Colin Collet van Rooyen, said on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>This not only affected patient care but also temperature-sensitive medications and vaccines, which need refrigeration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>Collet van Rooyen said it was one of the problems that came up at a meeting between the high commissioners of Australia and New Zealand and Vanuatu's top officials at the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>Water sanitation and hygiene at the shelters as well as the need for temporary mortuary facilities also emerged as major concerns at the meeting, Collet van Rooyen said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>Oxfam Australia reports from Port Vila in Vanuatu that the cyclone has caused massive, widespread damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>At least 90% of housing here in Port Vila has been badly damaged; the kids have nowhere to go to school; there is no power at the hospital, which has also flooded in parts; and damage to the state mortuary means we need a temporary mortuary set up quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>Clean water, sanitation and hygiene supplies are also a major issue for those left homeless and also those in evacuation centres, where there simply are not enough toilets or clean water for the amount of people in those facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>With extra help arriving on the Australian government plane today we now have a team of 10 people working on this emergency response, and there is a lot of work to be done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>It's becoming increasingly clear that we are now dealing with worse than the worst case scenario in Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>This is likely to be one of the worst disasters ever seen in the Pacific.</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>The Oxfam Australia page for donations to help those affected by Cyclone Pam is here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>Today I announce that the Australian government will provide an initial package of support to Vanuatu, as it responds to the devastation inflicted by Tropical cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>This support responds to a request from the government of Vanuatu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>120</td><td>Australia stands with Vanuatu, our close friend and partner, at this difficult time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121</td><td>Our thoughts and sympathy go out to all those affected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>122</td><td>A first contingent of Australian officials and supplies arrived in Port Vila at approximately 12pm (local time).</td></tr>
<tr><td>123</td><td>Australians with concerns for the welfare of family and friends in Vanuatu should first attempt to contact them directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>124</td><td>If unable to do so, Australians can call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 (option 6), or +61 2 6261 3305 if overseas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>125</td><td>Air Vanuatu has said it will resume some flights between Port Vila and Australia on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>126</td><td>Port Vila airport has reopened with limited facilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>127</td><td>Tuesday flight schedules to be advised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>While information from Vanuatu is coming mostly from the capital Port Vila, as communications remain difficult or impossible with outlying islands, there is also scant detail from the other countries affected by cyclone Pam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>129</td><td>Some of the outer islands have had a very bad couple of nights indeed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>130</td><td>They've had water washing away houses, buildings, community halls, that sort of thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>131</td><td>In addition, because the land is very flat they've had disturbance to some grave sites which is causing a great deal of distress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>132</td><td>A state of emergency has been declared in Tuvalu.</td></tr>

<tr><td>138</td><td>The first shipments of aid headed for Vanuatu on Sunday as authorities declared a state of emergency and global relief agencies geared up after a powerful cyclone tore through the vulnerable Pacific island nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>139</td><td>With winds of more than 300 kph (185 mph), cyclone Pam razed homes, smashed boats and destroyed crops as it struck late on Friday and Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>140</td><td>The official count of confirmed deaths was at eight with 20 people injured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>141</td><td>But those numbers were almost certain to rise as rescuers reached the low-lying archipelago's outlying islands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>142</td><td>Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office said the government still had no word from outside the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>143</td><td>"Our communication link is still down," said Paolo Malatu, a relief official at the office.</td></tr>

<tr><td>150</td><td>He was trying to reach home on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>151</td><td>Red Cross officials said the first aid flight, a New Zealand military Hercules aircraft carrying tarpaulins and other emergency supplies, was cleared to land on Sunday as Port Vila's airport partially reopened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>152</td><td>A UN team was also due in Port Vila on Sunday with members drawn from as far away as Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>153</td><td>Britain, which jointly ruled Vanuatu with France until independence in 1980, has offered up to 2m in assistance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>154</td><td>Aid officials said the storm was comparable in strength to typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people, and looked set to be one of the worst natural disasters the Pacific region has ever experienced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>155</td><td>Offers of help have poured in from around the world, but with communications down, information and access will be major obstacles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>156</td><td>Aurelia Balpe, regional head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told Reuters communications were a huge problem and Vanuatu's medical system was poorly equipped for such a large-scale disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>157</td><td>"The country mostly relies on first aid posts and the supplies in the clinics are probably just antibiotics and pain relief."</td></tr>
<tr><td>158</td><td>On Sunday, Pam was moving away to the southeast, and New Zealand's northern regions were preparing to feel its effects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>159</td><td>Authorities there were warning the public to prepare for damaging winds, heavy rain and massive seas.</td></tr>

<tr><td>163</td><td>Vanuatu lands minister Ralph Regenvanu said there were fears for the level of destruction and loss of life across the country, with communications outside the capital of Port Vila still non-existent on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>164</td><td>Regenvanu downplayed suggestions by an aid agency that the toll in Port Vila alone could hit 50, saying it was "probably less than 10".</td></tr>
<tr><td>165</td><td>However, he said the government regarded Vanuatu's "entire population" of about 266,000 as having been affected by the category five cyclone that struck the archipelago on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>166</td><td>"We don't know anything about the rest of the country but the cyclone affected all of the country, it started right up in the north and went all the way south," Regenvanu told the Guardian after an emergency council of ministers meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>167</td><td>"This is the worst disaster to affect Vanuatu ever as far as we know. We're going to need a lot of assistance."</td></tr>
<tr><td>168</td><td>The government hoped aerial surveys would be carried out with the help of two Australian defence force flights that flew out of Amberley base near Brisbane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>169</td><td>It was not clear when satellite imagery from other countries which the United Nations said would help the Vanuatu government map the scale of disaster will be available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>170</td><td>A private tourist operator, Vanuatu Helicopters, was also set to help with the aerial surveys and the urgent task of re-establishing telecommunications towers on other islands, Regenvanu said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>171</td><td>"Unfortunately we can't communicate with anyone outside Port Vila so there's no way to assess what the situation is," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>172</td><td>"We're hoping the first aerial surveys will be going today."</td></tr>
<tr><td>173</td><td>Preparing the airport in Port Vila to receive more flights is one of the government's priorities, with suggestions that commercial flights could be delayed by as much as a week, a major constraint on aid efforts.</td></tr>
