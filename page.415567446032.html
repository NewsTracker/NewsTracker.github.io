<tr><td>3</td><td>And they recognized that their 80-mile trip to the middle of the state had a lot to do with the place they were leaving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''They were electrifying,'' senior guard Jordan Sibert said of the crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It was the first time since 1987 that a school has played an NCAA Tournament game on its home court, an anomaly resulting from Dayton hosting the opening games.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>''It's a great feeling to be in the tournament still,'' Sibert said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Derrick Marks' leaning 3-pointer at the buzzer was far off the mark, finishing it off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Marks had 23 points on 10-of-21 shooting.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>''They hit a few shots down the stretch that were back-breakers,'' Boise State coach Leon Rice said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Sibert's two free throws tied it at 53-53 with 1:02 left, and his long 3-pointer gave the Flyers a 56-55 lead with 34 seconds to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>After Montigo Alford missed a driving bank shot, Pollard got the rebound, was fouled and missed both free throws with 14 seconds left, giving the Broncos a final shot.</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>''I made a move and I missed the shot,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Marks, the Mountain West Player of the Year, was coming off one of his worst shooting games during a 71-66 overtime loss to Wyoming in the conference tournament.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He kept the Broncos ahead most of the way.</td></tr>

<tr><td>34</td><td>Dayton: The Flyers wore something other than their white jerseys at home for the first time since 2010, when they added a black jersey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Technically, they were the visitors on their home court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Boise State: During the season, the Broncos made an average 8.8 3-pointers per game, which ranked 16th in Division I. They went only 6 of 20 against the Flyers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Dayton: The Flyers will play sixth-seeded Providence on Friday in Columbus, Ohio.</td></tr>

<h3>Whatever Fed does, loan rates won't rise much anytime soon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>When that happens, it will put upward pressure on borrowing rates throughout the economy - for credit cards, mortgages and student loans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But that doesn't mean the era of incredibly low interest rates will soon be over.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Fed's chair, Janet Yellen, has taken pains to be cautious.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>On Wednesday, the central bank gave more signals that it will move slowly toward its first interest-rate increase in nearly a decade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>By the end of the year, Fed officials expect the benchmark rate will reach 0.625 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It was a different world the last time the Fed began a series of hikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Rates were already much higher than today.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>In June 2004, the Fed lifted its benchmark rate from 1 percent to 1.25 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>By the time the Fed was finished in 2006, the rate had reached 5.25 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Nobody expects anything like that now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>With the economy still growing slowly and inflation minuscule, rates will likely hover near historic lows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Fed doesn't want to ratchet up the monthly payments on your credit card.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's in no rush.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"You're going to see rates remain low for quite some time," says Patrick Maldari, senior fixed-income specialist at Aberdeen Asset Management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Many expect mortgage rates to creep higher this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The average 30-year mortgage carries a rate of 3.7 percent, according to Freddie Mac.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That's close to a record low of 3.31 percent and compares with an average rate of 5.9 percent a decade ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, thinks homeowners ought to lock in mortgage rates as long as they remain below 4 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>If you haven't refinanced already, in other words, consider it soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Home loans won't hinge on the Fed's next move, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Mortgage rates are closely tied to long-term interest rates, specifically the 10-year Treasury note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>These rates are tethered to the Fed's benchmark yet have plenty of wiggle room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The 10-year yield has actually been falling over the past year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The reason?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The Treasury market is dominated by global players.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>So when Europe's economy runs into trouble, for example, traders around the world look for safety in the Treasury market, buying U.S. government bonds and pushing yields down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Another factor: The Fed is keeping a lid on yields by sitting on trillions of dollars of Treasurys following a huge bond-buying program that ended last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>It's been a tough time for people socking away money in savings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>On average, savings accounts pay an annual percentage yield of 0.09 percent, according to Bankrate.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>A one-year certificate of deposit pays a paltry 0.28 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>For every $1,000 saved, in other words, the bank will give you $2.80.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Ka-ching!</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"Savings rates are nearly at zero and, unfortunately, I think depositors aren't going to see much of a difference," says Casey Bond, managing editor at GoBankingRates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Fed has signaled that it will raise rates slowly and carefully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>A series of hikes large enough to lift yields on savings accounts, however, could put the economic recovery at risk by curbing lending and business spending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"Anything that would give savers a real boost would be too disruptive," Bond says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>"I think people need to be focused on other things, like avoiding bank fees," Bond says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Fees can wipe out your earnings because savings rates are so low."</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Credit card rates could start to inch up once the Fed raises its benchmark federal funds rate - especially the low teaser rates credit card issuers use to entice people to sign up or shift credit card balances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>McBride advises that borrowers "grab those zero-interest balance transfers and introductory credit card rates. As the Fed moves away from zero interest rates later this year, credit card issuers will too. Chip away at your variable-rate debt now before interest rates start to climb."</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Credit card rates remain high - variable credit card rates average nearly 15.8 percent, according to Bankrate.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>But they could head higher if the fed funds rate goes up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>That's because credit card rates are based on the prime rate that banks charge their best customers, and the prime rate is based on the Fed funds rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>To judge by the stock market's daily swings, investors fear the Fed's first rate increase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Speculation that the Fed is preparing to move usually knocks stocks down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>But the market has actually performed well in the face of rising interest rates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>A recent report from UBS looked at the Fed's initial rate hikes going back to 1954.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>It showed that the Standard & Poor's 500 index rallied an average of 7.6 percent in the next six months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>Many investors are confident that as long as the Fed moves gradually, the stock market should be fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>That's what happened in the last round of Fed hikes, in 2004.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>The S&P 500 finished the year with a 9 percent gain.</td></tr>
