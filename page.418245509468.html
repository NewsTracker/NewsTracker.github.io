<h3>Dutch seek UN tribunal over downing of MH17</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Dutch government is lobbying its political allies for the establishment of a UN tribunal to prosecute suspects in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Flight MH17 came down over territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine a year ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said a UN tribunal would give "the best guarantee of cooperation from all countries" in seeking justice for the victims' families.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>A total of 298 people, most of whom were Dutch passengers, died in the incident.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Malaysia told the UN Security Council yesterday that it plans to push for a UN-backed tribunal, even as Russia described the move as premature, diplomats said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"No route is 100% perfect, but this is the route that is by far the most preferred," Mr Rutte said after a weekly meeting with his cabinet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We also have plan Bs if this approach doesn't work, both national and international, but this is the route that would be the best."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr Rutte's comments confirmed a report by Reuters last month that the Netherlands was seeking to establish such a tribunal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He declined to comment on where the court might be located or how important it would be for Russia, which has a veto on the UN Security Council, to cooperate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Russia denies involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels are fighting Ukrainian government forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Moscow has suggested MH17 was downed by a Ukrainian fighter jet and denied a widely supported theory that the rebels shot it out of the sky with a Russian-supplied BUK missile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Netherlands is leading the criminal investigation, which is also assisted by Belgium, Australia and Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A final report on the cause of the crash is due to be released in October by the Dutch Safety Board.</td></tr>
