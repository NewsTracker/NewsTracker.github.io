<h3>Redmond fired as manager of Marlins after sweep by Braves (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Marlins will have a new manager for the start of a four-game series Monday night against Arizona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>They're not yet saying who it will be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Mike Redmond was fired Sunday after the Marlins were nearly no-hit in a 6-0 loss to Atlanta that completed a three-game sweep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The defeat dropped Miami to 16-22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''We haven't played to our capabilities,'' president of baseball operations Michael Hill said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A news conference was scheduled for Monday morning to announce Redmond's replacement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Bench coach Rob Leary also was fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Redmond had managed the Marlins since 2013, and in his final game, he had a hard time finding anyone who could get a hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Shelby Miller was one out from a no-hitter when Justin Bour singled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Marlins had the same 16-22 record in May 2003 when owner Jeffrey Loria fired Jeff Torborg as manager.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Replacement Jack McKeon led a turnaround that resulted in an improbable run to the World Series title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The Marlins haven't been to the postseason since.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Following a busy offseason highlighted by the signing of slugger Giancarlo Stanton to a record $325 million contract, the Marlins had high hopes of ending their playoff drought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But their bullpen has been woeful, and the batting order has struggled aside from major league RBIs leader Stanton and batting leader Dee Gordon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Marlins have lost nine of their past 13 games and are fourth in the NL East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''We're looking for that consistency,'' Hill said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''We're swinging the bat well at times, but not when we need to do it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>We're pitching well at times, but not when we need to do it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Loria has a reputation for impatience with managers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Along with the early season firing of Torborg, he dismissed Fredi Gonzalez in June 2010, and fired Joe Girardi and Ozzie Guillen after one season each.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Redmond went 62-100 in his first year as a major league manager with the Marlins in 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They improved to 77-85 last year, ending a streak of three consecutive last-place finishes in the NL East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Their 15-win improvement tied for the best in the National League by a 100-loss team since 1986.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>On the final day of last season, Redmond's contract was extended two years through 2017.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Guillen is in the final year of his contract, which means Loria will be paying three managers this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Redmond became the second big league manager to lose his job this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Milwaukee fired Ron Roenicke on May 4 and replaced him with Craig Counsell.</td></tr>
