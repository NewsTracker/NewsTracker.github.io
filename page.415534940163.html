<h3>Madrid find may be Cervantes' remains</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cervantes, often lauded as having written the first modern novel, died in 1616 after requesting burial in a convent in Madrid where, for almost a year, investigators have been searching the subsoil for bones that they now believe to include some of the author's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Everything coincides to lead us to believe that Cervantes is there," a forensics expert, Francisco Etxeberria, said at a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Separating and identifying his badly damaged bones from other fragments will be difficult, researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Almudena Garcia-Rubio, an archaeologist, said that there was "no confirmed genetic identification," although DNA tests were being performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During their excavations, the investigators found decayed wood from a coffin with the letters M and C marked out in tacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cervantes' given name was Miguel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The discovery of the coffin was initially announced in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The whereabouts of Cervantes' tomb had been a mystery since the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians was rebuilt in the late 17th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Etxeberria said the fragments had been "discovered in the ground of the crypt of the current church," Agence France-Presse reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"His end was that of a poor man. A war veteran with his battle wounds," said Pedro Corral, head of art and tourism for Madrid's city council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The team of 30 investigators used infrared cameras, 3-D scanners and radar to identify 33 alcoves where bones could be stored, AFP said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Inside one of niches found against a far wall, archaeologists discovered a number of adult bones matching a group of people with whom Cervantes had been buried, before their tombs were disturbed and moved into the crypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The remains are in a bad state of conservation and do not allow us to do an individual identification," said Garcia-Rubio said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cervantes is most often remembered for "Don Quixote," which gave the world the word quixotic in acknowledgment of its central character and his adventures, including his joust with windmills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The expression "tilting at windmills" also denotes people who take on imaginary adversaries.</td></tr>

<h3>Critic?s Notebook: New Directors/New Films Festival Gives Spotlight to Youth</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The program, a joint presentation of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art, dispels the lingering post-Oscar malaise and imports some energy and novelty from Sundance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Its geographically and stylistically wide-ranging selection of first and second features and short films emphasizes youth - (mostly) young protagonists and (mostly) young filmmakers navigating obstacles and seizing opportunities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The films, always a mixed bag in terms of quality and appeal, offer portents of the future and snapshots of the present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>To sample them is to get a sense of some of the social and political issues that preoccupy emerging filmmakers and also of their role models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>New Directors, for good and ill, can seem like a catalog of trending cinematic influences, an anthology of competent work in the manner of various masters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>This year's overt inspirations included Gus Van Sant, the Portuguese director Pedro Costa and Andrey Zvyagintsev, the Russian director of the Oscar-nominated "Leviathan."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>This is not to say the movies are derivative, only that imitation is often the handmaiden of originality.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>And there is inevitably some dutiful apprentice work here, and there are also glimmers of inventiveness and blasts of imaginative confidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>What follows is a selection of my favorites from the first week of the program, which starts on Wednesday with Marielle Heller's "Diary of a Teenage Girl" and concludes on March 29 with Rick Alverson's "Entertainment."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>(A second article will be published next week.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Based on Phoebe Gloeckner's illustrated novel, Ms. Heller's film tells the story of Minnie Goetze, a 15-year-old in mid-1970s San Francisco.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Minnie, thoughtful, self-critical and sexually curious, lives in a post-'60s world of collapsed boundaries, in which it almost seems like no big deal for her to sleep with Monroe, her mother's boyfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It is a big deal, of course, and there are so many ways the film's handling of it could have gone wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>But Ms. Heller is frank without being exploitative and morally serious without being moralistic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>She is helped by sensitive, subtle performances from Kristen Wiig as Minnie's mother, Alexander Skarsgard as Monroe, and especially Bel Powley as Minnie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Ms. Powley, a 23-year-old British actress with enormous eyes and serious period-appropriate bangs, makes Minnie seem both precocious and childlike, intoxicated by her newly discovered erotic powers and vulnerable in ways she can hardly imagine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>There is plenty here to make viewers uncomfortable - especially, I have to admit, this parent of a teenage girl - but what is most remarkable about Minnie's "Diary" is how fully and unapologetically it honors her point of view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Filmed in a rugged, stunningly picturesque part of Northern Italy, Simone Rapisarda Casanova's slow-moving, meditative hybrid of documentary and fiction consists mainly of an extended visit with Pacifico Pieruccioni, who farms and tends sheep in the mountains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Though he is usually dressed in running shoes and athletic shorts, Mr. Pieruccioni's daily life has a rhythm that seems timeless, and his patience and good humor make him a captivating companion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But the pastoral mood is disturbed by vivid memories of war - German soldiers and Italian partisans battled on these hillsides, and a film crew is busy recreating their battles - and by Europe's present-day political and economic troubles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The grandiosity of the movie's title may seem puzzling at first, but what Mr. Casanova conveys, powerfully and delicately, is the way daily routines and historical forces converge around an individual to give shape and significance to his life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Yuriy Bykov's film, which renders the ugliness of modern Russian life in gorgeous wide-screen compositions, is in some ways a blunter, more floridly melodramatic version of "Leviathan."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Like that film, it depicts a society so rotten and corrupt that decency becomes either stupid or suicidal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Nonetheless, the title character (Artyom Bystrov), a plumber with dreams of becoming an engineer, takes it upon himself to warn the powers that be in his shabby industrial town that a high-rise housing project is in danger of collapsing, threatening the lives of thousands of poor and desperate people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>There are people who would take the idea of an adaptation of Franz Kafka's "Castle" set in Mongolia as a too-perfect parody of a certain kind of art-house cinema.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>There are others who would find it irresistible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>I tend toward the second camp, but this film, directed by Emyr ap Richard (who is Welsh) and Darhad Erdenibulag (who is Mongolian), defies expectations in the best ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Produced by Jia Zhang-ke, the Chinese director responsible for some of the most challenging and vital films in modern cinema, "K" is funny, sexy and odd - Kafkaesque in previously undiscovered senses of the word.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The protagonist (Bayin) is a melancholy, disheveled government inspector - though he looks more like a poet or a street musician - who arrives in a strange town on an urgent but vaguely defined assignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Local folk greet him with hostility and suspicion, an impression that is somehow not lessened by the women who seem to fall in love (or at least into bed) with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Mr. ap Richard and Mr. Erdenibulag respect the inconclusive, shaggy-dog structure of their source, which poses a challenge in a medium that favors logical plots and tidy endings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>But "K" is nonetheless weirdly suspenseful, and also uncannily contemporary - a riff on the theme of modern ennui and frustration that is unsettling and poignant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>This debut feature from Britni West, filmed in Kalispell, Mont., her hometown, with a mostly nonprofessional cast, blithely ignores some of the grimmer conventions of American regional realism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>A loosely bound collection of stories shot in bright, rough 16-millimeter color, the movie follows a half-dozen characters through various emotional and domestic crises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The documentary ambience is complicated by the presence of Alex Karpovsky (Ray Ploshansky from "Girls") as an anxious video store proprietor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>(Even more startling is that the actor speaks flawless Russian.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Ms. West has an easygoing, perceptive sense of character and place, and an almost complete allergy to cliche.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>"Tired Moonlight" has some of the romantic melancholy promised in its title, but it's also full of the oddness and vitality that are essential to the continued promise of American cinema (and American life).</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Or maybe "The Diary of a No-Longer Teenage Girl."</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>The Quebecois writer-director Stephane Lafleur takes up the ubiquitous theme of arrested development in this deadpan black-and-white comedy, in which the 22-year-old title character (Julianne Cote) languishes at her parents' house in the company of her older brother and his bandmates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Nicole has a boring office job and a patient best friend, with whom she is planning a trip to Iceland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Mr. Lafleur faces a challenge familiar to many young North American filmmakers: How to convey the tedium of contemporary life without succumbing to it or loading it up with dubious significance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>His response, which leans heavily on the work of an older generation of hipster filmmakers (Jim Jarmusch most obviously), is to wield the camera with cool, knowing rigor and to allow his star to explore the range of her charm until she finds its limit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Shot in Budapest with a cast of rescued dogs - and some talented humans - Kornel Mundruczo's new film is, in no particular order, a touching tale of a girl's search for her lost pet, an allegory of fascism, a horror movie and a canine variation on the themes in "Rise of the Planet of the Apes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Or maybe it's "Benji: The Hunted" remade as a bloody revenger's tragedy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>In any case, it's something to see, and not quite like anything else in New Directors or out of it.</td></tr>
