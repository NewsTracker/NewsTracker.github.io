<h3>Madrid find may be Cervantes' remains</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Cervantes, often lauded as having written the first modern novel, died in 1616 after requesting burial in a convent in Madrid where, for almost a year, investigators have been searching the subsoil for bones that they now believe to include some of the author's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Everything coincides to lead us to believe that Cervantes is there," a forensics expert, Francisco Etxeberria, said at a news conference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Separating and identifying his badly damaged bones from other fragments will be difficult, researchers said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Almudena Garcia-Rubio, an archaeologist, said that there was "no confirmed genetic identification," although DNA tests were being performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>During their excavations, the investigators found decayed wood from a coffin with the letters M and C marked out in tacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Cervantes' given name was Miguel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The discovery of the coffin was initially announced in January.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The whereabouts of Cervantes' tomb had been a mystery since the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians was rebuilt in the late 17th century.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Etxeberria said the fragments had been "discovered in the ground of the crypt of the current church," Agence France-Presse reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"His end was that of a poor man. A war veteran with his battle wounds," said Pedro Corral, head of art and tourism for Madrid's city council.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The team of 30 investigators used infrared cameras, 3-D scanners and radar to identify 33 alcoves where bones could be stored, AFP said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Inside one of niches found against a far wall, archaeologists discovered a number of adult bones matching a group of people with whom Cervantes had been buried, before their tombs were disturbed and moved into the crypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"The remains are in a bad state of conservation and do not allow us to do an individual identification," said Garcia-Rubio said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Cervantes is most often remembered for "Don Quixote," which gave the world the word quixotic in acknowledgment of its central character and his adventures, including his joust with windmills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The expression "tilting at windmills" also denotes people who take on imaginary adversaries.</td></tr>
