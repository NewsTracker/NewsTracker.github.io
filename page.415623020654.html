<h3>Meningitis B vaccine delay criticised</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A year ago, expert advisers for the government recommended the meningitis B vaccine be given to babies from two months old across the UK on the NHS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But a cost-effective price has not yet been agreed with the manufacturers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Department of Health said it wanted to see the vaccine introduced as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The manufacturers, GSK, said they would be continuing discussions with the government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Meanwhile, meningitis charities are calling for urgent action from the prime minister and the health secretary to conclude negotiations and introduce the vaccine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Meningitis is a bacterial infection that usually affects children under the age of one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>There are about 1,870 cases of meningitis B each year in the UK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Symptoms include a high fever with cold hands and feet, confusion, vomiting and headaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>With early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most children will make a full recovery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>But it is fatal in one in 10 cases - and about one in four of those who survive is left with long-term problems, such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A Department of Health spokesman said: "We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) recommended that a MenB vaccine be introduced, but only at a cost-effective price - below the price published by the manufacturer. We need to make sure NHS funds are used as effectively as possible and negotiations are continuing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>GSK's list price for a single dose of Bexsero - the vaccine in question - was 75, but that figure would not necessarily apply if it was used in a mass vaccination programme, the company said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The company recently acquired Bexsero as part of a recent transaction with Novartis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>What is meningitis?</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Symptoms include a high fever with cold hands and feet, agitation, confusion, vomiting and headaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Sue Davie, from charity Meningitis Now, said: "Too many of our children are needlessly dying or being left disabled due to this lethargic bureaucracy and this government's inability to conclude a deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"How can it take eight months for two parties to negotiate on one item, especially when that item is a vaccine that will save lives and prevent disability?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>She said the UK had one of the world's highest meningitis B rates, killing more of the country's under-fives than any other infectious illness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Matthew Snape, a consultant in general paediatrics and vaccinology at the Children's Hospital, Oxford, told BBC Breakfast it was "very frustrating for everyone involved" that negotiations were still under way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Dr Snape, who works with the Oxford Vaccine Group, which conducted clinical trials on the vaccine, said: "The published suggested cost effective price is between 3 and 7 per dose and the listed price is around 75 a dose, so there's a big discrepancy there and there has been a year of negotiation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"It's very frustrating for everyone involved. Seeing children come in with Men B disease - that's clearly very frustrating."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>But he added: "We can't ignore health economics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"There's a limited budget in the NHS and that has to be used in the most effective way possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Dr Ian Maconichie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said a decision was needed urgently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"One year on, we appeal that a decision is made imminently, so should the vaccine be introduced, it can begin to save children's lives and spare some from severe preventable disability as soon as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>There are several different strains of meningitis infection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Vaccines are already given to babies in the UK to protect against meningitis C.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Last week, Public Health England announced that teenagers would soon be vaccinated against meningitis W after a steep rise in the number of cases.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Prof Snape said the meningitis B vaccine would also protect against meningitis W however, which was another reason he believed it should be introduced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The parents of 16-month-old Harmonie-Rose Allen, who lost all her limbs after contracting meningitis B said they did not want other families to suffer as they had.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Her mother Freya Hall said of the vaccine: "I just don't know why it's not in yet. I am so upset that it's not brought in."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Are you affected by the issues in this story?</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>You can share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.</td></tr>

<h3>Georgians hit by fallout from trouble in Russia, Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rising medicine costs eat up the 64-year-old woman's meager pension of 150 lari ($68) a month, leaving her to live off selling cheap jewelry and other trinkets to foreign tourists at a flea market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Now their numbers are shrinking as this former Soviet republic becomes a casualty of the economic turbulence in Russia and Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Georgia's currency, the lari, has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the dollar since August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>TBILISI, Georgia (AP) - For Mariam Matiashvili, Georgia's crumbling tourist trade is a health risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The 64-year-old woman spends much of her meager pension of 150 lari ($68) a month on medicine and has long lived off selling cheap jewelry at a flea market to tourists, mainly from Russia and Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Now, the number of visitors is shrinking due to the economic crisis in those countries and people like her in this former Soviet republic are feeling the pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"There were some signs of life in January, when suddenly some tourists from Russia, Ukraine and Poland appeared, but since then it's been a complete catastrophe," said Matiashvili.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Some days she makes five lari from tourists, sometimes only one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Georgia, a mountainous nation in the South Caucasus, relies heavily on wine exports and on tourists attracted to the mountains and beaches that for decades made the country a favored holiday destination for the Soviet elites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>While tourists might ordinarily be enticed as Georgia's currency sinks, making travel cheaper, many of those who visit Georgia come from countries facing their own economic problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Georgia's currency, the lari, has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the dollar since August - but Ukraine's hryvnia currency has lost about 60 percent against the dollar and the Russian ruble roughly 50 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Due to the economic tensions, tens of thousands took part in an opposition-led protest Saturday in the capital, Tbilisi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The demonstration was peaceful, despite the bitter political divide between the government team formed by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream party and supporters of former President Mikhail Saakashvili, whose party has been in opposition since losing the 2012 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Those at the protest spoke bitterly of their dashed economic hopes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In the last elections, I voted for Georgian Dream; their promises were very pretty. But now it's become clear that they've fulfilled almost nothing," said demonstrator Tina Khomeriki, a 35-year-old teacher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The government, led by Ivanishvili ally Irakli Garibashvili, insists the crisis has been talked up by political opponents and sensationalist media and is not the result of policy failings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"I think that really an artificial hysteria has been created, especially by the media," Prime Minister Garibashvili said last month in a notably pugnacious response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We have to calm, normalize and stabilize the situation. I want to say that we're doing everything to correct the situation as quickly as possible."</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>While it has been 24 years since Georgia voted for independence from the Soviet Union, the country retains close business links to Russia and Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>As the war in eastern Ukraine, international sanctions against Russia and the sinking price of oil price worldwide have ravaged the economies of those two countries, Georgia has become collateral damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>While the falling lari has made many imports more expensive, it has fallen by less than the Russian ruble over the last year, making exports to that key market more difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>One affected industry is Georgian wine, long renowned in neighboring countries, and which has started to attract the attention of European and American connoisseurs in recent years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Despite producers branching out, Russia and Ukraine remain the top two wine export markets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>In January and February this year, exports to Russia were down 85 percent and those to Ukraine fell by two-thirds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Paata Sheshelidze, director of the Institute of Economic Freedom, said the economic difficulties have been made worse by government policies, including regulations and taxes that he said have restricted development of the private sector.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>The weakening of Georgia's currency, he said, was largely due to an increase in the money supply to cover budget expenses.</td></tr>
