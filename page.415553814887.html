<h3>Wash. state bill looks to cut college tuition up to $5,000</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Last week, the Washington State Senate passed Senate Bill 5954 in a 37-12 vote, a law that would link college tuition rates to average salaries in the state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>If passed, it would effectively cut tuition rates by up to $5,000 per year at public schools.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"If you try and make your decision based on what's best for the students, this bill makes a lot of sense," says Sen. Andy Hill (R-Redmond), the Senate's budget writer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>What doesn't make sense, says Sen. Jeanne Kohl-Welles (D-Seattle), is that no one knows how to pay for it yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The average salary in Washington state is about $53,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The bill links this figure to tuition rates, forbidding universities from charging any higher than a certain annual percentage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The larger research schools, University of Washington and Washington State University, may charge no higher than 14% of the average state salary, which caps their annual tuition at around $7,400.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>This cap significantly slashes the current tuition rates of $12,400 at UW and $11,400 at WSU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Hayley Hohman, the director of legislative affairs with the Associated Students of WSU, says the bill could make college more available to middle-class students.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>She includes herself, citing that she currently works two jobs while enrolled in school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"If tuition keeps increasing, or even stays constant at this point, it's not necessarily accessible for students across the state," Hohman says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Regional colleges, like Western Washington University, Central Washington University and Eastern Washington University would be allowed to charge up to 10% of the average salary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Community colleges could charge 6%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>If passed, tuition reductions would start in fall 2015 and be implemented gradually over the following two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"College tuition has more than doubled in the past 10 years," Hill says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"You should be able to graduate with little or no debt."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Hill says this bill is a step in returning to the old model of higher education funding in Washington state, which was once a 50/50 split between state and university funding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Colleges have increasingly shouldered the burden over the last decade, a difference that ultimately falls to students and their families via rising tuition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>The goal is to reduce tuition to the point where a student could realistically work his or her own way through college, Hill says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We're trying to get back that 50/50 split," Hill says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>However some senators, including Kohl-Welles, have expressed concern over how to make up the $350 million deficit this leaves Washington's universities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I support the intention of the bill to reduce tuition, but unfortunately the bill does not provide a designated revenue stream," Kohl-Welles says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"I'm very concerned about what that would mean for funding for our social safety net."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Kohl-Welles says cutting tuition so dramatically could ultimately hurt the quality of education, especially with the solution to the deficit still up in the air.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Making college more affordable isn't helpful if the value of a degree suffers due to insufficient funding, she says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"What good does it do if students can't get into classes? If you have faculty and staff not wanting to stay?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Kohl-Welles says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The state budget has an additional $3 billion in the upcoming biennium, Hill says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Along with natural economic growth, he attributes this jump largely to the legalization of marijuana, which provides another tax revenue stream for the state's general funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"It's really about prioritizing the budget," Hill says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Ways and Means committee proposed adding amendment that would declare the bill null and void unless a source of funding is found, a proposal which was shot down on the senate floor, Kohl-Welles says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>She expressed concerns over what that could mean for institutions of higher education, which would see their tuition drop regardless of who's making up the difference.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Hohman is also concerned about the financial discrepancy, calling the bill an "unfunded mandate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>However, she supports the legislation, citing the successful tuition freeze in 2013 that forbade Washington's schools from raising their price tags for two years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"A lot of our legislators understand that they cannot create a tuition freeze, but not pay for it," Hohman says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>In the past, progressive reforms in for higher education in other states haven't always proved successful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Last year, Oregon chose not to pursue its "Pay it Forward" plan, which would reduce tuition to zero, but require graduates to pay a percentage of their income back to their college for several years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Oregon's higher education board's reasoning behind killing the plan came down to money - the board found that even a trial run of the plan on a small chunk of students could cost the state up to $20 million per year for more than 20 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Washington state ranks at No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>38 in average student debt, with graduates shouldering an average of $24,418 compared to the national average of $28,400.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>Hohman says that while concerns over financial backing aren't unfounded, students should write to their lawmakers rather than write the bill off entirely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>"If students are looking to get involved, they should contact their legislators," Hohman says.</td></tr>

<h3>UN seeks to endorse military action against Boko Haram</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The draft was circulated as the Nigerian military, bolstered by forces from the neighboring countries, has regained towns and cities held by Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The militant group killed an estimated 10,000 people last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Chad's U.N. Ambassador Mahamat Zene Cherif said Wednesday he hopes for a council vote this month on the proposed resolution, which would endorse the decision of Chad, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria and Benin to establish a force for a period of 12 months to take "all necessary measures" against Boko Haram.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The draft resolution expresses "deep concern" that Boko Haram recently pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It declares that terrorist acts by Boko Haram and others constitute "one of the most serious threats to international peace and security."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The proposed resolution asks U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to establish a trust fund to help finance the military operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It says the fund should be managed by the five countries under the supervision of the African Union.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The draft also calls on the international community to provide equipment and intelligence to the African force, which is headquartered in the Chadian capital Ndjamena, and to assist with the deployment of troops in required.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It was drafted under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which can be military enforced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Council diplomats said there are differences among members on whether the draft should be under Chapter 7 since it is not asking the U.N. to authorize the force - just to endorse it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>There are also differences over who should manage the trust fund, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because consultations have been private.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Boko Haram is already subject to U.N. sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The draft resolution expresses the council's readiness to consider imposing sanctions on additional individuals, groups and entities that are financing, arming, planning, recruiting or using the Internet and social media to support the extremist group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It "demands that Boko Haram immediately and unequivocally cease all hostilities and all abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law and disarm."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>It also demands the release of all those abducted including the more than 200 schoolgirls seized nearly a year ago in northeastern Nigeria.</td></tr>
