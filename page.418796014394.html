<tr><td>15</td><td>Logistical constraints and security precautions prevented Obama from visiting Kogelo, the village where his father lived and is buried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But Obama said once he leaves office and is a private citizen, he'll have a better opportunity to reconnect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"The next time I'm back, I may not be wearing a suit. The first time I came here, I was in jeans and a backpack," Obama said, recalling his first trip to Kenya nearly 30 years ago.</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>CNN later added an editors' note to its story on its website that read: "The headline and lead of this article has been recast to indicate the terror threat is a regional one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>A CNN spokeswoman said the network had no further comment aside from the editors' note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Kenyan troops are deployed in Somalia to counter al-Shabab, and the United States has carried out drone strikes against suspected militants there.</td></tr>

<tr><td>31</td><td>In between meetings in Nairobi, Obama placed a red-and-white wreath at the site of the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy, bowing his head for a moment before studying the names of the victims etched into a brick wall.</td></tr>

<tr><td>33</td><td>Extremists simultaneously attacked the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The Kenya attack killed more than 200 Kenyans and 12 Americans at the embassy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Thousands were injured, including Julie Ogoye, a Kenyan government worker, who was sitting at her desk when the explosion occurred.</td></tr>

<tr><td>37</td><td>"I just want to know what his view is on the issue," Ogoye said of Obama on Saturday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>She said she was grateful for American funding soon after the bombing that enabled her to get medical treatment in Germany.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>With his record on Africa being challenged, Obama pushed back on the notion that America's first black president hasn't done as much as his predecessors to help Africa's development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>In the run-up to his trip, Obama faced comparisons to President George W. Bush, whose PEPFAR program steered huge sums of money into efforts to fight the AIDS epidemic in Africa.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Rather than downplay Bush's accomplishments, Obama said he was proud of the work previous administrations did.</td></tr>

<tr><td>44</td><td>"This isn't a beauty contest between presidents," he told reporters.</td></tr>

<tr><td>49</td><td>Obama said entrepreneurship combined with the electricity initiative will help Africa "leapfrog" over dirty energy - meaning fossil fuels like coal and oil that must be burned - to cleaner sources of energy, like the sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>"It's promising," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>One presenter told Obama that his invention repurposed biofuel, as he showed off a set-up included a device resembling a pot with a hose snaking out from the top.</td></tr>
