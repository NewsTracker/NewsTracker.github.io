<h3>Colo. theater shooter James Holmes? trial to start Monday</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>DENVER - The trial of Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes is scheduled to begin Monday, as the state's gun debate has quieted down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>When Holmes opened fire inside a packed movie theater in July 2012, killing 12 and injuring 70, it did more than spread fear and heartbreak across the Denver suburbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It helped revive the national debate over gun control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>That argument gained intensity in the state five months later when a gunman killed 20 children and 6 adults at Newtown Elementary School in Connecticut.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Democrats in the state legislature in 2013 muscled through new laws requiring universal background checks and banning magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gun control advocates boasted that they had found the formula to enact their policies in a libertarian swing state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Then furious gun rights supporters recalled two state senators who supported the measures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It's in a sort of gridlock," said nonpartisan Denver pollster Floyd Ciruli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The violence issue we're playing out right now is the Ferguson issue (of police shootings). You see nothing coming out in terms of gun control."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Though gun rights groups were successful in the recalls, the pro-gun state senators were voted out in the regular elections last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And, despite big GOP victories, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper won re-election despite signing the gun control laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Guns were rarely discussed in a campaign where Republicans attacked Democrats on the economy and President Obama's health care plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>This year Republicans tried to roll back the new gun laws but failed because they only control one of the two state legislative houses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The gun debate is also shifting westward, away from Colorado.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has vowed to keep the issue alive by spending $50 million to push gun control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Last year his group Everytown for Gun Safety won a ballot fight in Washington state to establish universal background checks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>This year, Oregon's Democrat-dominated legislature is on the verge of approving universal background checks, although, in a Colorado replay, some legislators have been threatened with recalls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>A universal background check ballot measure is scheduled in Nevada next year, which will make it the next western swing state to test the volatile politics of gun control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>John Feinblatt, president of Everytown, contended that his side still has momentum on the issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>He said six states, including Colorado, have adopted universal background checks since Newtown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"This would have been unimaginable a few years ago," Feinblatt said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"I think we are actually winning."</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>There have been plenty of high-profile failures for gun control advocates, however.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A federal universal background bill couldn't muster the 60 votes necessary in a Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate even in the months after Newtown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>And though new gun restrictions have passed in a few states that aren't reliably liberal - Feinblatt pointed to a bill signed last year by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to take guns from people with restraining orders - expanding Republican control over state legislatures has led to a flurry of legislation weakening gun laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>For example, Walker, a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, has indicated that he'll sign legislation ending his state's two-day waiting period on handgun purchases, which would be at least his third expansion of gun rights since his 2010 election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>The National Rifle Association tallied 35 bills expanding gun rights that have been signed into law nationwide this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>No legislation the NRA has opposed has become law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Dudley Brown, head of the National Association for Gun Rights, who is based in Colorado, said he thinks gun control advocates have notched mostly incremental wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>"They seem to be able to pick up an occasional small victory in purple to blue states," Brown said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"If you define those as victories you've got a very low bar."</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Brown said there is still great energy among activists to roll back Colorado's restrictions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>But John Morse, one of the two Democratic state senators ousted in the 2013 recall, doubts that will happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"There's a lot of folks looking around and saying 'wait a minute, the sky didn't fall,"' Morse said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>"The more time goes under the bridge, the more these laws will stick."</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>Laura Carno, an activist involved in Morse's recall, isn't sure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>She noted a Pew poll from December that showed, for the first time in 20 years, support for gun rights exceeds backing for gun control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>But she agreed that the furor in Colorado has died down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>The questions Carno gets at gun gatherings nowadays - including at the National Rifle Association conference in Tennessee earlier this month - no longer revolve around her state's gun politics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>"The question I get is: 'Oh, you're from Colorado - didn't you guys legalize marijuana?"</td></tr>
