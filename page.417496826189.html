<h3>Greek leader defends bailout plan in talks with creditors</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Greece's prime minister entered a showdown with creditors overnight in Brussels, where each side would present proposals in the hope of reaching a deal to unlock bailout loans and save the country from financial disaster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Some officials dampened expectations of a breakthrough on Wednesday, even though Greece is running out of cash and faces debt repayments as soon as Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But French President Francois Hollande said the talks were at least heading in the right direction: "We are some days, not to say some hours away from a possible agreement."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Greece has been negotiating for four months with its creditors over what budget reforms it should make to get the 7.2 billion euros (NZ$11.3 billion) in loans that are left over in its bailout fund.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wednesday's meetings are part of a string of high-level diplomatic efforts to bring the negotiations to a successful end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Ahead of his meeting with Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker, Greek leader Alexis Tsipras stressed the need for compromise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Today more than ever it is necessary for the (creditor) institutions and mainly for the political leadership of Europe to sign up to realism," Tsipras said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Tsipras spoke by teleconference with Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of his meeting with Juncker, a Greek government official said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The three agreed on the need for Greece to have lower primary surpluses " the budget balance without taking into account debt servicing " "and for a solution to be found quickly," the official said, on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Lower primary surpluses than those initially demanded under Greece's five-year bailout have been one of Athens' main requests, although it appears to have been the easiest to overcome in the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sticking points appear to have been labor and pension reforms, as well as some changes to consumer tax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The eurozone's top financial official, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, was also in Brussels and met with Juncker before Tsipras's arrival.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He was less upbeat than others, saying: "We still have a lot of work to do."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>That didn't prevent Greek markets from rising on hopes of a deal, with the main stock index closing up 4.1 percent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Time is pressing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Greece must repay 1.6 billion euros to the IMF this month alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The first installment of just over 300 million euros is due Friday, with other installments on June 12, 16 and 19.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Although Athens insists it intends to repay its debts, it is unclear how much longer it will be able to do so without outside help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>One option Greece could choose is to bundle this month's IMF payments into one on June 30, giving more time for negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>While allowed under IMF regulations, the option is rarely used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Without bailout funds, Greece could eventually default on its debts and crash out of the euro, possibly pushing Europe and potentially the global economy into turmoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"We are working with high pressure" to find a solution, Merkel said in Berlin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tsipras says he submitted his proposal to creditors on Monday night but gave no details of what fiscal reforms Greece was suggesting in return for its final bailout funds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Greece needs the loans because it is locked out of the international bond markets as wary investors demand prohibitively high interest rates to lend it money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The country has not received bailout funds since August.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>So far it has managed to scrape together enough to repay its debts by seizing the reserves of state enterprises, including municipalities, schools, embassies and hospitals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>But those funds will not be enough to sustain the country through the summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Elected in January on promises to repeal the deeply resented austerity measures Greece had to impose in return for its five-year bailout, Tsipras said his government had made concessions during the negotiations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The 40-year-old premier faces dissent from hardliners from within his own radical left Syriza party, some of whom openly say they prefer a rupture in negotiations and even a euro exit, to capitulation on pre-election promises.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>One of the most vocal critics of compromise has been Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"The logic of a deal at any cost ... is a logic of the country's total surrender to the worst neo-colonial regime," Lafazanis was quoted as telling the news website Real.gr Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"A deal will either be compatible with Syriza's progressive program, or it will not exist."</td></tr>
