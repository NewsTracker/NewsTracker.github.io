<h3>US commander: Arming Ukraine increases pressure on Putin</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>While emphasizing the U.S. still seeks a diplomatic solution to the crisis, Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges said in Berlin that helping Ukraine with weapons would increase the stakes for Russian President Vladimir Putin at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"When mothers start seeing sons come home dead, when that price goes up, then that domestic support begins to shrink," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Obama administration is still considering whether to provide lethal, defensive weapons to Ukraine amid concerns that such a move might encourage Russia to further escalate its involvement there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Ukraine and the West accuse Moscow of helping the rebels in eastern Ukraine with troops and weapons; accusations Moscow denies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hodges did not specify what weapons could be offered, but said that what Ukraine wants "is intelligence, counter fire capability and something that can stop a Russian tank."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"If you don't have something that gives muscle to the diplomacy, to the economic aspect, then it's not going to be as effective," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The Russia-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine flared up in April following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hodges estimated that Russia now has 29,000 troops in Crimea and 12,000 in eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For the time being, he said separate American plans to train three Ukrainian battalions had been put on hold to see if a cease-fire deal forged last month in the Belarusian capital Minsk will be fully implemented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>As part of a new NATO rapid reaction force in response to Russian actions in Ukraine, he said the U.S. had decided to bring a brigade of armored vehicles back to Europe consisting of some 220 tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>He said he was recommending they be pre-positioned in locations in the Baltics, eastern Europe and Germany so that they would be available for quick use if needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>That recommendation still needs approval.</td></tr>
