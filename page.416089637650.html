<h3>CIA director says Iranâ€™s economic peril helped drive nuke deal</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>- The director of the CIA has provided the first public glimpse of U.S. intelligence assessments about why Iran's leadership agreed to the tentative nuclear accord last week, saying that Iran's president persuaded its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that their country's economy was "destined to go down" unless he reached an understanding with the West.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The director, John Brennan, speaking Tuesday night at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, also dismissed as "wholly disingenuous" the claim of Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that the framework accord reached last Thursday in Lausanne, Switzerland, would provide Iran with a "pathway to a bomb."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Without naming Netanyahu directly, but quoting from his language, Brennan said that he was "pleasantly surprised" that the Iranians had given up as much as they did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He also backed the Obama administration's assessment that the accord would greatly extend the amount of time it would take Iran to put together a bomb, either from plutonium or uranium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"When I look at the concessions that they made, going from 19,000 centrifuges to 6,000 centrifuges with 5,000 still operating, nobody thought they would do it," Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Brennan suggested that the key to the deal was the election of President Hassan Rouhani.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>It took more than two years, he suggested, for the new president, a former nuclear negotiator himself, to convince the far more isolated Khamenei that "six years of sanctions had really hit," and that the economic future imperiled the regime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>During this time, the ayatollah referred publicly to Iran's "resistance economy," a phrase that resounded among hard-liners who liked to portrayed the country as thriving by confronting the U.S. and its allies.</td></tr>
