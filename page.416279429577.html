<h3>Pro-Russian journalist gunned down in Ukraine</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Police watch as activists demand an end to corruption in front of the parliament building in Kyiv, Ukraine on Tuesday, April 7, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>MOSCOW -- A Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views was gunned down in broad daylight in Kyiv a day after a pro-Russian lawmaker was found dead, local police said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Oles Buzyna, 45, who worked as editor-in-chief of a leading daily until March, was killed early Thursday afternoon by two masked men shooting from a passing car, the Ukrainian interior ministry said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Buzyna, who ran for a seat in parliament on the Russian Bloc ticket in 2012 and was known for his pro-Russian views, was largely perceived as more of an activist than a journalist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He had a three-month stint as the editor-in-chief of Segodnya, a newspaper owned by Ukraine's Russia-leaning richest man, before he resigned in March citing pressure for censorship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The killing is particularly ominous following another high-profile murder on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Oleh Kalashnikov, a lawmaker from ex-President Viktor Yanukovych's party, was found dead on the landing of his home in Kyiv with a gunshot wound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Police would not immediately say whether he was murdered or killed himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister, said in a Facebook post that Buzyna -- like Kalashnikov -- was a key witness in a criminal case related to pro-Russian activists who in early 2014 attacked the pro-Western protests on Kyiv's main square.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The protests eventually led to the ouster of the Kremlin-friendly Yanukovych, who fled the country in February last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Herashchenko called on all witnesses in the case or anyone who might have information about it to contact the police if they fear for their safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The minister said the killings "could be" orchestrated by Russia in order to "destabilize the situation in Ukraine from within."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Speaking at his annual call-in show, Russian President Vladimir Putin described Buzyna's death as a political murder.</td></tr>
