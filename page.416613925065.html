<h3>Egypt president says parliament elections to be held in 2015</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's president said that the country's delayed parliamentary elections will take place before the end of 2015, according to a newspaper interview published Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I give my word - they will be held before the end of the year," President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the daily newspaper El Mundo in an interview published a day before his official visit to Spain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The parliamentary vote initially was set to take place in phases beginning on March 22.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It is the final phase in a transition period following the 2013 ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi by the military, led by el-Sissi at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He says the vote was delayed because of constitutional appeals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Egypt has not had an elected legislature since 2012, when the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that parliament's lower chamber was not constitutionally elected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Meanwhile Wednesday, a criminal court in Cairo's Giza district sentenced 71 people to life in prison over the 2013 burning of a church in the restive town of Kerdasa in the days following Morsi's ouster when security forces launched a violent crackdown on Islamist sit-ins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The sentencing applies to 19 individuals in custody and 52 people tried in absentia, all alleged members of Morsi's now-banned Muslim Brotherhood.</td></tr>
