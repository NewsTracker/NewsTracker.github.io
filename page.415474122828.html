<h3>Netanyahu Maintains Focus On Iran As His Voter Support Falls</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Israel's parliamentary election is Tuesday, and so far, the race is too close to call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It's turned into a referendum on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>I'm Rachel Martin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Israelis hold national elections this Tuesday in a high-stakes race that is too close to call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>It's a parliamentary system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Voters don't directly elect a prime minister but choose parties to fill seats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>But as NPR's Emily Harris reports, this vote looks like a referendum on the leader of the right wing Likud Party incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, known by most as Bibi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>EMILY HARRIS, BYLINE: Twenty-two-year-old Joni Sadon knows who he'll vote for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>JONI SADON: Bibi Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>HARRIS: Why?</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Sadon says Netanyahu knows security, and he just has a good feeling about the prime minister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>SADON: I don't know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I just feel he's the right man to lead us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>You know, Bibi Netanyahu is the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>King Bibi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>HARRIS: Elections this Tuesday could dethrone Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He's led Israel for the past six years, plus was prime minister for one term in the 1990s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But polls show support for him and his center right Likud Party falling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Some voters are leaning away from Netanyahu reluctantly like electrician Shai Lugassi, who worries about the economy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>SHAI LUGASSI: (Through interpreter) I've always voted for Bibi, but I feel like he's been in for a long time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And we need a change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>HARRIS: Others are pushing to see Netanyahu go, like venture capitalist Aaron Menkovski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>He is not impressed with the prime minister's efforts to secure Israel from the threat of Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>He's more worried about rockets coming from Gaza.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>AARON MENKOVSKI: For the first time ever in his tenure, we got rockets to Tel Aviv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>So we have problem, which is much closer before we get to Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>And he have done nothing on Iran as well, other than talk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>HARRIS: Menkovski was in the crowd at an anti-Netanyahu in Tel Aviv last weekend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>On the podium was Meir Dagan, one of a large group of former top Israeli security officials who have been publicly criticizing Netanyahu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Dagan had harsh words only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>MEIR DAGAN: (Through interpreter) For six consecutive years, Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled as Prime Minister; six years in which Israel has never been more stuck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>We deserve a leadership that will stop creating fear and improve our lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>HARRIS: Netanyahu's campaign has focused on security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>In one ad, parents are waiting for a babysitter when Netanyahu shows up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He introduces himself as the Bibisitter, someone Israeli's can trust contrast with their kids.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Speaking Hebrew).</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>HARRIS: But is Israeli pollster Camil Fuchs says some voters have changed their minds about what really makes them secure, especially after Netanyahu criticized President Obama's Iran policy in a controversial speech to Congress.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>CAMIL FUCHS: People say, OK, his speeches are perfect and very convincing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>But what we get now, it is a sense that maybe, in the security issue, Netanyahu doesn't do only good, but he may do damage in losing America.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>HARRIS: In this campaign, Netanyahu has emphasized his efforts against Iran much more than his efforts to reach some kind of peace agreements with Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>Udi Segal covers diplomacy for Israel's Channel 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>He says upheaval in the mid-east, from the Arab spring to ISIS, dampened any interest Netanyahu may have had for a deal with the Palestinians.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>UDI SEGAL: If I want to characterize his policy in the last five years, it simply is bunker in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>HARRIS: Netanyahu might be betting that bunkering in is a good way to win this election.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Many Israelis are satisfied with the status quo on security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>And with no party expected to get a majority in parliament, Netanyahu's Likud could finish behind opponents to the left but still find partners for a new government he would lead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>NETANYAHU: (Speaking Hebrew).</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>HARRIS: In last minute campaign TV interviews, Netanyahu warned of the, quote, "danger" if his center left opponents took power.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Netanyahu advisor Dore Gold says the prime minister's focus on Iran may not resonate with all Israeli voters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>But the messages of great leaders don't always, Gold says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>DORE GOLD: Winston Churchill won World War II and was voted out of office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>So not everyone is thinking about foreign security policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>I think the prime minister will have a tough fight to get reelected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>But I think he has done what he believes is the right thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>HARRIS: Netanyahu hopes the right thing for Israeli voters is to give him a fourth term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Emily Harris, NPR News, Jerusalem.</td></tr>
