<h3>High court throws out Anthony Elonis' conviction for Facebook threats</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Supreme Court on Monday threw out the conviction of a Pennsylvania man convicted of making threats on Facebook, but dodged the free speech issues that had made the case intriguing to First Amendment advocates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for seven justices, said it was not enough for prosecutors to show that the comments of Anthony Elonis would make a reasonable person feel threatened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But the court did not specify to lower courts exactly what the standard of proof should be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Elonis was prosecuted under a law banning illegal threats after he posted Facebook rants in the form of rap lyrics about killing his estranged wife, harming law enforcement officials and shooting up a school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Elonis served prison time for posting a series of statements on Facebook in 2010 after his wife left him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They are now divorced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Elonis claimed the government had no right to prosecute him if he didn't actually intend his comments to be threatening to others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He argued that his musings were protected by the First Amendment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But the Obama administration said the test is whether the comments would strike fear in a reasonable person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Elonis posted these words on Facebook - which a jury agreed was a threat to shoot up a school but which he says are rap lyircs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The only question is.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Did you know that it's illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It's illegal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>It's one of the only sentences that I'm not allowed to say.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Now it was okay for me to say it right then because I was just telling you that it's illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>'There's one way to love you, but a thousand ways to kill you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The high court said it was not necessary to reach First Amendment issues in reversing Elonis' conviction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Elonis said he didn't intend to threaten anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He claimed his posts under the pseudonym 'Tone Dougie' were a form of therapy that allowed him to cope with the breakup of his marriage and being fired from his job at an amusement park.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>His lawyers said the comments were heavily influenced by rap star Eminem, who has also fantasized in songs about killing his ex-wife, Tara Elonis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>But Mrs Elonis testified that the comments made her fear for her life and she persuaded a judge to issue a protective order.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The government argued that it didn't matter whether Elonis actually intended to threaten anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>If the comments provoked enough fear and anxiety to make people feel threatened, that was enough to prosecute it as a crime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>One post about his wife said: 'There's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Those and other comments led to his arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He was sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison and was released last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Elonis was arrested again in April for allegedly throwing a pot that hit his girlfriend's mother in the head.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Police charged him with simple assault and harassment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The case against Elonis started in May, 2010 when Tara, who had married at 16, left her husband and took their two young children, Emma and Riley, with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Even before she left, police had been called numerous times to their home to deal with domestic arguments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Anthony Elonis claimed in court that she left him after she started an affair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>He even suggested online that their pre-teen son Riley should dress for Halloween as 'a matricide' - someone who kills his mother - and parade around the streets with her severed head on a stick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Tara testified at the original trial that she feared for her life and was granted a Protection from Abuse Order (PFA).</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>But even that was not enough to stop her husband's threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>After the hearing, he wrote a lengthy post including the words: 'Fold up your PFA and put it in your pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The aspiring rapper also posted lyrics he had written about attacking little children at a school.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>After a woman FBI agent arrived to question him, he threatened her too: 'Little agent lady stood so close, took all the strength I had not to turn the bitch ghost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Elonis' lawyers argued his statements were little different from lyrics by performers like rapper Eminem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>He even posted a diagram of Tara's father's house - where she had fled after leaving him - to show how he could attack it and make a clean getaway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>In U.S. District Court in 2011, Tara confirmed it was an accurate depiction of the property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>'I felt like I was being stalked,' she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>But Elonis claimed the threats were to help him work through his anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>'I was basically listening to love songs and getting depressed,' he told the federal court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>Five months after Tara walked out, Elonis lost his job attending rides at Dorney Water Park for posting a picture of himself and co-worker Amber Morrissey on Facebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>He was dressed in a demon costume with a blade up against Amber's neck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>Morrissey testified in the original case that she felt threatened because she had earlier filed sexual harassment complaints against Elonis after which he had been demoted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>In October 2010 he posted: 'Someone once told me that I was a firecracker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Nah, I'm a nuclear bomb and Dorney Park just..</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>with the timer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>After his firing, he claimed online that he had the keys to the park and would break in during its Halloween Haunt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Morrissey said she was so terrified that she picked out a hiding place in case he made good on his threats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>'Even without a paycheck, I'm still the main attraction,' he taunted the park's management.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>'I was extremely concerned,' park security boss Daniel Hall testified in court.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Elonis was convicted under a law prohibiting anyone sending threats through interstate commerce - in his case, the Internet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>He was sentenced to almost four years in prison, but the conviction was today overturned.</td></tr>
