<h3>Australia joins call for UN criminal tribunal to prosecute MH17 suspects</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and the countries investigating the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 have called on the United Nations to establish a criminal tribunal to prosecute those responsible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine want the UN Security Council to set up an independent tribunal to "try those responsible for crimes" connected to the tragedy, which claimed 298 lives on July 17 last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop speaks to members of the Security Council last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine consider an independent international criminal tribunal established by the Council, reflecting the highest international standards, would be the best means of ensuring justice for the victims and their loved ones," Ms Bishop said on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"It would also be an appropriate response to the fact that the incident and the related implications for the safety of civil aviation affect the interests of the international community as a whole."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Thirty-eight Australians were killed when the flight was shot down over territory in Ukraine held by Russian-backed rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Australian Federal Police and their Dutch counterparts at the MH17 crash site outside the village of Grabovka.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Five countries involved in the Dutch-led investigation want the tribunal resolution in place before the expected October release of the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Australia, along with other nations who lost citizens, fear that once the much-anticipated Dutch Safety Board investigation recommends prosecutions against pro-Kremlin separatists and even Russian nationals, Moscow will wield its veto power in the UN Security Council to stop a tribunal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The establishment of an international criminal tribunal under Chapter VII of the UN Charter for this purpose would send a clear message that the international community will not tolerate acts that threaten international peace and security by endangering civil aviation," Ms Bishop said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"A tribunal established by the Council would ensure broad international support for prosecutions and would maximise the prospects of securing international cooperation, which will be necessary for an effective prosecution."</td></tr>
