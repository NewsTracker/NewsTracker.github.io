<h3>Egypt court bans popular, hard-core 'ultra' soccer fan clubs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CAIRO (AP) - An Egyptian court has banned the country's hard-core soccer fan associations, known locally as "ultras," over accusations that the groups are involved in terrorism.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The ruling Saturday at the Court of Urgent Matters in Cairo outlaws the fan organizations for soccer clubs across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ultras frequently clash with police inside and outside of stadiums.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>They are deeply politicized and many participated in the country's 2011 uprising that forced out autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Many consider them as one of the most organized movements in Egypt after the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, which the government outlawed as a terrorist organization following the 2013 military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</td></tr>
