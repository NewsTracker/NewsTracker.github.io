<h3>Powerful Cannes film 'Mediterranea' humanizes migrants</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Director Jonas Carpignano poses for a portrait to promote his film Mediterranea at the 68th international film festival, Cannes, southern France, Thursday, May 21, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It may be the most topical film at Cannes - but "Mediterranea" - a searing account of a desperate African migrant who travels by boat from Burkina Faso to Italy - is not just pulled from the headlines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>It's been years in the making and is based on a true story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>First time director Jonas Carpignano - who's half African-American, half-Italian - evoked the real-life experiences of his roommate and lead actor in the film, Koudous Seihon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Seihon witnessed shootings, race riots, violence and faced near-constant discrimination after he took the perilous trip by foot, car, bus and boat to southern Italy as a 20-year-old father seeking to support his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Despite its small 1 million-euro ($1.1 million) budget, Carpignano's film, which was screened at the Critics Week, has already garnered great attention for its highly personal portrayal of Europe's great migrant crisis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We're constantly bombarded and desensitized (about migrants). That's why I wanted to make a film about this, to give people something to latch on to," Carpignano said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It doesn't help to constantly group immigrants as just migrants coming over. There has to be more of a personal angle."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The film's power comes from its documentary-style shooting and from the charismatic Seihon, who plays the enigmatic character of Ayiva with understated grace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"The idea of the film was to let people in through one specific character, through Ayiva," the director explained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"He's never pathetic and (he's) strong, despite having nothing. I hope the audience finds him charismatic and charming - which I of course do, as he's my friend."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Ayiva manages to keep our sympathies as an essentially innocent man fighting to survive in a racist, hostile community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The character puts a human face on stories like last month's tragedy, where a boat off the Italian island of Lampedusa capsized, drowning an estimated 800 migrants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Carpignano said he hopes the film moves the conversation from tragedies on the sea to the equally important issue of what happens to migrants once they have reached Europe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"There needs to be a lot more attention to what happens afterward. ... This is not a fleeting thing. It's changing communities," said Carpignano.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"This is not going away."</td></tr>
