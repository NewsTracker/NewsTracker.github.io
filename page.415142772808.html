<h3>Bali nine executions: Andrew Robb shelves trade delegation to Indonesia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Major events at the largest Indonesian festival in Australia - INDOfest - have also been postponed because of fears that a family fun day would be seen as insensitive and incongruous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>And Australian firms are delaying doing business with Indonesia due to uncertainty about any post-execution fallout, such as embargoes or the recalling of the Australian ambassador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Last year Mr Robb said one of his goals as trade minister would be to make Indonesia one of Australia's top 10 trading partners.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Austrade CEO Bruce Gosper told a conference in December that Mr Robb would lead a trade delegation to Indonesia in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>However that has now been put on ice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A spokeswoman for Mr Robb's office said the minister intended leading a business mission to Indonesia this year at an "appropriate time".</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"At this point no dates have been locked in," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Strengthening Australia's economic relationship with Indonesia remains an important priority."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Australia Indonesia Business Council president Debnath Guharoy said the executions were not "helpful" as far as business was concerned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"As I understand it, because of the current state of affairs it would not be an appropriate time for the minister to visit and talk business," Mr Guharoy said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Trade minister Andrew Robb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Almost without exception we have one unfortunate event a year on average - if not more - between the two countries. If it's not cattle, it's boats. If it's not boats, it's [tapping of] phones."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>However he said both countries were accustomed to the turbulent relationship and it did not stop business getting done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Indonesia Institute president Ross Taylor said given the current state of the relationship, it was "logical and sensible" not to proceed with the delegation in March.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>He said a trade delegation was vitally important but would be seen as disrespectful to the families if timed within weeks of the executions, and could pave the way for protests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>INDOfest, which has been held annually in Adelaide since 2008, was expected to attract up to 15,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>However major events, including a family day in the park on April 12 and a trade forum, were cancelled as sponsors pulled out and concerns were raised that visiting Indonesian dignitaries could be embarrassed and local Indonesians put at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"We decided that in the current context it would not be appropriate and rather insensitive to go ahead with the larger events," said Australian Indonesian Association of South Australia secretary Chris Majewski.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Australia's trade relationship with Indonesia is underdeveloped, despite the proximity of the two nations and the enormous opportunities in a country with a population of 250 million and a growing middle class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Two way trade with Indonesia was worth just $14.9 billion in 2013, making Indonesia only Australia's 12th-largest trade partner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"In contrast with the $46 billion invested in New Zealand, a country of 4 million, the sum total of Australian investment in Indonesia stood at a paltry $9 billion at the end of 2013," Mr Guharoy told the conference in December.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Only about 400 Australian businesses have a presence in Indonesia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>International trade and investment specialist Danny Burrows said he was seeing significant strategic decisions being put off because of the the executions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"From the Australian side I've seen a reticence to conclude joint venture agreements or finalise customer relationships because people are unsure what's going to play out, such as embargoes or the diplomatic recall of the ambassador.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"I've seen outcomes delayed in both infrastructure as well as businesses in the consumer sector such as manufacturing," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Mr Burrows said he was urging his clients with interests in Indonesia to touch base and visit if possible.</td></tr>
