<h3>Gay rights groups tell UN Islamic State killed 30 people for sodomy</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>UNITED NATIONS - Syrian refugee Subhi Nahas watched in fear as the Al-Qaida-linked group Nusra Front took over his home town of Idlib and began torturing and executing men suspected of being gay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Then, with the rise of Islamic State, came videos of gay men being hurled from buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>If the victims did not die from the fall, they were stoned to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"This was to be my fate, too," Nahas told a closed-door informal meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The meeting was organized by the United States and Chile to draw attention to "brutal attacks" by the militants.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I was terrified to go out. Nor was my home safe, as my father, who suspiciously monitored my every move, had learned I was gay. I bear a scar on my chin as a token of his rage," said Nahas, according to a text of his prepared remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said this was the first time the U.N. Security Council had discussed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It is impossible not to take up the struggle for their rights as our own as we have other great human rights struggles," she told the meeting, according to her prepared remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Today, we take a small but important step in assuming that work. It must not be our last step."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Security Council members are not required to attend informal meetings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Angola and Chad were not present, diplomats said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The meeting was also open to all other U.N. member states.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Islamic State has declared a caliphate in territory it has seized in Iraq and Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>An Iraqi man identified as Adnan told his story to the Security Council by telephone from an undisclosed location, as he said he was still not safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"In my society, being gay means death and when (Islamic State) kills gays most people are happy because they think we are evil, and (Islamic State) gets a good credit for that," he said, according to his prepared remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"My own family turned against me when (Islamic State) was after me," said Adnan, who fled his home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"If (Islamic State) didn't get me, members of my family would have done it."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Adnan said Islamic State militants hunt down gay people through cell phone and Facebook contacts of people they capture.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Nahas fled Syria to Lebanon, then moved to Turkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"Death threats followed me to Turkey. A former school friend from Idlib named Khalil had joined (Islamic State). He relayed through a mutual friend that he wanted to kill me, aiming to go to paradise," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I was terrified."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Nahas has settled in the United States and works with the Organization for Refuge, Asylum, and Migration to help governments and refugee agencies build their capacity to protect LGBT refugees.</td></tr>
