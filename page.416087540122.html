<h3>Messi, Suarez score in Barcelona's 4-0 win over Almeria</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Barcelona's 20th win in 21 games in 2015 lifted it seven points clear at the top of the table before Madrid visits crosstown rival Rayo Vallecano later Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Messi undid Almeria's defense with a curling shot to open the scoring in the 33rd minute at Camp Nou.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Suarez struck from near the same spot with a blistering shot in the 55th and scored again in stoppage time after Marc Bartra had added a goal of his own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"We know that if we are not focused we won't take the three points, and if we don't do that we won't win the league," Suarez said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"We only depend on ourselves and have to keep going forward like this."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Barcelona now faces a demanding two-week stretch with league games against Sevilla and Valencia, along with a Champions League quarterfinal against Paris Saint-Germain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Elsewhere, bottom-side Cordoba drew 1-1 at 10-man Deportivo La Coruna to end a 10-game losing streak.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Barcelona manager Luis Enrique rested several first-choice players, including Neymar and Andres Iniesta, to prepare for the run of upcoming matches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But his side still dominated possession and created scoring chances throughout, although Almeria's defensive strategy to pack its area limited the hosts to a pair of timid strikes until Messi broke through.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Almeria appeared to have Messi under control when he received the ball pegged to the right sideline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>But Messi made one move to shed a defender, and once inside the area wasted no time in bending an unstoppable left-footed strike around goalkeeper Julian Cuesta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Messi's goal was his 44th in 43 games in all competitions this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It took his tally in the league to 33, second only to Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo with 36.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Suarez also continued his strong scoring run over the last two months by recording his 15th and 16th goals in 31 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Suarez's first goal also included him receiving a seemingly harmless ball on the right side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>But just like Messi, Suarez dribbled past one Almeria player and then unleashed a left-foot shot that Cuesta got a hand to but couldn't keep out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Bartra's headed goal from a corner in the 75th was the team's third goal in as many games from a set piece, an area the Catalan club struggled at before the arrival of Luis Enrique this campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Suarez completed the rout after Pedro Rodriguez drew Cuesta off his line and set up Suarez to steer the ball into the open net on the break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Almeria's loss left the club in the relegation zone and marked a disappointing debut for former Barcelona coach Sergi Barjuan, its third manager of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Cordoba's Florin Andone scored both goals in the night's other early kickoff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He started out by putting his own team ahead in the 55th minute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But after Deportivo had been reduced to 10 men when Luis Correira earned his second booking, Andone scored an own goal with three minutes left.</td></tr>
