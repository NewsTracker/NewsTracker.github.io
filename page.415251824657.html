<h3>Apple to Replace AT&T in Dow Jones Industrial Average</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>S&P Dow Jones Indices said the switch will take place after the close of trading on Wednesday, March 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Apple will start trading as part of the 30-stock Dow at the opening of trading the following day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>S&P Dow Jones Indices said it's making the move in response to a planned stock split for Visa, another member of the 119-year old barometer of the stock market.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After its four-to-one stock split, Visa will wind up with a lower price.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>S&P said that would reduce the weight of the information technology sector in the Dow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Adding Apple will help balance out this reduction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Unlike other stock market measures, the Dow weighs members by their prices, so a large change in the price of one stock can have a big effect on the overall index.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>S&P said swapping Apple for AT&T won't alter the Dow's level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The last big shake-up came in September 2013 when Goldman Sachs, Nike and Visa knocked out Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Apple's stock rose $2.55, or 2 percent, to $128.99 in early trading on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>AT&T sank 46 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $33.54.</td></tr>

<h3>Don Young, Alaska Republican: Best way to solve homeless problem is let wolves run free</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Don Young, who is well-known for his bluntness, posed the idea during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing on the Interior Department's budget, The Washington Post reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"How many of you have got wolves in your district?"</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr. Young asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"None. None. Not one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>They haven't got a damn wolf in their whole district," Mr. Young added, The Post said. "</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>I'd like to introduce them in your district.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Mr. Young, who has pushed for the removal of gray wolves from the endangered species list, reportedly made the comment in an attempt to demonstrate that the Interior Department routinely makes financial decision across the board without consulting the states that they affect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A spokesman for Mr. Young told The Post that the "analogy was purposely hyperbolic to stress the point that these predators pose serious threats to wildlife management and their listing has damaging impacts to local communities."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>This isn't the first unusual solution to a problem that Mr. Young has posed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The 22-term congressman once suggested that social drinking leads to domestic abuse and suggested drinking alone as a solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"If you want to drink by yourself, you may do it. But when you drink together, the possibility of harm becomes greater every day," he told a group of Wasilla high school students in July, The Post reported.</td></tr>
