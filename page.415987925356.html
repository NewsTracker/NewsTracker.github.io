<h3>Foligno's 3 goals help Jackets beat Pens for 9th straight (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They'd better in the final week of the season if they want to make the playoffs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nick Foligno scored three goals for the first time in his 541st NHL game and the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Penguins 5-3 on Saturday to set a franchise record with their ninth consecutive win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Penguins, viewed as one of the league's elite teams, are desperate for wins coming down the stretch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>''We need points,'' Crosby said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>''It's not a surprise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Although still likely to make the postseason, the loss certainly didn't make it any easier for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Pittsburgh came in with 95 points, hanging on to the first wild-card spot in the East with a shot at moving up - but also in jeopardy of adding even more drama to the stretch run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Now just 3-7-1 in their last 11 games, they are more than a little worried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>''Every team that (hasn't locked up) a playoff spot right now, that's their biggest concern,'' said coach Mike Johnston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Crosby and Brandon Sutter scored and Ian Cole had two assists for the Pittsburgh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Marc-Andre Fleury made 29 saves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Defenseman Rob Scuderi was asked if the Penguins were more angry or frustrated after blowing a 2-0 lead for the third time in six games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>''It's both,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>''We just didn't deserve this game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>We didn't deserve to win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Meanwhile, the Blue Jackets have already been eliminated from the postseason but are the hottest team in the league.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''It's fun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It shows the character of this group,'' said Brandon Dubinsky, who assisted on all three of Foligno's goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Matt Calvert and Scott Hartnell also scored for the Blue Jackets, who won for the 11th time in 13 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Sergei Bobrovsky made 33 saves and Marko Dano added two assists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The Blue Jackets scored four goals in a row after trailing 2-0 late in the second period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>They've come from behind in their last nine victories, a franchise record, and in 11 of their last 12 wins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>''The way it's going, I think we should pull our goaltender the first 5 minutes, give them a couple of goals and then play,'' coach Todd Richards joked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Foligno and Calvert scored 2:03 apart to tie the score late in the second.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Then Foligno notched his second when he stole the puck by reaching around Derrick Pouiliot near the blue line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>On a 2-on-1, Dubinsky's shot was blocked by Fleury with his right shoulder but Foligno cleaned up the rebound at 6:46 of the third.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Hartnell extended the lead to 4-2 when he jammed in a loose puck at 9:29 after a lengthy scrum with Fleury sprawled on the ice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>After Ben Lovejoy cut the lead to 4-3, Foligno added an empty-netter with just under a minute left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>''It's special.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Amazing, actually,'' Foligno said of finally filling the ice with fans' hats.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>It was the third time a Blue Jacket had scored three goals in the last six games, with Scott Hartnell and Cam Atkinson also pulling it off in the last 11 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>None had done it for two years before the latest flurry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>''The hat-trick flu is going around the team,'' said Dubinsky.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Notes: Penguins C Evgeni Malkin missed his second straight game with an undisclosed injury.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>... Columbus has also won a franchise-record eight in a row on the road heading into Monday's game at the New York Rangers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>... D Taylor Chorney, called up from AHL Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Friday, played in his third game for Pittsburgh this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>... The Blue Jackets play two of their final four at home.</td></tr>
