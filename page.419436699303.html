<h3>Holland returns as homer-happy Rangers beat Mariners 7-2 (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers' chances of contending for a postseason berth will improve if Derek Holland delivers more pitching performances like Wednesday's.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Holland won in his return from a four-month stint on the disabled list, and Texas hit back-to-back-to-back home runs in the seventh inning as the Rangers beat the Seattle Mariners 7-2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Rangers completed a 5-1 homestand and have won 12 of their last 16 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Holland (1-1) scattered eight hits, struck out six and walked none over 6 1-3 innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He was activated from the DL on Wednesday following a shoulder injury suffered in his season debut on April 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>''These guys have been playing their tails off this whole year, and I haven't been able to help out,'' Holland said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Mitch Moreland and Elvis Andrus each had three RBIs and hit homers that sandwiched Mike Napoli's 446-foot blast to center off Joe Beimel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>It was the eighth time in franchise history that batters hit three consecutive homers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Napoli's homer was the 200th of his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Seattle left-hander Mike Montgomery (4-6) allowed three runs and five base runners in the first, but shut out Texas over the next five innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Holland, 28, resembled the pitcher who compiled a 3-0 postseason record for Texas in its pennant winning years of 2010-11.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>In 2014, he suffered a knee injury in January that limited him to six September appearances, five starts, during which he compiled a 1.46 ERA.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Holland started the Rangers' home opener this season against Houston.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>He gave up one run on two hits in the first inning and then exited with a torn shoulder muscle after nine pitches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>''This is a guy who's been on a mission since the last time we saw him,'' Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said he was surprised by Holland's effectiveness in his first major league start since April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''He came right out of the gate, throwing 92, 93,'' McClendon said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>''He's a big-game pitcher.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Holland threw scoreless ball until Mark Trumbo hit his 15th homer of the season - his sixth since joining Seattle - in the fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The Mariners loaded the bases on three straight singles in the sixth but scored just one run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Rangers center fielder Delino DeShields, a converted infielder, made two standout defense plays behind Holland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>DeShields made a running catch at the warning track to rob Nelson Cruz of an extra-base hit in the fourth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>In the seventh, he threw out Jesus Montero at home trying to score the tying run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>''His arm has gotten better,'' Banister said of DeShields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>OF Josh Hamilton missed his fourth consecutive game with a sore left knee and said he wasn't sure he would be able to play Thursday at Detroit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Hamilton said he hopes he isn't put on the disabled list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>''What if I go on the DL and three days from now my knee pops and, damn, it feels good?'' he asked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Mariners: LHP James Paxton (strained left middle finger) is scheduled for light throwing Friday and could begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Tacoma on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Rangers: Banister said closer Shawn Tolleson recently hurt his right foot stepping on first base but X-rays showed no damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Mariners: Seattle will be off Thursday, its third day off in the past 15 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>The Mariners will open a six-game homestand on Friday against the Chicago White Sox.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>RHP Felix Hernandez (14-7) is scheduled to pitch against LHP Chris Sale (11-7).</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>Rangers: LHP Martin Perez (1-2) has made six starts since being activated after the All-Star break following Tommy John surgery last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>His performance has been erratic - he allowed eight earned runs in one inning against the Yankees, but has also taken a shutout into the ninth against the Giants.</td></tr>
