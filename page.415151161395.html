<h3>Nemtsov murder witness says she is blocked from leaving Russia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>They met three years ago, by some accounts on holiday in Turkey, and soon enough became a couple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Though she was less than half his age, Anna Duritskaya, a Ukrainian model, was often with Boris Nemtsov, a beleaguered Russian opposition leader, including on Friday evening, when a gunman carried out the highest-profile political assassination in Russia during the tenure of President Vladimir Putin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov's companion Anna Duritskaya tells a Russian TV station she is being held against her will by Russian investigators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Duritskaya is now a primary witness to the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In interviews with Russian news media on Monday, Duritskaya said the Russian police were not allowing her to return to Ukraine, though they had not formally detained her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Her uncertain status has drawn objections from Ukraine's Foreign Ministry and her Russian lawyer, who has said the action has no legal basis under Russian law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The development comes in a case that Western officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, have implored Russia to solve swiftly and openly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Kremlin had no official comment on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Duritskaya, 23, said in a Skype and telephone interview with Dozhd, a Russian television station, that she was staying at the apartment of an acquaintance in Moscow and had been placed under round-the-clock guard by the police, who she said were holding her against her will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Boris Nemtsov was gunned down on Friday evening a he walked with Anna Duritskaya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"I now have the status of a witness," Duritskaya said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"I gave all testimony that was possible, and I don't understand why I am still on the territory of the Russian Federation, as I want to leave to be with my mother, who is sick and in a difficult psychological state."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"I don't understand what else I can do, and why they cannot let me go," she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Duritskaya said she waited on Friday evening in the Bosco cafe in the GUM department store on Red Square for Nemtsov to finish an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The two had dinner and then started the walk home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>People march in memory of Russian opposition leader and former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov in central Moscow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>At no point, she said, did she notice anything suspicious, and she suggested that she had little to help investigators, because the gunman had shot Nemtsov in the back as the couple walked side by side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Nemtsov, 55, a long-standing proponent of democratic reforms who had been in and out of jail, crumpled on the sidewalk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>By the time she looked back, she said, she saw neither the gunman's face, nor the licence plate of the getaway car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>She ran to a nearby snowplow machine, she said, to ask for help, then returned to the body and waited, by her account, about 10 minutes for the police to arrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The relationship of the older, famous politician and the young model from a country many Russians now believe to be their enemy has drawn intense interest from Russia's tabloid press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Model Anna Duritskaya was the one witness of the killing of Boris Nemtsov.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The Investigative Committee, the law enforcement organisation with the lead on the case, has said it is examining a variety of possible motives for the murder, including that fellow members of the opposition killed him to create a martyr and that Islamist terrorists might be to blame, but that conflicts in his personal life might be the root.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>More than a few Russian commentators and politicians floated the idea of jealousy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian nationalist politician, for example, said of Nemtsov's romantic life, "This young girl was not the first."</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Zhirinvosky said his former colleague in Parliament "was always changing his partners, changing wives."</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Duritskaya, in the interview, denied that either of them had received threats from jealous former lovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, citing investigators, reported that Duritskaya had "forgotten" crucial moments of the shooting on a bridge over the Moscow River, and cited unnamed experts saying that investigators might have to wait until she underwent a course of psychological treatment, to overcome shock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Asked in the Dozhd interview what had happened on the bridge, Duritskaya said flatly "on the bridge, the murder of Boris took place."</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>She told the Russian television channel that the investigators had not prohibited her from talking about the killing, though it remained an open question whether she might speak more freely about the shooting once outside the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Her lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, has said that the refusal to allow Duritskaya to return home to Ukraine violated Russian law, as his client had declined a program for witness protection and could not be held under other pretexts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>LifeNews, one Russian television station that has delved into the relationship, interviewed a friend of Duritskaya's, who said the couple "were really tied by genuine feelings."</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"They started to live together almost immediately," the station cited the friend, identified only by her first name, Yulia, as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>"The couple was almost never apart."</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Nemtsov, a physicist turned politician, was separated from his wife and children, and his career had fallen precipitously from the days when he was seen as a successor to Boris Yeltsin to be leader of Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>But he was still a witty and driven and admired man, with a politician's charm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>He was killed just days before he was to lead a rally to protest the war in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>Duritskaya was a provincial girl who found some success in the Ukrainian capital, working for the agencies Amodels and Kiev-Casting, appearing in advertisements available online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>When war came to their countries, Nemtsov met with the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, who later said he had tried to be a "bridge" between the two nations in conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>On Monday, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling on the Russian authorities to release Duritskaya and allow the return "of this citizen of Ukraine to her homeland."</td></tr>

<h3>Round two of right-to-work fight begins at Wisconsin Capitol</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Bob Kulp, R-Stratford, asks a question of a person providing testimony during a public hearing of the Assembly labor committee regarding Right to Work legislation at the State Capitol in Madison, Wis., Monday, March 2, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Electricians, pipefitters, carpenters and other union members opposed to making Wisconsin the 25th right-to-work state dominated more than 11 hours of testimony Monday on a fast-tracked proposal expected to pass the Legislature later in the week and be signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Thousands of Wisconsin union workers have rallied at the state Capitol to protest a right-to-work bill set to be taken up again this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Assembly Labor Committee, six days after the Senate Labor Committee held a similar hearing, heard testimony into the night on the bill that would ban any requirement that nonunion members in the private sector pay union dues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Opponents outnumbered supporters 70-1 at last week's Senate hearing, and the majority of those speaking Monday were also against the measure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The committee only took testimony and did not plan a vote on the measure, which was identical to what the full Senate passed last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Democrats called on the committee to make changes, but Republican committee chairman Rep.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Andre Jacque, R-DePere, said that would only delay the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Democrats can offer amendments when the measure is up before the full Republican-controlled Assembly, likely on Thursday, but none are expected to be adopted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Unlike in the Senate, where the committee was cut short before hundreds of people were able to testify, everyone who had registered to speak Monday and was present was able to say their piece.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Union members and other opponents reiterated their arguments that the measure would weaken unions, leading to lower wages and unsafe workplaces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>They also questioned who really wanted the law, given that coalitions representing hundreds of contractors and other businesses had formed in opposition, and said it was wrong to rush the bill through in less than two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Supporters, including the state chamber of commerce, said they represented many other people who were reluctant to speak publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Backers argue that the change will make Wisconsin more competitive with other states, in particular Indiana and Michigan, and allow workers the freedom to decide whether they want to pay union dues rather than have them deducted automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Scott Manley, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, said businesses are pushing for the bill because it will send a message that the state has a more favorable climate for development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Kristi LaCroix, a former teacher from Kenosha, testified in favor of the measure saying workers should have the option to pay dues, rather than being required to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>John Drew, a United Auto Workers representative from Milwaukee, said approving the bill would allow non-union employees to become freeloaders, as they would receive union benefits without paying dues.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"It's like saying if you don't like the Republicans controlling Wisconsin, you shouldn't have to pay taxes," Drew said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Randy Bryce, a former Democratic state Senate candidate and member of the Ironworkers Local 8 union who was removed from the Senate gallery last week for yelling during debate, called the bill a "blatant political attack" and government intrusion into private business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Madison bankruptcy attorney James Murray sarcastically testified in favor of the bill, saying it would "send a clear message that Wisconsin is open for bankruptcy."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The full Assembly, which is controlled by Republicans 63-36, was expected to debate the measure Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The bill passed the Senate on a 17-15 vote last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Walker, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, has said he will sign it into law by the end of the week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The bill would take effect immediately.</td></tr>
