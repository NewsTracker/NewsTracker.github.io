<h3>Kerry to meet Russian foreign minister for talks on Ukraine, Syria and Yemen</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Sochi on Tuesday for talks about the ongoing unrest in Ukraine, Syria and Yemen, Russian news agencies have reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>State news agency RIA-Novosti cited a diplomatic source as saying the Kremlin hopes Kerry will bring new proposals on reaching a settlement in Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>There was no immediate confirmation from the US state department on the trip, although Kerry has made it clear for several months that he would like to go to Russia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The last time he visited the country was in May 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Sporadic conflict has continued in Ukraine despite a ceasefire agreement signed in mid-February.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Western countries have accused Russia of supporting separatist rebels in Ukraine with arms and manpower - a claim that Moscow has denied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Russia has bristled at recent efforts by Washington to provide training for Ukrainian troops, calling it a destabilising policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Russia's Interfax news agency cited an unnamed official as saying the issue of US military assistance to Ukraine would be raised at the meeting in Sochi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>During a visit to Moscow on Sunday, German chancellor Angela Merkel urged Russia to use its influence to persuade separatists in Ukraine to abide by the oft-violated ceasefire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ukraine says more than 8,000 people have died in the conflict, which began in April 2014 and involves government forces and Russian-backed separatistss.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>Russia last month announced it would lift a five-year ban on delivery of the S-300 air defence missile system to Iran, drawing a hasty rebuke from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The White House said the missile system would give the Islamic republic's military a strong deterrent against any air attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Kremlin argues that the S-300 is a purely defensive system that will not jeopardise the security of Israel or any other countries of the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>On Syria, Russia has defied a chorus of international condemnation to remain committed to the embattled regime of President Bashar al-Assad.</td></tr>
