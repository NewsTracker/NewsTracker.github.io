<h3>Syrian Kurds battle Islamic State in northeast</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Ten members of the Kurdish YPG militia were also killed in the fighting in Hasaka province, a strategically important region that borders Turkey and Iraq and where Islamic State has recently lost ground, said Nasir Haj Mahmoud, a Kurdish official, speaking by phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Daesh is trying to open new front," Mahmoud said, using an Arabic term for Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said the death toll among Islamic State fighters was as high as 41, and the dead included foreign fighters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The latest battle between the enemies began when Islamic State fighters launched an attack between the towns of Tel Tamr and Tel Hamis, which the Kurdish militia seized from Islamic State in February, Mahmoud said.</td></tr>
