<h3>Official: Mexico arrests Zetas leader Omar Trevino Morales</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name due to government policy, said Trevino Morales was arrested in a pre-dawn raid in San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy suburb of the northern city of Monterrey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Mexican government had offered a 30-million peso ($2 million) reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had offered a $5 million reward for his capture, saying he was wanted on drug-trafficking charges, but listed "Omar" as an alias and his given name as Alejandro.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano "El Lazca."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The Zetas carved a path of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Much of the violence along Mexico's northeast border, however, is now due to internal battles among factions of the Gulf cartel.</td></tr>
