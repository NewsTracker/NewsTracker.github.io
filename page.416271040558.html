<h3>LA Unified asks Apple to end delivery of Pearson products</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The Los Angeles Unified School District is telling Apple it's dissatisfied with the Pearson Education curriculum for student iPads and wants reimbursement for all the learning materials schools haven't been able to use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a letter Monday, the district said it won't accept or compensate Apple for new deliveries of Pearson's English and math software.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The letter says state-of-the-art technology was promised but most students still can't access the software.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>It's the latest controversy over a now-abandoned $1.3 billion plan to provide iPads for every student.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple's contract with Pearson added about $200 to the cost of each device.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Pearson says there were challenges in implementing new technologies with the district but the company stands by the quality of its performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A message seeking comment from Apple wasn't immediately returned.</td></tr>
