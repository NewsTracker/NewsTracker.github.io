<h3>Microsoft to ax Internet Explorer brand</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SEATTLE, March 17 (UPI) -- Microsoft is putting Internet Explorer browser to rest and releasing a new browser under another name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"We're now researching what the new brand, or the new name, for our browser should be in Windows 10," Microsoft's marketing chief Chris Capossela said at the Microsoft Convergence Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We'll continue to have Internet Explorer, but we'll also have a new browser called Project Spartan, which is codenamed Project Spartan. We have to name the thing."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Microsoft has tried multiple times to reshape the image of the browser that has been edged out by Chrome, Firefox and other browsers but failed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Microsoft is making compelling software right now, software as good as Google and Apple. But they still have a perception of lagging and they are trying to break that perception and that includes retiring brands," said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis.</td></tr>
