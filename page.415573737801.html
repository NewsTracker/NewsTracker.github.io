<h3>Ukraine urges EU to keep up sanctions pressure on Russia</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>EU President Donald Tusk said the decision reached at a two-day summit showed the common resolve of the 28 EU nations in the face of Russian involvement in the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>It also underscored the support of the EU for Ukraine, which had urged the member nations to keep up pressure on Russia until it meets all its obligations under a deal brokered in the Belarus capital of Minsk last month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"We have to maintain our sanctions until the Minsk agreement is fully implemented," Tusk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Russia has denied any military involvement in the fighting in eastern Ukraine and calls EU and U.S. sanctions unjustified.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk met Thursday with Tusk ahead of the summit and accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of trying to divide Europe over Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>He told Tusk that a European show of unity would be "the best answer."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the decision showed that "the EU summit is united."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The Minsk agreement must be executed by all parties fully and within deadline," he told reporters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"The option of more sanctions, if the situation worsens, must clearly remain open."</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The European leaders did not impose any new sanctions, in part because a ceasefire called for in the Minsk agreement is largely holding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>More than 6,000 people have been killed in the year-long conflict between the Ukrainian army and Russia-backed separatists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The EU has visa bans and asset freezes in place targeting 150 individuals, including high-ranking Russians, and 37 entities such as banks, companies and rebel groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>It also has economic sanctions in place that have hit Russian financial and energy interests " as does the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The sanctions expire later this year, but the leaders can extend them when they next meet in Brussels in June.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Yatsenyuk also expressed optimism about European backing for his government's call to the U.N. for international peacekeepers to be sent to eastern Ukraine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>It was not immediately clear whether the EU approved such a force Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Everyone wants to get peace in Europe. One of the tools to reach this peace is to deploy peacekeepers," Yatsenyuk said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Also Thursday, an influential European Parliament committee voted in favor of a plan to provide Ukraine with 1.8 billion euros ($1.92 billion) in medium-term loans to help lift the country out of recession.</td></tr>
