<h3>Islamic State affiliate threatens to kill Croatian man kidnapped in Egypt</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>An Islamic State affiliate in Egypt has threatened to kill a Croatian man kidnapped in Cairo last month within 48 hours if "Muslim women" jailed in Egypt are not freed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>In a video posted online by the jihadis, the hostage identifies himself as Tomislav Salopek, working for a French company, and appears kneeling at the feet of a hooded man holding a knife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Reading from a sheet of paper, he says he will be killed within 48 hours if Egypt's government fails to release Muslim women held in prisons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Salopek, wearing an orange jumpsuit, did not say when the countdown began.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He said he works for French geoscience company CGG's branch office in Cairo and that he was abducted on 22 July by the Sinai Province group, Isis's Egyptian affiliate based in the Sinai peninsula.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Formerly known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, the group changed its name when it pledged allegiance to Isis in November.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Two days after the kidnapping, the Croatian foreign ministry said in a statement that Salopek was abducted as he travelled to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Salopek is the first foreigner to be abducted and threatened with death by militants in Egypt since the Islamist insurgency broke out after the army's ousting of president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>In December, the Sinai Province claimed responsibility for the killing last August of an American working for petroleum company Apache.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, was overthrown by then army chief, and now president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi after mass street protests against his divisive single year in office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The authorities subsequently launched a sweeping crackdown targeting Morsi's supporters in which hundreds of people were killed and thousands jailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Hundreds more were sentenced to death after speedy trials, denounced by the UN as "unprecedented in recent history".</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>In retaliation, militants have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, mostly in the Sinai peninsula, where the Sinai Province group jihadis are waging a campaign against the security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The group has also staged attacks in other cities, including the capital Cairo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>In July, Isis said it was behind a car bomb attack targeting the Italian consulate in downtown Cairo - the first such attack against a foreign mission in Egypt since jihadis began their campaign following the crackdown on Islamists.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>In February, Isis released a video showing the beheadings of 21 Coptic Christians, all but one of them Egyptians, on a beach in neighbouring Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The mass murder of the Egyptian Christians prompted air strikes by Cairo targeting Isis inside Libya.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The threat to kill Salopek comes ahead of Thursday's inauguration of the "new Suez Canal" waterway in the port city of Ismailia, with hundreds of foreign dignitaries including French president Francois Hollande due to attend.</td></tr>
