<tr><td>3</td><td>WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate Republican leaders announced plans Friday to use a must-pass highway bill to try to overturn President Barack Obama's health care law, in the latest GOP assault on "Obamacare."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor "nearly every Republican wants" a full repeal of the law, and he introduced an amendment to the highway bill to do just that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A vote was set for Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The move was met with immediate derision from Democrats in the wake of last month's Supreme Court ruling upholding central elements of the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"Again, the majority leader has cynically filed another repeal of Obama health care legislation," Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"I hope the Senate doesn't try to catch up with the House as to how many times they're going to try to repeal that."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Even with the Senate under Republican control McConnell's amendment is unlikely to reach the 60-vote threshold needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Republicans control 54 seats in the Senate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>And any such legislation would be sure to be vetoed by Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The House has voted more than 50 times to repeal the health law in full or in part.</td></tr>
