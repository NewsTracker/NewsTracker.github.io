<h3>At NH summit, GOP 2016 hopefuls take turns attacking Clinton ahead of her arrival - GOP hopefuls try to woo voters with policy, humor</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>GOP presidential hopefuls turned up their attacks Saturday on Hillary Clinton -- taking turns piling on the 2016 Democratic presidential frontrunner during a party summit in New Hampshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The first five 2016 GOP presidential candidates or potential candidates used at least some of their stage time at the Republican Leadership Summit, in Nashua, N.H., to criticize Clinton, who is scheduled to be in the state Monday and Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>I?m starting to worry that when Clinton travels she'll need two planes -- one for her and her entourage and one for her baggage,?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>said Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, particularly critical of Clinton?s tenure as secretary of state in which four Americans were killed in Benghazi, Libya, and she used a private server and email address for official business.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>When I think of scandals, the one that bothers me the most is Benghazi,?</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>he continued.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>?What I fault Hillary most for is for nine months (Americans in Benghazi) pleaded for help.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Nearly 20 Republican White House prospects were on the program for the weekend conference that ended Saturday afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Paul was followed by former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, the only high-profile, potential 2016 GOP White House female candidate so far this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Hillary Clinton must not be president of the United States,?</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>said Fiorina, who repeated her criticism that Clinton?s extensive travelogue as the country?s top diplomat is not a marker of success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal began his remarks by pretending to have mistakenly read a Clinton stump speech, saying he wanted to talk about President Obama?s ?great success?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>in the Middle East.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>I?m sorry, this is Hillary Clinton?s speech, not my speech,?</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Jindal said to laughter and applause.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>He later said: ?We can win, we must win, we will win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>It is critical we beat Hillary Clinton.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>N.Y. real estate mogul Donald Trump was perhaps the easiest on Clinton, suggesting she was not invincible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I know Hillary very well,?</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>?I can beat her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>And I think most people cannot.?</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsay Graham was critical of Clinton?s now 8-day-old campaign in which her interactions with people in Iowa, and those she met along the way in her van, appear to be carefully managed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Hillary Clinton couldn't be here today because we didn't ask her,?</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>said Graham, also critical of Clinton before, during and after the Benghazi attacks.</td></tr>
