<h3>Baltimore officers charged in death of Freddie Gray indicted by grand jury</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>BALTIMORE - All six officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray, an African-American who died while in Baltimore police custody, were indicted by a grand jury, a prosecutor said Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The indictments were very similar to the charges Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced about three weeks ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The most serious charge for each officer, ranging from second-degree "depraved heart" murder to assault, still stood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Grey suffered a critical spinal injury after police handcuffed, shackled and placed him head-first into a van, Mosby has said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>His pleas for medical attention were repeatedly ignored, she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Mosby said prosecutors had presented evidence to the grand jury for the past two weeks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Some of the charges were changed based on new information, but she didn't say what that new information was.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>She also did not take questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"As is often the case, during an ongoing investigation, charges can and should be revised based upon the evidence," Mosby said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>In all, three of the officers had additional charges brought against them while three others had one less charge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Grey was arrested April 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>He died in a hospital a week later and became a symbol of what protesters say was police brutality against blacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>None of the officers secured Gray's seatbelt in the van, a violation of police policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Soon after he was placed in the van, Goodson stopped to secure him with leg irons because he had become "irate," police said.</td></tr>
