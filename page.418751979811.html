<h3>Bill Clinton: Hillary once thought she was 'too aggressive'</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton once thought she was "too aggressive" to be a politician, according to her husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Early in their relationship, he encouraged her to move to a big city and run for office rather than marry him, former President Bill Clinton told Time Magazine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"I asked her to marry me three times before she said yes... and the first time I said, 'I want you to marry me but you shouldn't do it,'" he said before encouraging her to move to New York City or Chicago and run for office.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Hillary Clinton's reply showed her lack of confidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Oh my God | I'll never run for office. I'm too aggressive, and nobody will ever vote for me," she said, according to her now-husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The former President says he's keeping a low profile around Hillary's campaign these days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>President George W. Bush, in the joint interview, said he encouraged his brother to run because the likelihood of Hillary as the nominee meant the problem of a dynastic candidate wasn't as problematic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"What difference does it make," he said at the time, "if the order is Bush/Clinton/Bush/Obama/Clinton or it is Bush/Clinton/Bush/Obama/Bush?"</td></tr>
