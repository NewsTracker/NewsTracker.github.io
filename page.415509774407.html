<h3>Kurds report more chlorine attacks by Islamic State as Iraq pauses Tikrit offensive</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>General Aziz Waisi told journalists the insurgents used chlorine twice during a January offensive west of Mosul and once in a December attack on his military police brigade in the Sinjar mountain area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>One attack near Mosul, on January 23, was described by Kurdish authorities on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Dutch-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said over the weekend it had not had a request from Iraq to investigate claims of chemical weapons use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Iraq's Kurds were the victims of the deadliest chemical attack of modern times when Saddam Hussein's air force bombed the town of Halabja in 1988, killing at least 5,000 people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In Tikrit, military officials said there was no fighting on Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) insurgents controlling large parts of north and west Iraq and territory in neighbouring Syria have held onto central districts of Saddam's home city and have laid explosives to hold up the advancing forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The offensive by Iraqi security forces and mainly Shia militia, who entered Tikrit last week, is their largest yet against Isil, but it stalled on Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Government forces control of most of the northern Qadisiya district as well as the southern and western outskirts of the city, trapping the militants in an area bounded by a river along Tikrit's eastern edge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"We need air support from any force that can work with us against Isil," Ibrahim al-Lami, deputy defence minister, told Reuters, declining to say whether he meant from the US-led coalition or Iran, which is playing a role in the assault.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Pentagon said it did not view the offensive in Tikrit as stalled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"Offensive operations like this have a rhythm to them," said Army Colonel Steve Warren, Pentagon spokesman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Gen Warren said the US-led coalition helping Iraq had not conducted any strikes in support of operations in Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Powerful militia commander Hadi al-Amiri, head of the Shia paramilitary Badr Organisation, said earlier in the offensive that militia victories before the Tikrit battle had been won without coalition air support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Mohammed al-Ghaban, interior minister, said authorities had temporarily halted the offensive in Tikrit "to reduce casualties among our heroic forces... and to preserve the remaining infrastructure".</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>"We will choose the appropriate time to attack the enemy and liberate the area," he told journalists in Samarra, 60 miles north of Baghdad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>More than 20,000 troops and Iranian-backed Shia militia are taking part in the operation, which began two weeks ago, supported by a relatively small contingent of Sunni fighters from Tikrit and the surrounding Salahuddin province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The assault is seen as a litmus test for plans to retake the large northern city of Mosul, which is likely to be a far more complex operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Meanwhile, coalition air strikes helped Kurdish forces seize Wahda, Saada, and Khalid villages from Isil in the north and drive militants away from the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Shia Turkmen fighters also clashed for a fourth day with Islamic State insurgents near Bashir village, south of Kirkuk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>In Baghdad, US presidential envoy General John Allen addressed a meeting of Iraqi and foreign officials aimed at kicking off efforts to stabilise and rebuild territories retaken from Islamic State.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The militants have been driven back by Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the north and Shia militia known as Hashid Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) in the eastern province of Diyala, the Baghdad belt and north of the capital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Allen said Iraqis were beginning to recover from life under Islamic State in Diyala and "hopefully soon" in Tikrit, local governance would prove difficult because many officials had been killed, were in exile or co-operated with Isil.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rafid al-Jaboori, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's spokesman, echoed calls for more air strikes: "We have been saying we need more air support for all operations," he told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>"We welcome air support for all our campaigns against Isil".</td></tr>

<h3>Police: Man admits to Ferguson shooting</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Two officers shot outside Ferguson police dept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>(CNN)Jeffrey Williams admitted he fired the shots that struck two officers in Ferguson, police said, but claimed he wasn't aiming for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Nonetheless, the 20-year-old from the St. Louis area has been arrested for the shootings of two police officers during last week's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Williams has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He described Williams as a frequent protester in the city -- which some took issue with.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Bishop Derrick Robinson, an area organizer, said he spoke to Williams on Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"I asked him why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad -- because so many things that we've done to rebuild our community," Robinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"It sets us like five steps back to say that it was a protester who did it, but he admitted to me that he'd never protested."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>For more than 200 days, protests have taken place in Ferguson since the August shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>At the time of his arrest, Williams was on probation for receiving stolen property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>He said police served a search warrant on Williams' residence where they seized a .40-caliber handgun, "which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered" at the scene of the shooting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Williams is being held on a cash-only $300,000 bond, McCulloch said, adding that it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Investigators are not sure they "buy" Williams' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals, McCulloch said, but he didn't rule it out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"It's possible he was firing at someone else," he said, urging any other witnesses with information to come forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Officers saw "muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away," Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>"We could have buried two police officers," Belmar told reporters last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>"I feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was."</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Authorities offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers, according to the St. Louis Regional CrimeStoppers website.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting, and that the shots came from a grassy hill away from the crowd.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"In no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting," said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The department has been criticized since the shooting death of Brown and, more recently, since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination in the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>"We are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment. We support peaceful protesting. However, we will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts," the mayor of Ferguson and the City Council said in a statement Sunday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>While many protesters have decried the Ferguson Police Department, neither of the officers shot last week were from the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>One is from Webster Groves, a St. Louis suburb 13 miles south of Ferguson.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police Department, who has been in law enforcement for 14 years.</td></tr>
