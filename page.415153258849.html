<h3>Kurt Busch to follow guidelines toward NASCAR reinstatement</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The 2004 champion was indefinitely suspended Feb. 20 after a Delaware judge said he believed Busch likely committed an act of domestic violence against a former girlfriend and there was a "substantial likelihood" of him doing it again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Busch lost two rounds of appeals for reinstatement before the season-opening Daytona 500 and has missed the first two races of the season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Regan Smith has replaced him in the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>41 Chevrolet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>On Monday, NASCAR spokesman David Higdon said Busch has "agreed to our terms and conditions that must be met before he is eligible for consideration for reinstatement of his NASCAR license."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Stewart-Haas Racing, which on Monday said Smith would again drive the No.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>41 this weekend at Las Vegas, said there is no timetable for Busch to meet NASCAR's guidelines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"Kurt's willingness to embrace the conditions set forth by NASCAR is a positive step that we support," SHR said in a statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The specific guidelines have not been disclosed, but Higdon said an unidentified NASCAR consultant helped create them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Higdon added that Busch would need to meet the requirements "to the satisfaction of both NASCAR and the expert.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>"The expert administering the reinstatement can come back with a recommendation of return, but Kurt still must satisfy NASCAR's expectations, as well," he said.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>AJ Allmendinger, for example, had to complete a program overseen by Dr. David Black, who runs NASCAR's drug-testing unit.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>Jeremy Clements, who was suspended in 2013 for an inappropriate comment, was reinstated after completing a NASCAR-authorized sensitivity training program.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The program was administered by sports sociologist Richard Lapchick and his staff at the University of Central Florida's Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Higdon said a domestic violence expert will oversee Busch's program, and NASCAR will not be part of the process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Unrelated to the guidelines for NASCAR reinstatement are conditions placed on Busch by Family Court Commissioner David Jones, who granted a no-contact order for ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Jones wrote in his opinion that he believe believes there's real possibility Busch will lash out again and has a propensity to lose control in response to disappointing or frustrating situations involving racing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Jones ordered Busch to be evaluated to see if there is a "treatable mental health condition."</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He also said Busch must follow any suggested treatment plans.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Busch is appealing Jones' ruling.</td></tr>
