<h3>Jilted groom John Whitbread jets off with stranger after auctioning off place on honeymoon</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>John Whitbread, 32, from Donisthorpe, Leicestershire, was heartbroken after his ex-fiancee Amy told him she wasn't 'ready to get married' and left him with a spare ticket to the Dominican Republic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Instead of cancelling the trip, Mr Whitbread decided to give the opportunity to a stranger to join him by auctioning off the 1,950 ticket, with offers starting at 99p.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>But when the two highest bidders - who offered 8,000 and 7,900 - failed to pay up he decided to raffle off the tickets for 10 instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He was united with raffle winner Kelly Wood for the first time on ITV this morning just under two hours before he was due to board the plane at Manchester airport for the two-week all inclusive break.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The advert said his desired companion must be an 'easy going down to earth' woman, a British citizen with a passport and 'good looking wouldn't go amiss'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Arriving at the airport with his parents this morning, Mr Whitbread waited anxiously to see if the woman would arrive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He said: 'I feel nervous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>I don't know what to do with myself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mr Whitbread was undecided on how he would greet her and was debating whether to give her a hug, a kiss - or 'a high five' and added 'I'll see what comes naturally'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>When they were finally introduced by a television crew they gave each other a hug.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Miss Wood, who had set up her own Facebook campaign called 'Take Kelly Wood' said: 'I'm nervous - my hands have just started to shake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A television crew from Good Morning Britain, which filmed the moment they first met, asked the pair a few 'Mr & Mrs' style questions before they boarded the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Asked who would get the window seat Miss Wood offered it up to Mr Whitbread and whether they were thrill seekers or beach babes they agreed they were a bit of both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Miss Wood also revealed that she 'sleeps in the middle of the bed' and the worst habit Mr Whitbread could have would be snoring, which he previously revealed he did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>His new companion was then introduced to Mr Whitbread's parents, who embraced her and their son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The pair will fly to the Caribbean region today, where they will stay in the honeymoon suite in single beds, and return on March 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Instead of cancelling the honeymoon he decided to auction off the tickets to a stranger who might like to join him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Explaining his decision to sell-off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said: 'I was gutted when she said she didn't want to get married but I realised I couldn't mope forever and I didn't want what I'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>He claims his girlfriend of two years, Amy, told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on Valentine's Day this year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But when he tried to cancel their holiday the Co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>With the help of his best friend Craig Gibson, he set up an eBay auction to find someone to travel with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Mr Whitbread, who described himself as a slim, 5'9, with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh, wrote on the advert: 'I'm not boring, I'm adventurous otherwise I wouldn't be doing something as ridiculous as this'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>This is the moment the pair first met live on breakfast television this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Before then all they knew were each others names and what they looked like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Kelly Wood had campaigned to win the ticket and was introduced to her holiday partner for the first time this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry on Valentine's Day, Mr Whitbread says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Speaking after the split, he said: 'I'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - I suppose I've got to respect her honesty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>'But I'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>'When I found out at the travel agent I could only get half my money back I was looking at other deals and places I could go but I thought, "No, I wanted to go on this holiday".</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>'I called my best friend and he agreed so I headed straight to his house to make the ebay page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>'Everyone I know is taken and I'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that I'd never otherwise get to meet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>'I'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>'I'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>After being overwhelmed with the response, Mr Whitbread pledged to donate any money over 1,050 to testicular cancer research, and so far the figure has reached 2,000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Kelly Wood set up her own Facebook page to get people to buy tickets and donate to Mr Whitbread's cause and eventually won the seat herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>His ex-girlfriend Amy said: 'I just didn't feel ready to get married and John wasn't my soulmate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Obviously it's difficult for John, I'm finding it hard too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>'It's obviously not nice to finish with someone over Christmas but I thought it was better that he knew now, sooner rather than later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>'It was better that I called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>'Fair play to John.</td></tr>

<h3>Battle persists for Ukraine railway hub Debaltseve</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>LUHANSKE, Ukraine -- Intense artillery exchanges between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists persisted Monday around a strategic town in eastern Ukraine -- fighting that threatens to dash a cease-fire deal brokered by European leaders last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Under the cease-fire agreement negotiated by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, the warring sides are to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>That plan already looks at risk, with the rebels saying they are not satisfied that conditions are in place for the process to go ahead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Associated Press reporters in Luhanske, a government-held town 15 kilometres northwest of the bitterly contested railway hub of Debaltseve, heard sustained shelling Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Some of the artillery appeared to be outgoing, suggesting it was being fired by Ukrainian troops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Debaltseve, still in government hands, remains in contention despite the cease-fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The rebels insist the town should revert to their control because they have encircled it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>A loaded Grad rocket launcher was seen pointing in the direction of Debaltseve, but it was not fired while AP journalists were present.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Speaking by telephone Monday night, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko expressed concerns about the continued fighting at Debaltseve and "also expressed the wish that the OSCE observers have a free access to continue their work on the ground," an official in Hollande's entourage said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The official spoke anonymously because they were not allowed to speak publicly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Observers from the Organization from Security and Cooperation in Europe, who are supposed to monitor the cease-fire, said Sunday that separatists denied them access to Debaltseve.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement Monday afternoon that the U.S. was concerned about continued fighting in Debaltseve and statements by the separatists that they refuse to observe the cease-fire there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Despite the cease-fire that went into effect early Sunday morning, five Ukrainian troops were killed and 25 were wounded in the past 24 hours, Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Monday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Separatist military official Eduard Basurin said in a televised news conference Monday that the government overnight lobbed artillery at Horlivka, a town under rebel control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ukraine, however, blamed that attack on the rebels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The government-appointed police chief of the Donetsk region, Vyacheslav Abroskin, said the separatists shelled the town in order to derail the truce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The cease-fire appeared to hold elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The city hall of the rebel capital Donetsk, which came under heavy artillery fire in the past week, said on Monday that there was no fighting in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of arming and supplying manpower to the separatists and have imposed a range of economic sanctions to pressure Moscow into changing its course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Russia denies all suggestions it is directly involved in the war in Ukraine, but the sheer amount of heavy weapons the rebels have belies that claim.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>The cease-fire had raised cautious hopes for an end to the 10-month-old conflict, which has already claimed more than 5,300 lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>But Ukraine and rebel officials have already traded multiple accusations of attacks since then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Both the separatists and the Ukrainian government insist they are committed to the cease-fire negotiated in marathon talks last week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>But the Russian news agency Interfax quoted Basurin as saying Monday that conditions are not yet ready to pull back heavy weapons on Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>"We will begin pulling back equipment from the line of contact if we receive a certain signal, which is if the Ukrainians also do the same thing," Basurin was quoted as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>In Berlin, Merkel appealed for the cease-fire to be respected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"The situation is fragile," she conceded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"(But) that was certainly to be expected with a view to Debaltseve."</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli mentioned the possibility of a meeting between the German, French, Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers this week to discuss "further steps" to implement the cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>President Vladimir Putin's aide Yuri Ushakov told Russian news agencies that the cease-fire is "changing the situation dramatically" and that Moscow looks forward to the heavy weaponry being pulled out from the front line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>On Monday, the European Union added 19 more people and nine organizations to its list of sanctioned Russian entities, including two Russian deputy defence ministers, the eastern Ukraine-born Russian crooner Iosif Kobzon, who sang to the rebel leaders in Donetsk last year, and several separatist commanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted angrily to the decision, calling it "clumsy" in the context of last week's cease-fire deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>The ministry dismissed the new EU sanctions as "running against common sense" and harming chances "to resolve an internal Ukrainian conflict."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Ukrainian soldier on the road between the towns of Debaltseve and Artemivsk, Ukraine, on Feb. 16, 2015.</td></tr>
