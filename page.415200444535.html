<h3>Ben Carson: Being Gay Is 'Absolutely' A Choice</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>In an interview with CNN, Carson argued prisons prove people choose to be gay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"Because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight -- and when they come out, they're gay," Carson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question."</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The American Psychological Association says says "there is no consensus among scientists" on how a person's sexual orientation is developed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors," the APA says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Carson suggested in a 2013 Fox News interview that legalizing gay marriage would pave the way for legal bestiality and pedophilia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He later apologized for the remark, but argued it "was taken completely out of context and completely misunderstood."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"As a Christian, I have a duty to love all people and that includes people who have other sexual orientations, and I certainly do, and never had any intention of offending If anyone was offended, I apologize to you," Carson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>According to the Human Rights Campaign, other potential GOP candidates have weighed in on LGBT issues, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who said he thinks being gay is a personal choice, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who said engaging in "homosexual conduct is a choice."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Fred Sainz, HRC Vice President of Communications, questioned Carson's comments in a statement Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The only thing that's really been proven here is that when Ben Carson says what he really thinks, he reveals himself as utterly unfit for office," Sainz said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"Ben Carson is putting his own personal ambition ahead of medical science by suggesting that a person can change their sexual orientation. As a doctor, Carson surely knows that countless mental health and medical organizations have condemned the idea that you can change a person's sexual orientation."</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Watch Carson's remarks above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>This post has been updated with information on other Republicans' views on LGBT issues and a statement from the Human Rights Campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>What Would Cause Ben Carson to NOT Run for President?</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Could Jeb Bush wind up supporting gay marriage?</td></tr>

<h3>Mexico Captures Zetas Cartel Leader Omar Trevino Morales: Official</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A simultaneous raid on another street in the same suburb reaped Carlos Arturo Jimenez Encinas, allegedly Trevino's finance chief, Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Tomas Zeron, the attorney general's criminal investigations chief, called Trevino "one of the most dangerous and bloodthirsty criminals in Mexico" and said he faced at least 11 criminal counts including drug trafficking, organized crime, kidnapping and oil theft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He also said Trevino faced a pending extradition request from the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The Mexican government had offered a 30 million peso ($2 million) reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration offered a $5 million reward for his capture, saying he was wanted for drug trafficking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said in a statement, "The Zetas represent the worst in global organized crime: violence, intimidation, corruption, and brutal killings. Today's arrest strikes at the heart of the leadership structure of the Zetas and should serve as yet another warning that no criminal is immune from arrest and prosecution."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after Mexican marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano "El Lazca."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rubido said Omar, 38, took over leadership of the Zetas after his brother's arrest and immediately became a target of their investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The hunt for him caught a break in February when authorities observed someone matching Trevino's description at one of the houses around Monterrey where Jimenez Encinas, the alleged finance chief, was known to hold meetings, Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Surveillance was increased until Trevino's identity was confirmed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Authorities discovered he was moving with a smaller than usual security detail to draw less attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Just after 3 a.m. Wednesday, federal police and soldiers moved on both locations, Rubido said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Four additional men were also arrested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>All six were walked across the tarmac from a military plane at Mexico City's airport and loaded into armored personnel carriers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The Zetas was originally a gang formed by deserters from an elite army unit and left a trail of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>But much of the violence along Mexico's northeast border now is due to internal battles among Gulf cartel factions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>"The truth is that this is a group that has been fragmented," Javier Oliva, an expert on the drug war at Mexico's National Autonomous University, said of the Zetas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>"Their influence is now more on a local level, in townships" rather than the broad, multi-state trafficking corridor they once controlled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>But Oliva said that doesn't mean the Zetas and their internal fight to determine a replacement for Trevino Morales won't turn bloody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>He said gunmen or second-tier operators who were active under Trevino Morales may now seek to replace him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"One would hope that the federal and state governments have taken precautions to avoid this arrest from causing more violence," Oliva said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>The capture of Omar Trevino Morales follows Friday's arrest of another big cartel leader, Servando Gomez, known as "La Tuta."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Gomez allegedly led the Knights Templar, a pseudo-religious drug gang that built up control of many sectors of the economy in the western state of Michoacan before it was weakened by an uprising of citizen vigilante groups and a stepped-up federal security campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The two arrests provided much-needed good news for the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has been battered by a series of scandals in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>"The government needed to show that some of its policies were successful," said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>"And in this case, without doubt the strategy against the drug cartels is going well."</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Like Servando Gomez, Omar Trevino Morales was captured without any shots being fired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>The Trevino Morales brothers took proceeds from their U.S. drug sales and laundered them by purchasing American quarter horses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>That scheme was led by Jose Trevino Morales, a third brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>A jury in Texas found Morales guilty in May of investing $16 million of drug money in the buying, training and racing of horses across the Southwest United States.</td></tr>
