<h3>Saddam's tomb suffers extensive damage in fighting as Iraqi security forces battle for Tikrit</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>OUJA, Iraq - The tomb of Iraq's late dictator Saddam Hussein was virtually leveled in heavy clashes between militants from the Islamic State group and Iraqi forces in a fight for control of the city of Tikrit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fighting intensified to the north and south of Saddam Hussein's hometown Sunday as Iraqi security forces vowed to reach the center of Tikrit within 48 hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Associated Press video from the village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, shows all that remains of Hussein's once-lavish tomb are the support columns that held up the roof.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Poster-sized pictures of Saddam, which once covered the mausoleum, are now nowhere to be seen amid the mountains of concrete rubble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead, Shiite militia flags and photos of militia leaders mark the predominantly Sunni village, including that of Maj.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the powerful Iranian general advising Iraqi Shiite militias on the battlefield.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"This is one of the areas where IS militants massed the most because Saddam's grave is here," said Captain Yasser Nu'ma, an official with the Shiite militias, formerly known as the Popular Mobilization Forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"The IS militants' set an ambush for us by planting bombs around" the tomb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The extremist Islamic State group has controlled Tikrit since June, when it waged its lightning offensive that saw Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, come under their control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The Islamic State was helped in its conquest of northern Iraq by Saddam loyalists, including military veterans, who appealed to Sunnis who felt victimized by Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The Islamic State group claimed in August that Saddam's tomb had been completely destroyed, but local officials said it was just ransacked and burned, but suffered only minor damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Saddam was captured by U.S. forces in 2003 and was executed by hanging in December 2006 after an Iraqi special tribunal found him guilty of crimes against humanity for the mass killing of Shiites and Kurds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>His body has been kept in the mausoleum in his birthplace, Ouja, since 2007.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The complex featured a marble octagon at the center of which a bed of fresh flowers covered the place where his body was buried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The extravagant chandelier at its center was reminiscent of the extravagant life he led until U.S. forces toppled him in 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Iraqi media reported last year that Saddam's body was removed by loyalists amid fears that it would be disturbed in the fighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The body's location is not known.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Recapturing Tikrit, a Sunni bastion on the Tigris River, would pave the way for an assault on Mosul, which U.S. officials have said could come as soon as next month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Concerns are mounting that Iraq's Shiite militias, of which an estimated 20,000 are fighting in Tikrit, will carry out revenge attacks on this and other areas that are home to predominantly Sunni residents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Amnesty International last year said the militias wear military uniforms but operate outside any legal framework and without any official oversight, adding that they are not prosecuted for their crimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch echoed those concerns, calling on the Iraqi government to protect civilians in Tikrit and allow them to flee combat zones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Its statement noted "numerous atrocities" against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Shiite militants are increasingly being accused of leveling the Sunni towns they capture from the Islamic State group, making it impossible for residents to return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Tikrit has already been heavily damaged in months of violence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>A satellite image of Tikrit, released last month by the United Nations, observed that at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting, with at least 137 completely destroyed and 241 severely damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Local Sunni tribal fighters have formed uneasy alliances with the Iraqi army and Shiite militias in the battle for Tikrit, which Iraqi and U.S. officials believe is essential for defeating the Sunni militant group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Yazan al-Jubouri, a Sunni from Tikrit fighting alongside the Shiite militias, said that the Islamic State militants killed 16 of his relatives and kept his family living in horror.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"We want to take revenge on those IS militants who killed our children," he said.</td></tr>

<h3>West hopes for Iran concessions in nuclear talks</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had been due to meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, later on Sunday to try to break the logjam ahead of a crucial round of talks between Iran and six major powers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>But a senior U.S. State Department official later said that meeting would be delayed until Monday due to extensive U.S.-Iranian consultations earlier on Sunday between nuclear and Foreign Ministry officials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Kerry has urged Iran to take decisions now to enable them to clinch a political framework agreement for a nuclear deal with Tehran that would lift sanctions in exchange for curbs on Tehran's nuclear program ahead of an end-March deadline.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The parties have set a June 30 deadline to finalize an accord.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Serious gaps still remain," Deputy Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi was quoted by Iran's ISNA student news agency as saying.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"We have had progress in the recent talks and during this round of talks we will see whether more progress can be achieved."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"We hope to narrow the gaps on important disputes," he added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Kerry told CBS news on Saturday he hoped "in the next days" it would be possible to reach an interim political deal with Iran if Tehran can show that its nuclear power program is for peaceful purposes only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is not yet clear when the talks between Iran and the six powers will begin in Lausanne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Reuters reported last week that the United States and five other powers and Iran have begun talking about a possible draft resolution to endorse any future deal and address the lifting of U.N. sanctions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The U.N. penalties could be eased quickly in the event of an agreement, Western officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Officials close to the talks said this was a major new concession on the part of the United States, which had long insisted that U.N. sanctions would remain in place for years to come after a nuclear deal was signed, while unilateral U.S. and European measures might be lifted more swiftly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"This was a quite a shift in the U.S. position and we hope the Iranians will follow with concessions on their end," a Western official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>"So far the concessions have been mostly one-sided, though there has been some limited progress recently."</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Iranian officials have privately welcomed the new position on U.N. sanctions in the talks on the part of the United States and France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Diplomats say the other members of six power group back the idea of a swift suspension of U.N. nuclear sanctions if there is a deal, though they caution that many U.N. restrictions would stay in place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"Iran knows that it will not happen overnight, but the fact that it is being discussed at the (six powers') capitals and having a resolution is a sign of their willingness to resolve the issue," a senior Iranian official told Reuters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Iran, which rejects Western allegations it wants an atomic weapons capability, wants the U.N., EU and US sanctions lifted all at once.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>A nuclear accord that ends the decade-long standoff with Iran is seen as crucial to reducing tensions in the region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Officials on both sides of the talks said it will be very difficult to get a political agreement this week.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Iranian officials say that a signed agreement this week is unlikely, though they do not rule out some kind of verbal understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Some eight U.N. resolutions dating back as far as 2006, four of them imposing sanctions, demand that Iran freeze uranium enrichment and other sensitive atomic work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>They also bar the country from buying and selling atomic technology and anything linked to ballistic missiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>There is also a U.N. arms embargo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>In his CBS interview, Kerry also redoubled his criticism of Republicans, who said that seeking U.N. Security Council resolutions that endorse any deal and lift U.N. sanctions before seeking approval of Republican-led Congress would be wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>He said a letter from 47 Republicans to Iran's leadership warning that any deal with President Barack Obama bypassing the Senate would not be binding and could be rescinded later was an unprecedented intrusion on executive authority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Kerry voiced the hope that the letter would not undermine the negotiations in Lausanne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>The State Department said on Friday that any lifting of U.N. sanctions would not impact unilateral U.S. sanctions or limit Washington's ability to take action on its own against Iran in the future.</td></tr>
