<h3>Russell Brand skips SXSW premiere of 'raw' documentary on his life</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The comedian pulled out of attending the world premiere of 'Brand: A Second Coming,' directed by Ondi Timoner, and issued a statement instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The film features details about his relationships with women including his ex-wife Katy Perry and premiered at SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas on Friday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said in a statement: "I let go of my mad ambition to direct and star in what had become a shambles and handed the reins over to Ondi, who wanted creative control and to make a documentary about me and my transition from a relatively conventional celebrity to whatever the hell it is I am now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"Ondi is a very beautiful person and a director of peerless integrity, I suppose what I didn't consider was that in letting go of the film, I was agreeing to be the subject of a biography.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"You'd think a narcissist would like nothing more than talking about themselves and their 'rags to riches,' 'hard luck' story but actually, it felt like, to me, my life was hard enough the first time round and going through it again was painful and sad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"I know Ondi is an artist and I'm told the film is good but for me, watching it was very uncomfortable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Admitting Brand was unhappy with how "raw" the final version of the documentary is, Timoner confessed she was shocked by his reaction to the film.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>According to The Sun newspaper, she said: "I really wanted him to be at peace with this film, but I don't know if he'll ever really be at peace with it. It's so raw and so personal and he's never let anything like this out before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"I mean this is a guy who has written 'My Booky Wook' and makes a lot of his stand up about his personal life and his foibles and his history, but somehow, on film, it's a different story for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"He said to me a couple of times during filming, 'I went through it already. It was hard enough to live the first time."</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Brand -- who is now sober after struggling with drug and alcohol addiction in the past -- married 'Dark Horse' hitmaker Katy Perry in 2010 but they got divorced two years later.</td></tr>

<h3>3 deaths linked to Blue Bell ice cream prompts first recall</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Five people, in all, developed listeriosis in Kansas after eating products from one production line at the Blue Bell creamery in Brenham, Texas, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The FDA says listeria bacteria were found in samples of Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Country Cookies, Great Divide Bars, Sour Pop Green Apple Bars, Cotton Candy Bars, Scoops, Vanilla Stick Slices, Almond Bars and No Sugar Added Moo Bars.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Blue Bell says its regular Moo Bars were untainted, as were its half gallons, quarts, pints, cups, three-gallon ice cream and take-home frozen snack novelties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>There appeared to be some uncertainty as to where the patients acquired the listeria bacterial infection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement all five of the people sickened were receiving treatment for unrelated health issues at the same Kansas hospital before developing listeriosis, "a finding that strongly suggests their infections (with listeria bacteria) were acquired in the hospital."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The statement does not identify the hospital.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Of those five, information was available from four on what foods they had eaten in the month before the infection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>All four had consumed milkshakes made with a single-serving Blue Bell ice cream product called "Scoops: while they were in the hospital, the CDC said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"Scoops," as well as the other suspect Blue Bell items, are mostly food service items and not produced for retail, said Paul Cruse, CEO of the Brenham creamery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The CDC said the listeria isolated from specimens taken from four of the five patients at Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas, matched strains isolated from Blue Bell products obtained this year in South Carolina and Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The five patients became ill with listeriosis during their hospitalizations for unrelated causes between December 2013 and January 2015, said hospital spokeswoman Maria Loving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"Via Christi was not aware of any listeria contamination in the Blue Bell Creameries ice cream products and immediately removed all Blue Bell Creameries products from all Via Christi locations once the potential contamination was discovered," Loving said in a statement Friday to The Associated Press.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Via Christi has eight hospitals in Kansas and Oklahoma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Blue Bell handles all of its own distribution and customer service, Cruse said, so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves, most of them institutional, as soon as it was alerted to the South Carolina contamination Feb. 13.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Cruse did not suspect handling of those products after they left the Central Texas creamery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"The only time it can be contaminated is at the time of production," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>That contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies, and that machine remains off line, he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>All products now on store and institution shelves are safe and wholesome, Cruse said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>However, "contaminated ice cream products may still be in the freezers of consumers, institutions, and retailers, given that these products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years," the CDC statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>CDC recommends that consumers do not eat products that Blue Bell Creameries removed from the market, and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Listeriosis is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes, the CDC said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>The disease primarily affects pregnant women and their newborns, older adults, and people with immune systems weakened by cancer, cancer treatments, or other serious conditions (like diabetes, kidney failure, liver disease, and HIV).</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Rarely, people without these risk factors are affected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>A person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has invasive infection, meaning the bacteria spread from their intestines to the blood, causing bloodstream infection, or to the central nervous system, causing meningitis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Although people can sometimes develop listeriosis up to 2 months after eating contaminated food, symptoms usually start within several days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics, the CDC said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Ice cream girl gets last laugh!</td></tr>
