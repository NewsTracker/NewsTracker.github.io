<h3>CANNES WATCH: Andie MacDowell speaks on her Cannes regret</h3>

<tr><td>7</td><td>"I try to stay out of their way; they're really independent," she said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>"They're very independent, they're their own people. I think what I've taught them they've really taken. They have really good work ethics. I have a really good work ethic. I'm on time, I'm appreciative, I give one hundred percent and I don't complain."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>MacDowell, who stars in the Hallmark television series "Cedar Cove" and is in this summer's "Magic Mike XXL," was in Cannes as a brand ambassador for L'Oreal.</td></tr>
