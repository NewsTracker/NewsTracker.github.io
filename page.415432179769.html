<h3>The Penis Transplant Is Not A Breakthrough Yet</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>One of the surgeons involved in the operation even trumpeted the results as "a massive breakthrough" in a press release from his institution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Allow me to deflate the party somewhat on this "breakthrough."</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>As described, the surgeons sewed very small nerves and vessels together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>This is done every day, in every hospital in the US (think vasectomy reversal).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>There is nothing surgically novel about sewing two ends of a urethra together or really small blood vessels either for that matter (remember that John Wayne Bobbitt's severed penis was sewn back on relatively quickly).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Significantly penile transplantation has been done before.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In 2006 a group of Chinese urologists did the exact procedure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Unfortunately for all involved, the gentlemen removed the transplanted penis himself 14 days later.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>But long-term function is a different - and major - issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The penis in question has only been functioning for a few months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>It is the long-term function that is important, particularly in light of the fact that rejection of transplanted organs often takes years, not months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Would the headlines be different if the patient loses his penis next month?</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Or if he develops a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, which is commonly deadly?</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The good news: The patient appears to be doing well and has erections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The surgery was done in early December of last year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The BBC says "the man is able to pass urine, have an erection, orgasm and ejaculate."</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>One media misconception laid to rest: If he had a 1 cm penis to begin with (as described) then his ability to orgasm and ejaculate were already preserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It is the erection and urinary ability that is new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>But similar, albeit perhaps more strident sentiments, were expressed when the first double-hand transplant and face transplant patients were announced.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And how is that going?</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Well, I would say extremely slowly but with some limited success.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>According to Dr. Vu Nguyen, a reconstructive and plastic surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh, the challenge with hand transplants continues to be finding safe pharmaceuticals that create an immunologically tolerant atmosphere between the host and the hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Since the reports in 2008 around 40 hand transplants have been done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>You can look them up at handregistry.com.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>My larger concern for these patients is that most of these young men whom the operation could be helpful for are not living in medically accessible regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>As outlined by reports from the CRL Commission in South Africa, over 500,000 men were hospitalized from ritual circumcisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>Transplanting the penis was the easy part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Taking care of it will be the really hard part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Transplant patients need constant blood work, medication changes, biopsies, and exams (remember the first hand transplant patient refused to take his meds - and his hand was removed).</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>For patient's who live in remote areas of the world with limited medical care a penis transplant is not going to help and unlikely to be a common procedure in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Sorry. I wish I thought differently.</td></tr>

<h3>U.S. healthcare worker with Ebola in 'serious' condition, NIH says</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>The National Institutes of Health said the U.S. Ebola patient was flown into the United States earlier on Friday and admitted to the NIH's high-security containment facility in Maryland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The patient is the 11th person with the deadly virus treated in the United States.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The NIH said the patient was in serious condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The NIH did not release any more details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The aid group Partners In Health said in a statement that the clinician was working for them in Sierra Leone, and noted their colleague "remains in good spirits."</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said another American volunteering in Sierra Leone had "potential exposure" to that patient and was being transported to the Atlanta area to be near Emory University Hospital, which has treated other Ebola patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The developments followed a relatively quiet period for Ebola in the United States, a reminder that while the spread of the virus has eased somewhat in West Africa, it still remains dangerous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The CDC said that as a result of the latest case it is working to trace the contacts of volunteers combating Ebola in Sierra Leone, including several other Americans, who may have been exposed to the healthcare worker now at the NIH.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The CDC said none of these other people, including the one headed to Atlanta, has tested positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>However, the CDC said it was working with the State Department to develop plans to return those Americans with potential exposure to the United State, where they will isolate themselves and be under direct CDC monitoring 21 days.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A British healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola while in Sierra Leone was flown back this week to Britain, along with four others who are being monitored for possible infection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the agency's team in Sierra Leone is still gathering information but said there is no evidence so far that the U.S. and British cases are related.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>While the virus has killed about 10,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, only a handful of cases have been seen in the United States, Spain and Britain.</td></tr>
