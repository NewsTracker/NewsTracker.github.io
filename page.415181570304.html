<h3>WIRELESS SHOW HIGHLIGHTS: Eyes on Apple, BlackBerry</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Apple's campaign comes as Samsung unveiled new phones with improved photo-taking capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The two companies have been fierce rivals, and one research firm said Tuesday that Apple bested Samsung as the world's top smartphone maker in the last three months of 2014.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Apple Inc. isn't at the Mobile World Congress show this week, but is making its presence felt, as new phones are inevitably compared with iPhones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Apple has its own event Monday in San Francisco, where it's expected to reveal more details about its upcoming smartwatch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Apple is turning over a large portion of its home page, along with billboard and print ads in dozens of cities, to photos from its "Shot on iPhone 6" campaign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The company collected photos from 77 users around the world by combing through Flickr, Instagram and other sites (and getting permissions from the photographers).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Apple is featuring 57 photos and three videos from those users at http://apple.com/worldgallery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The rest are on print ads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Apple is seeking to show that people can take quality images with iPhones, without needing to buy and carry a stand-alone camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The photo captions describe what makes each image stand out and present tips and information on any apps and accessories used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The campaign launched Sunday just as Samsung Electronics Co. announced its new Galaxy S6 phones, which promise improved focus, low-light capabilities and color adjustments to account for ambient light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Before iPhones came around, there was the BlackBerry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But iPhones - and later, Android phones - showed people that smartphones can do much more than email and calls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>BlackBerry was late in modernizing its operating system to offer those capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>At the show Tuesday, BlackBerry CEO John Chen reiterated the company's "philosophical" shift away from merely making devices to becoming a leader in software, especially for businesses and even rivals such as Samsung.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Nonetheless, BlackBerry said it may launch four new smartphones over the coming year, including the BlackBerry Leap, a "low-to-mid" market phone that will go on sale in Europe in April.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Although the Leap has a touch-screen keyboard, BlackBerry's head of devices, Ron Louks, told The Associated Press that BlackBerry remains committed to making models with its signature physical keyboards.</td></tr>
