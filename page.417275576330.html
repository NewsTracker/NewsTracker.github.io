<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>CLEVELAND (AP) -- Josh Hamilton has played in two World Series, appeared in five All-Star Games and won a Most Valuable Player Award.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>He also reached on a key error in the seventh inning that led to the winning run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The 2010 AL MVP came up with runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh inning with the score 8-all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He hit an easy tapper back to pitcher Zach McAllister, whose throw was well over the head of first baseman Carlos Santana for a two-base error.</td></tr>

<tr><td>14</td><td>He was moved to right in the ninth inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>The Rangers didn't arrive in Cleveland until 4 a.m. after completing a three-game sweep in Yankee Stadium on Sunday night, but they looked like a refreshed bunch in Hamilton's return.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>''Mentality's everything,'' he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>''You start winning some ballgames, guys get a lot of confidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>It goes from hitting to pitching to playing defense, so I like it, man.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>I like winning and the situation I'm in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Rangers manager Jeff Banister told Hamilton before the game to fit in and play his game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>''First major league game back, looked fine,'' Banister said.</td></tr>
