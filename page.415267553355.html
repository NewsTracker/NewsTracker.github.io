<h3>CIA chief announces sweeping reorganization of US spy agency</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Brennan announced the restructuring to the CIA workforce, including a new directorate devoted to boosting the CIA's computer hacking skills.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>He said the move comes after nine agency officers spent three months analyzing its management structure, including what deputy CIA director David Cohen called "pain points," organizational areas where the CIA's bureaucracy does not work efficiently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Briefing reporters with Cohen at CIA headquarters this week, Brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the CIA is not covering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>He lamented that there is often no single person he can hold accountable for the spying mission in any given part of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"There are a lot of areas that I would like to have better insight to, better information about, better access to," Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Safe havens, denied areas. Whether because we don't even have a diplomatic presence in a country, or because there are parts of countries that have been overrun and taken over by terrorist groups and others."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The changes Friday come against a backdrop of evidence that the CIA's focus on hunting and killing terrorists since the Sept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>11 attacks has led to an erosion of the espionage and analytic capabilities the agency built during the Cold War.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>The CIA, along with other U.S. intelligence agencies, wrongly assessed the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2002 and failed to anticipate the rapid collapse of Middle East governments during the Arab Spring in 2011, among other shortcomings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>The agency's greatest public success of recent years " the 10-year effort to locate and kill Osama bin Laden in 2011 " may have taken longer than it should have, according to evidence made public in the recent Senate report on CIA interrogations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Internal CIA surveys have cited bad management and bureaucratic frustration as factors in driving talent away from the agency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Under Brennan's reorganization, the CIA would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms, a system that typically has required the case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations to work for different bosses, in different offices, than analysts who interpret the intelligence and write briefing papers for the president and other policymakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The new plan would blend practitioners of those separate disciplines into 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>There are a handful of such centers at the moment, including the Counter Terrorism Center, where analysts and operators have worked side by side for the last decade targeting al-Qaida with espionage and drone strikes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Under the new plan, each center would be run by an assistant director who would be responsible for the entire intelligence mission within that jurisdiction, including covert operations, spying, analysis, liaison with foreign partners and logistics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>The system of CIA stations, headed by a CIA station chief, will remain in place, Brennan said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Most stations are in U.S. embassies, and various CIA case officers in embassies may be working on different missions for different centers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The changes do not require congressional approval and will be undertaken within the CIA's current budget, CIA officials said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Critics of a blended approach have raised concerns that combining analysts with operators could compromise the objectivity of the analysts, who are tasked with coldly interpreting intelligence in which they have no stake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>It may be harder for an analyst to cast doubt on a source recruited by a case officer he knows personally, the theory goes.</td></tr>

<h3>Today's Lisa Wilkinson hammers Christopher Pyne over Bali Nine duo</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A fired-up Wilkinson said there had been a 'full blown and seemingly over the top operation' as Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were transferred from Kerobokan prison in Bali to the Indonesian 'death island' of Nusakambangan on Wednesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>She also pointed out to Pyne and Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese that Bali's police chief was 'all smiles as he took photos with the two men condemned to death'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>'Elite military vehicles, decoy vehicles, fighter jets, riot squad police - you would have to say right now that president Widodo, rather than listening to the Australian government's pleas for clemency, he's treating these men like prize catches, he's thumbing his nose at us right now isn't he?,' Wilkinson asked Pyne.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>'To be fair, the Indonesian justice system and President Widodo is treating the Australian prisoners the same as all the other foreign prisoners in Indonesia,' Pyne diplomatically replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>'No that's not true Christopher because one of the other drug smugglers who was also going to face the firing squad left in an unmarked van to go to the same island facing the same death,' Wilkinson retorted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>'But you are apologising for him Christopher, with the greatest respect,' Wilkinson said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>'I'm certainly not doing that Lisa I am opposed to the death penalty,' Pyne reasoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The pictures in question emerged on Thursday of a smiling police commissioner posing with the two condemned Australian drug smugglers on the two hour flight to Nusakambangan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Australia will lodge an official complaint with Indonesia's Ambassador, Nadjib Kesoema, at their outrage and ethical displeasure with these images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>One of the pictures depicts Djoko Hari Utomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, placing his hand on Chan's shoulder and smiling for the camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Another shows his hand on the shoulder of Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Although summoned to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ambassador Kesoema is understood to be in Perth and cannot appear in person.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A senior official, likely to be department secretary Peter Varghese will inform the ambassador of Australia's shock at the images through a telephone call whilst also appealing again for clemency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Utomo told Fairfax Media that he was trying to raise the spirits of the Australians by urging them to be tough and brave and had no idea the photo was being taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Complaints will also be made about the excessive use of force used in transporting the men from Bali's Kerobokan prison to the airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Thursday that she could not comprehend the enormous display of force by the Indonesian military.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>When the images were captured on Wednesday, the Bali Nine duo were being transported on a two hour flight to the port town of Cilacap and transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as 'Death Valley', a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The spot is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan, which is also known as 'Death Island', and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the Indonesian Government executed five drug smugglers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>And this place, up a winding dirt track just 3km from where Chan and Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells, is likely to soon be their last place on earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>At around 12.40am on January 18 this year, five drug traffickers were reportedly shot by firing squads in or around this place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Indonesia executed a total of six drug traffickers on January 18, but Vienamese woman Tran Thi Bich Hanh met her fate on the mainland of central java at a place called Boyolali.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>The five executed at Nirbaya on Nuskambangan were Brazilian Marco Archer Moreiea, 53, who smuggled 13kg of coaine in hangliding equipment to Bali in 2004, Dutch national Ang Kiem Soei, who ran an Ecstasy factory, Namaona Denis, 48, Indonesian woman, Rani Andriani, 38, and Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, 38, a Muslim who elected to be buried on the island.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>Do the best, God will finish the rest'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled for each prisoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.</td></tr>
