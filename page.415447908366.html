<h3>Sierra Leone's vice president asks U.S. for asylum</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) - Sierra Leone's vice president sought asylum on the United States on Saturday, saying he no longer felt safe in the country after soldiers disarmed the security team at his residence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>"I don't feel safe this morning as vice president," Samuel Sam-Sumana told The Associated Press by phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>He said he was not at his residence and declined to disclose his whereabouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>After hearing that soldiers were heading to his home Saturday morning, Sam-Sumana said he tried and failed to contact President Ernest Bai Koroma.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Instead, he said he reached top officials at the presidential guard who informed him his security team was being disarmed on orders from the president.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Sam-Sumana said he then called U.S. Ambassador John Hoover and requested asylum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>"They're having a meeting and they will get back to me," the vice president said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>U.S. embassy spokeswoman Hollyn Green said Saturday that embassy officials, including Hoover, had "seen the news" but could not provide any reaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"There is no comment at the moment and there is no action on our part," Green said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Sam-Sumana was expelled from the ruling All People's Congress political party last week, accused of "orchestrating political violence" and trying to form a new party in his home district of Kono, located in the country's Eastern Province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An announcement read out on state media also accused Sam-Sumana of "harboring a group of thugs."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>"The decision was taken to preserve the integrity of the party and discourage political violence in the country," the statement said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Sam-Sumana is also currently under Ebola quarantine after a member of his security team died of the disease, which has ravaged Sierra Leone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Despite his expulsion from the party and his quarantine, he officially remained vice president, meaning responsibility for running the country falls to him if Koroma travels abroad.</td></tr>
