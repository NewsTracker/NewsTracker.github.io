<h3>Costa Rican airport reopens after volcano eruption</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) - Smoke and ash spewing high into the sky from the Turrialba volcano led officials to cancel classes in a dozen nearby schools Friday and disrupted operations at Costa Rica's principal airport.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Juan Santamaria international airport in the capital, San Jose, reopened around midday Friday after remaining closed through Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The Turrialba volcano erupted three times Thursday and state observers recorded a smaller eruption Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Costa Rica's air security agency said ash on the runways could pose a risk as could the impaired visibility from the plume of ash.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The local Tobias Bolanos airport also was closed intermittently.</td></tr>
