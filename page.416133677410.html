<h3>Latest on Apple Watch release: Trying it on</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>A customer tries on an Apple Watch at an Apple Store in Hong Kong Friday, April 10, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>From Beijing to Paris to San Francisco, the Apple Watch made its debut Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Customers were invited to try them on in stores and order them online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>11:48 a.m. EDT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Mark Servidio was online in New York at 3 a.m. to order two Apple Watches - Sport models with black bands in large for him and small for his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Six hours later, he was at the 9 a.m. opening of the Apple store on New York's Upper East Side.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>The 30-year-old software developer wanted to check out what he just paid $349 and $399 for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>He'd booked an afternoon appointment, but he decided to try out his luck after seeing there was hardly a line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Store employees were able to accommodate him quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Servidio ended up trying some of the models he didn't buy, just to see what they'd feel like.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>An employee explained some features, though the watches Servidio was allowed to try on were all running in demonstration mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Servidio admits he doesn't really need an Apple Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>But he's curious about what it can do and thinks it might make checking messages and other notifications less intrusive than pulling out his phone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>11:26 a.m. EDT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>S&P Capital IQ analyst Angelo Zino predicts Apple will sell 10 million watches in 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>"Our view is it's going to take time for the consumer to adopt wearable technology," Zino said in an interview.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>"We're very positive on the long-term trends for wearables and we think Apple is going to be a clear leader in the category."</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>He thinks initial sales are going to be below expectations, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Because the smartwatch is a new category of product, Apple will have to work harder to show customers what it can do, Zino says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>The company is encouraging customers to make appointments to try the watch and some of its features, before ordering it online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>That's a departure from its approach to the iPhone and iPad, which have been sold on a first-come, first-served basis to customers who often line up at Apple stores on the first day those products are available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>"They had to change their sales strategy," Zino said of the watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>"It's not a standardized product, so you need to make consumers aware of the customization that's available, and you can't take the approach you've taken with other products."</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>11:11 a.m. EDT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Employees of the Lenox Square Mall's Apple store in Atlanta clapped and cheered as customers streamed through its glass doors just before 10 a.m. About 20 people had lined up outside the second-floor storefront.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Marcus Martin, a self-described "gadget" guy from Columbus, Ohio, was first in line with his wife and smiled broadly after leaving the store with an order placed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>He said it was a long-anticipated gift for his birthday on Saturday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>"It's very user-friendly, and that was a question I had in my mind," he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>He especially likes the watch's ability to turn off when a user's arm swings down, hoping that feature will save battery life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Steve Kaip and his 15-year-old son Jason also were among the first in the store.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>On a spring break trip to Atlanta from their home in Novi, Michigan, they're planning to place an order when they get home, preserving their "early adopter" status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>"I don't wear a watch today, but I'm considering wearing a watch if it did more than just tell time," Steve Kaip says.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>"The calendar function letting you know an event is coming up with a buzz on your wrist, instead of wherever your phone is, that's good."</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>11:09 a.m. EDT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster estimates that launch day supply (the models available for shipping on April 24th) was largely sold out within the first 10 to 30 minutes of going on sale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>"We view this as an indication of solid demand paired with very limited supply, with supply being the most significant limiting factor," he writes in a note Friday morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>10:57 a.m. EDT (7:57 a.m. PDT).</td></tr>
