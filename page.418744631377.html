<tr><td>10</td><td>NEW YORK (AP) - Google's new service for organizing and backing up images blends some of the best of what Apple and Yahoo have rolled out in recent months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>These services come as smartphone cameras get better, and people take more photos and video with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The problem is many of the images simply sit on the phones, taking up valuable space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Worse, digital memories can disappear when phones are lost or stolen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Photo services from Google, Yahoo and Apple all store copies of those photos and video online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Images taken with tablets and stand-alone cameras can be added, too, giving you one home for your entire image library.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>These services also offer editing tools and help organize your images.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>After all, why bother taking photos if you can't find them later?</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>The latest offering, Google Photos, isn't perfect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Recently, Google apologized when the service mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>And there's a catch with free storage of photos and video.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>On the other hand, Google has the best tools for searching photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>That's no surprise, coming from the world's most popular search engine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Here's a look at Google Photos and how it compares with Apple's and Yahoo's offerings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Just download the Google Photos app on your iPhone, iPad or Android device and connect over Wi-Fi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Photos and video on your device will automatically upload to Google's servers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Google offers unlimited storage of photos of up to 16 megapixels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>That covers iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td>For the few phones that exceed that, Google will either reduce the file size or let you store the original as part of a free allotment shared with Gmail messages and other Google services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td><td>You get 15 gigabytes, enough for a few thousand photos at 16 megapixels, after which you pay $2 or more a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>If you choose to store the originals, all photos will count toward the quota, including those under 16 megapixels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>Unless you're looking for poster-size prints, 16 megapixels is fine for printing, but the extra pixels help when cropping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Free video storage is limited to 1080p high-definition resolution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>That's fine for iPhones, but many devices including the Galaxy S6 phones can shoot better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>Again, you can choose to reduce the size or pay for more storage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>Apps for Mac and Windows PCs will search your computer and camera memory cards for photos to upload.</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>The same size limits apply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>Flickr, a similar service from Yahoo, has no size limit on individual files, but you get 1 terabyte for your entire collection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td><td>That's likely more than enough unless you're a professional or serious photographer, in which case Yahoo likely wouldn't be for you because it doesn't handle images in the higher-quality RAW format.</td></tr>
<tr><td>39</td><td>Apple's Photos app syncs images from iPhones, iPads and Mac computers only, not Android or Windows devices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>You have 5 gigabytes of free iCloud storage, shared with other Apple services, so you'll likely need to buy storage starting at $1 a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td>With Google and Yahoo, you need to delete images from your phone to free up space once they transfer online.</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td>With Apple, the service automatically reduces the file size when space is low and grabs the originals online when needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td>That makes it seamless for users, but Apple's storage quota isn't as generous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>All three services offer basic tools for touching up photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td>Apple's Photos app on the Mac has the most advanced options.</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>With all three services, changes you make on one device will sync with the others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Google also has tools to automatically create collages and animations out of batches of photos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>Once online, you can view images from any device, no matter which camera they came from.</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td>You can easily share those images, too, with just a tap or two.</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Don't worry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>Unless you share an image or album, it's for your eyes only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>Google, Apple and Yahoo use computer software to tag photos to help you find them more easily.</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>Google and Apple use face-recognition technology to sort photos by individuals, while Yahoo knows only that there's someone there - not who.</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>Google was even smart enough to automatically group together photos of the same person at 2 months old and 6 years old (though it missed the ones from right after birth).</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>With Apple, you can link them manually on a Mac.</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>Apple's index is stored on the app, rather than online, limiting what the company has on you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Google does the analysis online, but insists it doesn't attach faces to specific individuals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>Although privacy is something to consider, it isn't much different from trusting Google with your email and searches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>As for objects, Google and Yahoo let you search for "boat" to get photos containing boats, even if "boat" isn't in the file name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>That's because the companies scan images to identify common objects and attributes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61</td><td>You can remove a tag when there's a mistake, but you can't add your own.</td></tr>
<tr><td>62</td><td>What if you have a bunch of boat pictures, might you start seeing ads for sailing lessons?</td></tr>
<tr><td>63</td><td>Google and Yahoo say they have no current plans to target ads that way, but neither ruled it out.</td></tr>
