<h3>Hillary Clinton slams Bush on immigration, women's health</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks to supporters during a campaign rally at La Rumba, a Denver dance club and restaurant, Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2015.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>DENVER (AP) - Hillary Clinton on Tuesday repeatedly slammed Jeb Bush and the rest of the Republican presidential field over immigration and women's health during a campaign stop in Denver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Bush is more dovish than the rest of the Republican presidential field and supports legal status for millions of people in the country illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>But Clinton contended that Bush the former Florida governor backed policies that would break up families and put them at risk for deportation, and noted that he, like almost all of the rest of the GOP field, refuses to back citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship," Clinton said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"There is no place in the United States for second-class citizenship."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Clinton also criticized Bush for questioning the amount the federal government spends on women's health during a forum earlier Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>His campaign later said he was actually arguing the federal government should use the money it gives to Planned Parenthood elsewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clinton, running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said that was just as bad - and noted that the entire GOP field agrees with Bush.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"When you attack Planned Parenthood, you attack women's health, and when you attack women's health, you attack America's health," Clinton said to cheers from hundreds of Democrats crowded into a small Denver nightclub.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Sounding hoarse but feisty, Clinton ripped into the GOP, comparing herself to fictional Los Angeles police Sgt. Joe Friday from the TV show "Dragnet" and promising to give "just the facts."</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>She called the Monday night New Hampshire forum where 14 of the Republican presidential candidates spoke "a recitation of out-of-date, out-of-touch policies."</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Clinton's appearance was sandwiched between three fundraisers in Aspen, Denver and its suburbs.</td></tr>
