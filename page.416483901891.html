<h3>There's an Android Robot Urinating on the Apple Logo in Google Maps</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>We can&#x2019;t explain it but we&#x2019;re certain&#xA0;someone will have to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>For unknown reasons, Google Maps now contains a cartoon of Android&#x2019;s robot mascot&#xA0;relieving itself on the Apple logo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The image, found near the city of Rawalpindi in Pakistan, was first spotted by Cult of Android and at the time of writing is still &#x2014; unbelievably &#x2014; live.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Although some people have labelled it an Easter Egg, it seems beyond the pale of the usual corporate one-upmanship that Google and Apple occasionally indulge in.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>It&#x2019;s also only visible on the map view &#x2014; not in the satellite pictures &#xA0;&#x2014; ruling out the possibility of diehard Pakistani Android fans sticking it to those iPhone suckers with a carefully-mown field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The same image zoomed out a little more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Whatever&#x2019;s going on, it&#x2019;s certainly not a lone issue for Google.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>As&#xA0;The Guardian points out, just a mile or so to the east, buried in a patch of green in the map layer, you can see the words &#x201C;Google review policy is crap&#x201D; next to a frowny-face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>A week and a half ago there was also the mysterious appearance of&#xA0;Edward Snowden in the White House &#x2014; or, at least, a business listing for a snowboard shop named &#x201C;Edward&#x2019;s Snow Den&#x201D; with the location changed to&#xA0;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Whatever&#x2019;s going on, it looks like Google Maps needs to get a grip on its territory.</td></tr>
