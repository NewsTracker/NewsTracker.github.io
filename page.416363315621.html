<h3>Team Penske cars wreck each other at rain-soaked Bristol (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>(AP) -- Brad Keselowski spun into teammate Joey Logano minutes into Sunday's race at Bristol Motor Speedway, where rain was wreaking havoc on the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Persistent rain delayed the start more than an hour, and NASCAR rushed to get the event underway during a brief window.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Several drivers rushed to their cars moments before Jeff Gordon's two children, Ella and Leo, gave the command to start the engines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Although it was damp and cold when the race began, there weren't any issues until the 20th lap, when Keselowski spun trying to get around a lapped car.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>He spun directly into Team Penske teammate Joey Logano, and both cars were heavily damaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The incident happened just as it began to rain again, and NASCAR stopped the race to wait out the shower.</td></tr>
