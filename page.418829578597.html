<h3>Obama pushes Kenya to root out corruption</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Despite being given a hero's welcome, President Obama talked tough to Kenyans in a Sunday speech in which he said the nation was "at a crossroads" between promise and peril.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Obama, in his first presidential visit to the nation of his father's birth, gave a raucus speech in which he pushed the leaders of the east African country to root out corruption and provide better treatment to women and minorities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>"The future of Africa is up to Africans," Obama told the crowd packed into a sports arena in the capital of Nairobi.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>"You can choose the path to progress, but it requires making some important choices," Obama said, before emphasizing that leaders must crack down on corruption and practice tolerance for minority communities.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>"Too often here in Kenya corruption is tolerated because that's how it's always been done," Obama said, calling corruption an "anchor" that is weighing down the nation's otherwise bright future.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>"Here in Kenya, it's time to change habits."</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In the wideranging 45-minute speech, Obama also encouraged citizens to work to end centuries-long tribal and ethnic tensions that are "doomed to tear our country apart," and urged Kenyans to respect the rights of women, saying that marginalizing half of a country's population was "stupid."</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The President, who was welcomed passionately, also called for the end of forced marriages for young girls and the controversial tradition known as genital mutilation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>"These traditions may date back centuries. They have no place in the 21st century," he said, before drawing a comparison between those practices and a law passed earlier in South Carolina removing the Confederate flag from the grounds of the State House there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>"Just because something is a part of your past doesn't make it right," Obama said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>In a speech a day earlier, Obama also pressed Kenyans to stop discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15</td><td>The visit, Obama's first as President and his first since 2006, when he was still at U.S. senator, generated enormous excitement across the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Large crowds lined the roadways to watch the presidential motorcade speed through the city Sunday, some climbing on rooftops to get a better view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Meanwhile, the spellbound audience inside the arena chanted his name as he finished his remarks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>As Obama prepared to board Air Force One on Sunday afternoon, he paused and waved to the crowd, with a grin on his face, appearing to savor the moment.</td></tr>
