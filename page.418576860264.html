<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td>Soccer|Ex-FIFA Executive Jeffrey Webb Extradited to U.S.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Ex-FIFA Executive Jeffrey Webb Extradited to U.S.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Jeffrey Webb, a former top official at FIFA, has agreed to extradition and is currently in the United States, a person who has been briefed on the investigation confirmed Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mr. Webb is the first of the 14 soccer officials and marketing executives indicted in May to be sent to the United States from abroad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The Swiss Justice Department said last week that one of the seven FIFA officials arrested and detained in Switzerland had agreed to be extradited in a simplified procedure, but did not name the official.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Until his indictment, Mr. Webb was president of Concacaf, the regional confederation representing Central and North America and the Caribbean, since 2012.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>He was also a vice president of FIFA, and he was known for calling for reform within the organization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The indictment charged that he asked for bribes in return for the lucrative television deals regarding soccer games.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>It is unclear when Mr. Webb will make his first United States court appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>His lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>The racketeering and corruption case against the 14 officials and executives, brought in May, sent shock waves through the soccer world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Though many had complained of corruption within FIFA's ranks, and questioned how it awarded the hosting rights to the World Cup, United States prosecutors bringing a case against so many officials at once startled soccer fans and executives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>The arrests, several made in the early-morning hours at a Swiss lakeside hotel where soccer officials had gathered for FIFA's annual congress, only added to the drama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>The case led to the June announcement by Sepp Blatter, FIFA's powerful longtime president, that he would step down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Blatter has not been charged.</td></tr>
