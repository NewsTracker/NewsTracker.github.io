<h3>Red Sox lefty Rodriguez wins MLB debut, 5-1 at Texas (Yahoo Sports)</h3>
<table class="table table-striped"><tr><td>1</td><td><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Eduardo Rodriguez threw 7 2/3 scoreless innings to become the youngest Red Sox starter to win in his major league debut on the road since 1967, and Boston beat the Rangers 5-1 to spoil Josh Hamilton's first home game back in Texas on Thursday night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The 22-year-old Rodriguez was already the youngest Red Sox pitcher to make his MLB debut on the road since 21-year-old Roger Clemens in 1985.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Billy Rohr was 21 when he won in his debut at the New York Yankees on April 14, 1967.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Rodriguez (1-0) struck out seven and walked two, leaving the game with two runners on base in the eighth before Tommy Layne got Shin-Soo Choo on a called third strike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Boston went ahead to stay when Mookie Betts had an RBI single in the fifth off Nick Martinez (4-1).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Ramirez, who was the designated hitter with slumping slugger David Ortiz getting a night off, led off the sixth with his 11th homer of the season to make it 2-0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hamilton was 2-for-4, lining a double into the right-field corner on the first pitch he saw from Rodriguez in the second inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>He added an RBI single in the ninth, on another sharply hit ball to right, to end Boston's shutout bid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Back in Texas a month and a day after being re-acquired from the Los Angeles Angels, the 2010 AL MVP had gone 1-for-11 in his first three games after reuniting with the team Monday in Cleveland.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Martinez struck out five and walked two while scattering nine hits over seven innings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>The righty allowed two runs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>Boston added three runs in the eighth, including Blake Swihart's two-run single after two walks and a hit batsman the previous three batters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>Red Sox manager John Farrell indicated before the game that Ortiz could get several days off, giving him a chance to work on some things.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Ortiz had one hit in 20 at-bats his previous five games, and is hitting .216 with six home runs and 18 RBIs in 43 games this season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Red Sox: SS Xander Bogaerts sustained a bruised left forearm after being hit by a pitch near his wrist in the second inning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>The pitch ricocheted off his forearm and high into the screen behind home plate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Rangers: LHP Derek Holland threw for the first time since April 10, the home opener when he threw just one inning before leaving with strained left shoulder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Holland said he made 20 throws from 60 feet and ''felt good.'' ... LHP Matt Harrison (spinal fusion surgery) is scheduled to throw a bullpen session Sunday in Texas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Harrison struck out nine with no walks in five innings of an extended spring training game Thursday in Arizona.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Red Sox: Boston RHP Steven Wright (2-1, 3.68 ERA) faces Texas for the first time in his career.</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td><td>Rangers: Texas righty Yovani Gallardo (4-6, 4.13) has allowed three earned runs or less in eight of his last nine starts.</td></tr>
